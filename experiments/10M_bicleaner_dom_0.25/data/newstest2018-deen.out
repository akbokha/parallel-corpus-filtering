Munich , 1856 : four maps , which change its view to the city
an er@@ r An@@ st@@ alt , where young people will meet today .
a greeting chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is nervous when maps are not currently current .
that knows what you had to off@@ end because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i had a green meadow instead of a stra@@ b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern attributes , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria within the state government , are everything else - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I , one recogni@@ zes them as such .
in the large over@@ look card , more detailed maps , called ur@@ inary tract , were incorporated for cities and communities .
these were originated according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 and of the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French Armed Forces occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and had a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
finally , when French troops arrived at the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , the neighbours today that the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map were created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph drove the project ahead , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundation for Munich is from the year 1856 and can be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison / Today is the example of the state capital on the most impressive .
in all directions the city has expanded and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ missions , which is still relatively isolated in the card from 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the card , i.e. 1877 , the Munich quarter .
today is under@@ send@@ ling in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ missions concentrate around 1856 along with today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can &apos;t see anything as fields - at first glance : in entering zo@@ oming a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten passage from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; which was derived from the base tax .
today , small plots have no farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the grounds &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Lower send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow , and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of Is@@ ar gives the historical map an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the rehear@@ sal view , in the area of the today &apos;s District Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , you do not only read the street name &quot; at the guest house &quot; or from the height &quot; On the lu@@ te &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; er@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field Road one finds people with mad@@ ness .
there was the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; in 1858 / 59 .
starting in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den managed the institution , that he was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended the purchase of the so @-@ called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he also taught the staff to use violence against the use , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places was expanded .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ irrit@@ ation institute in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s .
youth up in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um is now on the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 and went in a youth house with vocational training .
located west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; established in an architectural re@@ jection of the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , destroyed during the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was around 1856 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merchants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also at the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies began in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a sal@@ utation at the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
the old Munich @-@ card can be res@@ cu@@ ed with the aerial photo of today &apos;s aerial view and fill the hole at Mari@@ enhof .
Mayor Group publishes it@@ iner@@ ation for Missouri
the National Union for the promotion of dy@@ es has issued a warning for colored people who travel to the state of the dis@@ crimin@@ ating policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri , which is scheduled to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ ce@@ ans , since a series of frag@@ ile , r@@ ary @-@ based inci@@ dents in the entire state , and here is stated , &quot; it is stated in the opinion of the Group .
a recently approved law of Missouri , which makes people heavy , discrimin@@ ating discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state to admit the un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate to min@@ orities , the Group said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have bre@@ aches of the civil rights that happen to men .
they will be broken down or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard nor heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the Group cited Inci@@ dents such as ra@@ cial Ver@@ sions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
he died in frag@@ ile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any more fuel and had been accused by the police of Missouri in custody without any crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the offices of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri in which black drivers in the state will be able to hold 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of people and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be willing to bring out whether they would like to bring ? or the relatives know that they are travelling by the state . &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri was recorded by the FBI in 2015 , following the latest numbers from the Hass@@ elt review of the FBI , which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the journey is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued it@@ iner@@ aries for Texas and Arizona , to under@@ take the local prosecution authorities to under@@ take people for mig@@ rant violations , which will contribute to the list of the AC@@ L@@ U for further rac@@ tion .
it@@ iner@@ ations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but at the last time , stakeh@@ olders have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is Elem@@ ental
the fis@@ erb@@ ach electric fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU federal parliament Peter white and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have delivered a picture before the spot .
at the court yard of Schwen@@ n@@ mann , the representative of the CDU village group met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ n@@ mann set first insights into its operation in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest far@@ med , 40 dairy cows , and as many young ones and houses in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative comp@@ elling away for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ n@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eby comes exclusively regional .
since he is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the &quot; &quot; Elem@@ ental project &quot; as an element name . &quot;
I cannot produce steep areas on such steep surfaces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land care for a lot of work , and much need to be mach@@ ined with the sense sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Pi@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the office and covered this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it lead to bio @-@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers need to be supported .
one hope so that the dri@@ fting of surfaces could be gone up for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure whom we have , are people who work in agriculture and thoughts about how they keep going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in cr@@ iti@@ que in the criticism
a total of 25 plots were enclosed in 2013 of eleven participants throughout 2013 .
the open area is therefore 40 hectares , which cannot be fed until at least 2023 .
of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half of them were promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the town of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus they did not keep the farmers to invest € 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of wheat fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ n@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regional integration line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the objective is the closing of the Black Forest .
a pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a funding from the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the ad@@ missible area must not be bad @-@ growing ( Han@@ dic@@ ed above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ her@@ acher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steam project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build at 16 kilometers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate this as well as every other - so the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s seat at the Fir@@ dos square in Baghdad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he had a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated war with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN on the proposal of President to dra@@ stic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller doesn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
one hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty I@@ mit@@ ators could have ar@@ ous@@ ed it if he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the importance that you have been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta im@@ planted , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom that ligh@@ tened the world .
the poem , which you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively properly , but how he formulated it , it is not really about story .
it goes around the contemporary response to the sh@@ atter@@ ing words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state will not only load any old immig@@ rant , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your gar@@ dening , your poor , and your oppressed masses , that tru@@ sts in it , to breathe freely ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gar@@ bage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller served not in literary criticism - he clearly pointed out that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they complete a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ism by present the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom from French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ism .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself gives itself a quite different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great strand as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who wants to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here to something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and a question of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative fact of Lazarus consisted in it , they looked so to see how they were seen from the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible travels on the deck@@ s of ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their refuge and improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to know .
their tor@@ ch should not shine on the way , but the hat@@ red that is the only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of the time when there were only two fle@@ ets to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Champion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to find out until we &apos;ll find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and think that something has done to do what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
what is the combination of the circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was chosen from the team to the team @-@ mates .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is fairly modest .
your capitalist speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or , wherever they live or exercise , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh was quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver med@@ alli@@ sts , which will compete in the fifth world championships for the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
in this way , the central stretch of Mu@@ ir leads to five British and two European records during the last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another but@@ otto that is to be observed after a great season , winning the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the national capit@@ alists says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important thing in this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me to something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it shows just how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ di@@ ums .
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home @-@ World Championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics about Facebook : don &apos;t get rid of a public ministry if you do not wear it from voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the internal politics to its political principles .
he sh@@ ook during the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 1783 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id , and dum@@ b , as sheep for battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who needs to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ an employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ endants this in the beginning of this week .
the staff of the governor said the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he showed a fixed hand during the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence of the principles .
he was also highly sent to use Facebook as a primary agent to link with his voters and play his hair@@ less head to form chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of persons appearing on the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse def@@ ending the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of the tra@@ ys or sp@@ ans or h@@ ass@@ ful@@ filling people that be@@ es the wh@@ ip online .
the Post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments respec@@ t@@ ful , un@@ think@@ able , and not to be prof@@ ited .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , MD , was not ug@@ ly met , but she asked for hate them .
&quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on Hass@@ breaking and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comment field of news &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this idea , if a number of people on the same topic takes place , then it is dis@@ regarded as a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ectively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; others might be &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to use a message by simply blocking a critics or delete a negative comment .
it &apos;s a lot of cleaner than in previous time when men have been done so that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical gui@@ ding angles and to burn or demonstr@@ ators to silence or to silence .
but this just happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises that he has ch@@ imp@@ lied with Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is pro@@ claim from Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a voters of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U for its use by Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
between 1776 and 1800 between 1776 and 1800 , the number of newspapers rose on his lead .
and even then Washington had anonymous trol@@ ls .
the people who did pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
pet@@ itions that crit@@ ici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain crit@@ ici@@ zed his ministry , according to historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t bring them to silence .
speech , freedom of opinion , dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former European Union no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ a@@ ty is hoping for home in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the end of the year , before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and performs as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ a@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry did a great job when he established this place .
he is a di@@ ligent supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great display window for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend the first time in his 32 @-@ year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels especially to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was in the year when I won it out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior tour after his 50th birthday , returns to the promotion at home .
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can do this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed it again , and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how long went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ail .

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , less people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) were present in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer fail@@ ures are attributable to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said position manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved to this topic in 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary fail@@ ures due to passive smoking a year in Germany .

hou@@ sings are considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger road are in full swing and are reasonably priced at the time , &quot; says the head of the Bau@@ ck Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of hou@@ sings be the situation more complicated than suspected , since there is a lot of hide in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which is always ob@@ struc@@ ted for construction work , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ign@@ ore of drivers in front of red lights and bul@@ let trem@@ ble is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the bus buses are entitled to passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were already exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately we were greeted by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooking , it does not use a stove .
they even use only rarely a pot .
in their wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ im@@ en , in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the hou@@ se@@ wife is usually referred to as a &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly to the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the stolen buttons are taken with eggs , un@@ washed hands and swallowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the ground @-@ floor - she has no furniture - wherever they take their daily work , for example Dresses with clou@@ ted water from the nearby sum@@ p .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her husband were not allocated .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late work may be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to pass , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote against the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned to the government of Jak@@ arta that maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal attacks .
in 2003 , the province officially began in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is just as a desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there are no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo waves , and from corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust in different yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have done here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries came to Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates her alive , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ling shirts and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; previously we had only leaves to our physi@@ que . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the warm@@ est province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the biggest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high national provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed at a value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has valued wood resources worth approximately 78 billion US dollars .
however , these wealth are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , who make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a cho@@ king presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local military personnel and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 U.S. dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian claims after bigger autonomy they thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are gn@@ ashed out free .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as has been accredited in the 1970 @-@ s during the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , with the report about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electro@@ supplements are especially popular after another report - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts are reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlements from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim economy originate from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ines sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight for here .
&quot; migrants have started to sell chick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has the local Pap@@ ua - the m@@ om @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and violations of the laws in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured a total of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will accompl@@ ish our hopes that justice becomes restored , &quot; says You .
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ gh@@ tened children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had done drinking , pursu@@ ing and beat the group with their f@@ owl , said victims and witnesses .
then fired one of the soldiers in the group of children .
a child who died 16 year old Y@@ em@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavily defeated that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things granted the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they carried out tro@@ d fighters and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ iti@@ oning - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sei@@ ze stones at police and military post .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command of an internal radio : &quot; if the masses kill more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIM@@ E that was not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping men@@ ace and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was to listen in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned back , I was suddenly shot down in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ay@@ ame is still not sure that he fired , but says that the bul@@ let go out of the rows of the here assembled soldiers .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and bes@@ ought his body to ensure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears as many Indones@@ ians only a name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ese inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ orters that his officers only wanted to secure their station , because they are attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when people dro@@ us to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ list@@ i@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the killing occurred only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ y for the families of the victims and s@@ ware to tackle the historic ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish that this case is immediately resolved so that in the future it will not happen anymore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he viol@@ ates an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations .
but the interpre@@ ting began almost immediately .
&quot; most of injuries occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these verb@@ s , but there are processes running through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he has no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto that accused the UN for crimes against humanity , who demanded more than 1,000 cas@@ u@@ alties in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been laid down , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai pre@@ fecture .
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims participated such claims with fur@@ y un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in an@@ xiety .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , fear , to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai was afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the dead , the army sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sh@@ en@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between village inhabitants and the manager of a b@@ aller@@ ma that refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a close river , died on the way to the hospital .
protest@@ ing vill@@ agers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers stones fell on officers who re@@ acted on it by fire .
but native people say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in close to the hospital &apos;s hospital and witness , as the past here were supplied quickly , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers to the account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police back to the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ser@@ ene for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by em@@ it spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai during the last few years , and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereign@@ ty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a trag@@ ically forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is the same except range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep the most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic ine@@ qualities between local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown rapidly since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region are generally trained to better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua have rarely used the capital or the necessary skills to competitive her own company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , restrictions on the coverage of international media are stra@@ ined .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare license was given to films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is cho@@ ke elec@@ ting the restrictions of coverage to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua report : visa delay and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains to be limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
these countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir showed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on site want to know more foreign governments any knowledge .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human Rights ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session but anonymous .
Indonesia continued to express a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably won &apos;t agree again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good int@@ entions , but he is involved in the people that are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shaft , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ people do not know that there is under the constant threat of a burning military , in poor educ@@ ators and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; bl@@ ame &quot; that he must re@@ pay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ roll@@ ment , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ i @-@ victims led a last symbolic thing : the dead of a sacrifice was buried on a site opposite to the police and the military station .
they may not know that you will never forget justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget the responsible persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with healthy head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest accommodation towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants , of which 337 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings flee .
it is the second fire that moves in only two years through the building , which is called acci@@ dentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up during the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to come down , &quot; told an inhabit@@ ant that declared his name as George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Civi@@ lian agencies said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 00 GMT ) were extingu@@ ished and the buildings burned down .
the government said they work in the provision of accommodation for the person affected .
the incident may recover questions about the security of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings throughout the world .
an investigation into the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest proportion of the damage of the ver@@ covering , the outer covering for decoration or isolation , came .
in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of boards for insulation and clothing at the London Gren@@ coat @-@ Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that affects approximately 80 people .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis court ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis Cup single was only able to play on two winners , skin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classics are thus preserved to the traditional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the members voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore just missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
we will continue to work to improve the application .
even until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the final came into a neutral place after many in@@ consist@@ encies .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following round in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements in training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to accompl@@ ish less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers inc@@ iner@@ ate objects into the plane , finds a pol@@ l
a survey conducted by passengers found that over 20 percent of deliber@@ ate or un@@ aware objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration has been liqui@@ dated , among them at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while they carried out acci@@ dentally knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they could have been delayed , that they are irrit@@ ated with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , it also noted that younger trav@@ eler reviews the rules .
of the respondents agreed that they tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common objects described in T@@ SA agents are confident , food@@ stu@@ ffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have poll@@ uted items with clin@@ ches carried by the security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were also confirmed that they had been un@@ seen drugs into the plane .
the company said it had asked travelers to find out all the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware passed through the airport security and how many would have done it .
it is not a surprise that people who are most common sm@@ ug@@ gling - know@@ ingly , or ignor@@ ant - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company shows that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
humans are often un@@ certain which fluids are allowed to carry them or how much of it is .
thus , there is no surprise that the largest amount of the objects used by the T@@ SA should be associated liquids .
for a long time the people thought , the T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla to cancel his order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are pleased with the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has so far under@@ gone that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales gains and more gigantic sales targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k is betra@@ yed to the announcement of the youngest quarterly balance for the first time : cancellations received by the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k had applied more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
Mus@@ k is now starting : a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been withdrawn already .
critics had always been noted that there are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays € 1000 Euro ( 1000 US dollars ) and the United Kingdom ( 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present , 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations imagine , Mus@@ k will be participating in a telephone conference with analysts .
so that the cancellation of previously around twelve percent of all orders must be solved , the Tesla boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla had supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 , all models have to be assembled - 500,000 one million in 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; to be ordered today at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates to drive its n@@ ag@@ el@@ new , yet never in the practice of producing production lines without any large loads with maximum load capacity .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but comes with greater del@@ ays , then the binding of the reservations may be solved for Tesla .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for then the company can &apos;t have the customer un@@ satisfied customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions by exec@@ uting the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott received P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , its former decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities , compared to current destruction .
he did not mention the complaint against his job in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it comes to a period of time that ran for States on 1 October to keep the 2015 standards for ground @-@ floor ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would be delayed to order the plan to study more time to study the plan , to avoid the plan to tackle the plan , taking into local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump of the Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time a reliable opponent of tough environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has failed to block re@@ mun@@ itions or delayed , to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist .
the sudden change of wed@@ n@@ esday from Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the final provision of the roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court decided that the EPA contrac@@ ted its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama Administration , the oil and gas company dedicated to monitoring and reducing methane lec@@ ks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt showed that his revers@@ al in ozone standards simply beat the will@@ ing@@ ness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administ@@ r@@ ations , the EPA often have failed to carry out the dead@@ lines and others , and in an agreement set the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ endants the EPA for a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by trial procedures , and we take time serious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority which gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt dropped his &quot; compliance to delay and all other legally mentioned products &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules .
in the last month of approval draft law , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years .

tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of the St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery area of Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 pm at a Ser@@ en@@ ade .

the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and Pat@@ rons .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique Mal@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württemberg District Apostle by Count Hermann von Sul@@ z , &quot; the mountain with the evi@@ den@@ ced parish church of tum@@ ours and the Vog@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ lingen mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a man@@ orial court that belonged to the church or Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ righ@@ ted and not vice versa .
so people lived there .
as from the description of the Chief Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 1858 , it was adjacent to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the local picture of tum@@ ours , the &quot; Mount &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village .
old cards from the time around the year 1600 under@@ lines this historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ Right was formed in the early medieval business law .
one Lord , built up a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and also inher@@ ited this y@@ enk@@ irche .
this was the right to send a priest or to the bishop a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two pieces of Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell crashed then in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the window pan@@ es were wrapped and the bel@@ lows were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 , French troops were close to the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church ch@@ ats , and they used it as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ated the remains of the church in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schw@@ eiler .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the bell tower let it stand .
in the New Years of 1834 a storm cut off the steep@@ le tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only today the existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ hab@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the &quot; Schaff@@ ner pension &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .

association wants to check approval from win@@ ders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim refuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and is therefore shifted to the country rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ unds &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ es ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal to take place .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval could not be approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , because at that time , only on the upper limit on Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal already exists a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
they are supposed to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although a few days earlier , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided by changing a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which had not approved the Düsseldorf district government because of a form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of scheduled legal conditions , the author@@ is@@ sion of approval is illegal after un@@ lawful and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of things : the city council decided in front of the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a grant from the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the issu@@ ance of a permit to develop wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of a petition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter have been received since last week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to check the matter once again .
but they do not lead that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a look at the ongoing trial at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday wanted not to be content with the arguments of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four per 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen is medi@@ ately involved , pic@@ king orders with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain closed .
with the development of four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households will be covered , equivalent to one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ axle households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ s@@ ens Stad@@ joined the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ nich in Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .

town and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
from the region , Langen@@ den@@ a@@ er and People from the region are to be dis@@ covering shopping in the city center in September .
the business organization and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to attract the inhabitants of shopping in downtown .
as the chairman of the profession , Christian König , announced , the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend will respond to the customers that offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commod@@ ity .
the market is planned to be a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
the indigenous firms will also present themselves with their training places .
furthermore , the shops of the city center is to invite to &quot; mit@@ ig@@ mas @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the action is not only based on residents of the city and its regions .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag that refer to the promotional weekend , Christian König .
the city administration and commercial association co@@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .

to this end , new offers include the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to be a well @-@ priced and selling Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation on Park@@ charges on this day are part of the concept .
customers should also be new or re@@ signed again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many loc@@ als would have lost the city center when buying a look .
in the end , all of them would have to revi@@ ve the city center - to rent to le@@ aps , all over the city and clubs .
it gel@@ ated to overcome with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy , which had taken part in the spring , had said the king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thuring@@ ian cities will take part in the nationwide third &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; Day .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ s@@ za , Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
the day should be &quot; for the appreci@@ ation of local trade and its importance for the community of our cities stronger , &quot; so Stre@@ ich .
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners are also evident that every citizen can be influenced by their purchase behavior itself .

Tr@@ ump continued after guided tran@@ scripts of telephone call Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone call between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump , in a phone conversation with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto invited him to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned limit dam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president appro@@ ached him because he had finished the wall on public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that can &apos;t say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his campaign in campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first contact with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m @-@ Bull were also released and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. W@@ ump said that a trade for the USA refugees to take off after Australia , &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id &quot; and that the existence was convey@@ ed on the trade that would look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban of res@@ ett@@ lement refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ as , &quot; this is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activ@@ ist @-@ rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice back to
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators at the rural Monroe , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white rider , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way .
the leader of the bul@@ lock - a man @-@ middle age in a wet strike - took a long train at his cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ shield .
penet@@ rating the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams torn the silence , when a young black man was crushed from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , is just one order .
but if a blade is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience was very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 , Mayor of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge comes back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ col@@ o and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an were min@@ ded in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is really invisible that was arrested in all these years - although we see it in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization &apos;s organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the prosecution , we want the end , we want peace , but first of all we must get righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial authorities put a blan@@ ket on the dead bodies of a Moore @-@ Ford &apos;s victims on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , which have been received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding County were suspected of suspected .
but no one was charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in all the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court issued the Black Court of Justice in Georgia , for the first time in order to dis@@ continue their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black Far@@ mp@@ t Roger Mal@@ col@@ t has a white property owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester was sleeping with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby , which she had taken , was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ t from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when it was then removed from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge appro@@ ached , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it presents , it was Harrison that the Mor@@ de prepared and ordered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI &apos;s report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the murder , evidence removed and denied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more interesting .
&quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene has led the yearly closing of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he was no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to look and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that it is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are being con@@ fron@@ ted with its heads in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest black - in a room and listening , as Gre@@ ene a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ er for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ col@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester is scre@@ ed and urged him , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona ordered the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least every black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ cona asked .
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ ing .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; n &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ch is one of the other black actors .
&quot; you just need to meet the hard &apos;@@ R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera body replacing the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making it right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition is violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a dress dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Billi@@ e holidays Trau@@ sin@@ de &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it was a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York to see the performance , many come down the road .
you have seen all almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as cr@@ ushing humidity when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels shar@@ pen@@ ed .
if the last notes of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ders a little boy , as he would remember it .
after a few minutes thanks Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throwing away the Lyn@@ x rope and wo@@ ke up their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who played the C@@ lan@@ ade .
Nick Ras@@ uls um@@ bran@@ t two of his players and then bur@@ ns together into their arms , the emotional burden of performance breaks up with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hat@@ eful one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience puts together with the actors for dinner together .
on a table pl@@ au@@ ts a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated about the tracking with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words that the feeling of performance has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you look and what they look like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really works with me makes me believe that the lig@@ ations still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same space , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Court holds the courtyard at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance of the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because she describes the fear of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production in front of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the rotation platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ out street corner with the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , a open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rh@@ en@@ ish blu@@ ish as a rock girl , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil drums remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ gold boards - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they comp@@ ose Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , crushed in Hollywood Man@@ or a cor@@ k in the boot , and enter the Cra@@ ck@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderful time in Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ iness @-@ weight .
brutal the scene , when he performs Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) must also believe in favor .
the audience was grat@@ eful to the ensemble with stronger appl@@ ause .
the Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , celebrated modest and hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , is fores@@ ee .
great appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which is shown for the first time at stage - in view of the big heat back in Leg@@ erer leisure wear .
with tension expected the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam started .
in 2013 he had to leave a concert of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concerto for himself , five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but it was also a understanding for his vision .
I take a positive conclusion .
max quantity works as volunteers .
they work in their volunte@@ er year at several locations .
where to everywhere ?
a lot : normally , in accordance with the furniture shop , in the week , I help here in Gre@@ ven into the furniture bridge .
and I already worked at the school on the open day .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , thus a late volunte@@ er volunte@@ er .
how does that come ?
amount : I made a high school .
and then a civil engineering , we say once , has been canc@@ eled .
I recognized for me , that it is true for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the burning point maybe even , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the youth @-@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not a bit unusual , during the volunte@@ er service you have several different sites ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to , where one can be FS@@ J .
you can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ettes of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ g , so in the afternoon care .
it was the right thing that led me to me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
other than in civil engineering ?

one has always given other people at the right side , each of which have a very different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up out of the family - you must always go in individually .
very interesting .

P@@ ear@@ son collap@@ sed for a further 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British Educational Group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program would start to overcome the pressure that con@@ fron@@ ts the company with which the company had con@@ fron@@ ted .
the job breakdown , the Director General John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 jobs .
P@@ ear@@ son announced in May in a third cost @-@ cost program for cost reduction of a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step to the digital learning .

con@@ voy of Kabul : NATO @-@ Sol@@ dier killed in suicide attack
a military con@@ voy has attacked a military con@@ voy in the capital of Kabul , killing one troops of NATO and several other injured , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been viol@@ ated by NATO , a declaration by NATO .
un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district , there were also three civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bombing of violence is the last violent war which had taken Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in one position of NATO &apos;s opinion , the explosion occurred on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by one of those who were attacked .
this statement says that all the last in a stable state are located and in the U.S. military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspondence should say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a big concern for NATO troops at nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the UN , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car of at least 30 people killed at a district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US led troops to push the Taliban in 2001 .
the violence emphas@@ ises the pre@@ valent security situation in Afghanistan since the US President Donald Tr@@ ump sei@@ zes the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks also have caused a crisis of public trust in the government to have caused its policies and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ve Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule to Kl@@ ages
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a government regulation of Obama , so that the states are obliged to ins@@ em@@ ate the tu@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency due to step@@ ping people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ozone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they are working together with the commitment of the agency , with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our government partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , the ozone regulations - in which in part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions are to be observed , where single @-@ sections must be made to delay the stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Columbia , filed an action on Tuesday , and said that an effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ ject a broad range of environmental conditions that the former president Barack Obama , as a part of a wider agenda , to push back economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of Democrats and nature groups that wor@@ ried about imp@@ lications of larger emissions to public health .
the website of the EPA tells that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the ozone does not contain &quot; the lung function and ampli@@ fy the respiratory symptoms &quot; like As@@ th@@ ma .
municipality wants to be communal space
at the end , the decision was clearly : in two counter@@ es the council of fluor@@ ine turns to establish the establishment of a joint space in the future @-@ future residential community .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the lack of land was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades reports .
it will continue until today the area of the parish of parish is , however , there is no planning agency for the project which has been a private investor for private investor .
there is a discussion regarding a joint space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , he would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and majority of the community is present , such a common room is not as a meeting point for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ am living environment , but open to the church .
as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; won the round .
the decision , which has been decided by the provision of funds for the current household in autumn , has been decided by funding .
the construction is in the san@@ itation area .
the establishment of a shared space would be , as reported tac@@ tics , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision provides to sign@@ aling the investor that you want to throw away from the legs in this regard , that both ar@@ tic - what is le@@ aning against the ambient construction - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - what the tr@@ ended @-@ height decreases and the construction is possible - can be possible .
unnecessary , not just Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , this supplement is this addition .
when it &apos;s helping : unanim@@ ously passes the panel .
it is not as simple as the common room .
Daniela responded to the many of their own buildings with which you do not come on right , so that the joint room comes out of the window , says : &quot; I do so seriously there@@ with . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger says definitely for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
you can see behind it a hidden sub@@ sid@@ y of reward or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area you give no compensation but get a real , in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speaking .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , the decision should be applied accordingly , finds three fears .
so , in two counter@@ acts of the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ises : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge hit to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

to get to star in the star of Stern
the first &quot; star cluster &quot; will be created in Har@@ z .
this is the club ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there are a plan of planning in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; come to meet the information needs of many har@@ nesses , the name of it was .
it connects nature , science , motion , and sporty performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route boards and inform them about stars and star pictures .
in the first phase to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire at St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets will be supplemented by Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
accessi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star Train to Ride is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewer tells a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , even though he was much more far away .
also , in which constellation can be found in a selected star and when it &apos;s best to see .
the club has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , which is the highest located in northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z counts according to information of the Federal Office for nature conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , from there are the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
in the University of the university , there have been something similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium of Göttingen since 2003 , like the planned star cluster - the planet Earth .
starting from the h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , that forms the interior of our solar system , the planet trail leads with its bars up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; alien &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of track ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ l@@ ected Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , the sun measures 70 centimeters .
the whole distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light of sun needs to be needed for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour until the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
but the march to the next fix@@ ture would take half a year .

four copies last tire plat@@ ters

two adults - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotary chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for a season open@@ er after 2 : 2 for the season open@@ er , that optimi@@ zing the removal of the immune formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , because there were not the two contra@@ sts at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two areas too much , and we must fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three chain will continue to be optimised in the Erz@@ gebirge .
and a fool after a fre@@ ash will no longer fall into the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew in preparation with the three chain is better than with the chain of the chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act as in Au@@ en , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we are just in the turning chain on the sem@@ ic@@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Fo@@ und@@ el@@ mann players who can build well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pre@@ condition , but we are still better and we don &apos;t aff@@ ord so many ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann has also de@@ parts to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot speak of a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the achievement could definitely be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we meet with four points on Sunday and we can concentrate on the cup , we will surely talk of a regular seasonal open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of them his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight playing days , Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be demolished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can begin the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann could even believe that the players from Au@@ e perhaps could possibly be fresh , since they could not have a heavy and full game like Fort@@ una against an asc@@ ension s@@ avo@@ red in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as it is 100 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests come from the Rhineland as a little favorite on Sunday into the encounter at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we are leaving them , only because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ en from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd division , which you have to strike by vor@@ n@@ in , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas chief coach .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
and so radio wants to see his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ evaluation tests Publ@@ ished
the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical jud@@ ging their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people were older than 18 years . however , not everyone believes to the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ ab@@ in@@ hal@@ e ) has started with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ Authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) were critic@@ ised for errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ min@@ ed .
until today , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6,@@ 880 was sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person &quot; could be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 , the conclusion was that the person &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable in the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see any big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has to be weighed over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases , the &quot; propose that the subject was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 published results , they noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in the x @-@ ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRI images , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later than usual by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the way of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way , it is very uns@@ afe .
if we could not say sure we should not do so as if we could happen , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ending the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of developing a child is in@@ correct as an adult .
the largest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is going well .
on Wednesday a seven tons has been installed on the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lo@@ cht , Construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the governing of the State of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at all three re@@ organisation needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the construction is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a rain@@ bow bridge from concrete that is dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the other two bridges also , she has come in the years now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to ensure stability and transport safety , three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ developed .
the other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 meters long respectively .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge portfolio on Wednesday morning .
this is a Rand@@ om fix@@ ion , which is also used as a operating way .
the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge .
then the pedestrian road is supposed to leave .
the special thing about it is that it concerns manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ forced .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips the structure of lines are required by the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there a glass fibre cable runs where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the projects in advance of the work .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ abled .
for bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ buildings and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is the traffic trace is regulated by one traffic light .
the construction work on the bridge at the Lu@@ ter@@ b@@ acher town entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ rist@@ s protest in German potato salad
it does not occur so often that parties draw near one strand , but if it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , comes together what else is difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag vul@@ can@@ ic parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that indicates that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ eng@@ in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites you to enter into a large electoral competition .
and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in the event before the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ Ds , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Br@@ unn@@ en@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ola - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ eng@@ o event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , is really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ g@@ German potato salad , who could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , pointing presence especially at the station , which is just a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D volcanic boots , he has been trying to make such an effort and get a surcharge .

both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have a solo@@ ist in European leaders .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people do gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is open to her bis@@ exual .
&apos;@@ Or once in gr@@ illed cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .

this really has really hurt me .

Virginia Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced today Thursday night with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifest@@ ation erup@@ ted in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say that it is at the time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won 42 points in West Virginia , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic can@@ did@@ acy of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is according to Forbes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes puts firmly that he has inher@@ ited hydro@@ carbon in five countries , and inher@@ ited from his father a hydro@@ carbon business .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ ot@@ ments and control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the final re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , consistent message , &quot; said R@@ NC president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ our@@ able &quot; Russian exc@@ use for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resumed in sports .
Russian athle@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ac@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the ban of his country was accurate and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) not@@ ices of state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e told the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself , that they have experienced some quite hot times and everything will do to ensure that the Federation will be redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think it was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gui@@ ding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dry system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing in the Track &amp; Field World Championships , which begin on Friday in London to compete in the strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
threat@@ ening tests are still in@@ sufficient and forbidden co@@ aches still operate , he said Rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tra@@ pe@@ as for Mali moved to Mali
in a fun@@ eral service at the north h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , approximately 1000 people have remembered the two soldiers with a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety arrangements .
to un@@ mist@@ ress , Secretary of Defense , Ursula , said nothing from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) .
they called the two commented pilots but as &quot; skill of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have earned in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

doubt about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not see : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of high significance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the S@@ är@@ ge was brought from the cathedral .

Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his death next to his wife .
that divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish Royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen has agreed with the decision of her husband , it was continued in the release .
where Prince Hen@@ rik be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to join in his French country .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a H@@ ehl , that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have been king .
he retired from retirement in 2016 and also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not see the title and the function whom he wanted to see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chef of the Danish king house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will be , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to join in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his future wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always attributed the sympath@@ ies in his close to 50 years , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand for the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ises .
my Danish was pregnant , I prefer wine , instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ om , which I smoke instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco , and the conclusion that the call had to be a brand of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope in the sight .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
they were like two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ expert &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government multip@@ licity for a rapid re @-@ selection of the country , but he does not want to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he talked to the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs from their Parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their kno@@ ck An @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ail set up their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hannover .
CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend it to its faction .
this means that the CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green seats .
so far the ratio was vice versa .
the new Parliament will be voted on 14th January next year .
Th@@ ose said the red @-@ green state government has to decide if they could continue to reg@@ ain in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , is for indispens@@ able that the country &apos;s day quickly decides its own self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on her further notice on Tuesday .
the Swiss Federal Constitution also stipul@@ ates that the Parliament &apos;s parliament cho@@ oses trust the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be legally cleaned , &quot; said Th@@ ick@@ ler .
&quot; you will cause all the questions in peace when it is legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ick@@ ler called T@@ uss &apos;s pace &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the political scientist said : &quot; I &apos;m not a judge .
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Green Party demanded the ab@@ dic@@ ed dep@@ uties for the return of its land@@ lord .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course that she received her Land@@ tag@@ n@@ at that she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed by the state presi@@ ding met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consci@@ ously decided to lead no exc@@ use in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no differences of differences , we cannot draw this step forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD law candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Over@@ coming of the Lower Saxony @-@ uties El@@ ke T@@ ent to the CDU as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the voters and voters , but also the Council of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef on Friday on Facebook .
he under@@ stands the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ choose the Parliament .
the Austr@@ o @-@ green inside was the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised their personal interests in its mis@@ ery and fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crit@@ ici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ ius and tries to beat out the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ obj@@ s@@ ens CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties , El@@ ke T@@ life@@ in the CDU .
the Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the life@@ jack@@ ets , gave the result of the 2013 Parliament election as a result of the election .
the CDU was then in front of the SPD its strongest force , SPD and green spaces in the Parliament but a thin majority of one voice .
agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about mut@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect the consumer .
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protection from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer goods and consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and review the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German states present the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if we are aware of what we are aware , a health hazard is not excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately increased immediately , and since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s parties in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the makers to ensure that the products of traffic light and health are un@@ think@@ able .
if the resi@@ dues of the back level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , this is not capable of traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time does not have to bl@@ ame for the work .
sitting production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the ze@@ able license , the production plants meets the immediate gu@@ ilt .
rather , they have to calculate with economic damage due to mut@@ ually illegal practices .
as always there is too little checking in the harvest .
is it only missing on the personnel or at the fl@@ aming jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , the truth is , however , that food and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
therefore , there are a consequ@@ ent ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such things , and hand@@ ing over to the government agencies in the cases where off@@ ences are proposed , of decisive importance .
I have already made multiple permission from the responsible authorities , I expect a li@@ qu@@ en@@ sel@@ ess En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
is the regular alarm mixing at food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and traffic @-@ enabled food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer goods and consumers are righ@@ ted right .
by means of the contrac@@ ted funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have gu@@ essed in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pr@@ on@@ il is not acceptable for the attitude of life @-@ feeding animals and must immediately termin@@ ate immediately .
it has to be consistently working on all levels and working with high pressure .
I expect from any competent authorities that the atomic fact is ra@@ dically resolved and lo@@ osed .
how the rules of foot@@ ball to go to Paris on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ easy issues of European football clubs , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not distur@@ bing .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEFA yet , as the leading organization , who monitored the European game , has power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules that were launched by the UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G must point out at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to acquire the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can loose food with safety , that N@@ ey@@ mar sign up and bring him into a galaxy of other stars in view of the financing of the team through the ener@@ ge@@ ous royal family of Qatar .
clubs may apply to the acquisition of players a lot of money , but need to reci@@ pro@@ claim with legitim@@ ate income streams , which enable them to enable the break @-@ even point in her in the football @-@ related business .
Mr. Michel Plat@@ ini was conceived in 2007 by Michel Plat@@ ini .
the former French player believed that publ@@ ishers had enormous debt in their journeys to the success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked up when banks or owners re@@ trac@@ ed their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P reli@@ ed from concentration on the debt of the clubs on monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model used the novel Ab@@ r@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the team and to establish a global brand - to a har@@ der matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P distribution period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may accept losses of 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to ref@@ resh themselves from out@@ fit issues .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite the Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package deal , it may distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five year contract , so that the amount of redemption for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has reached the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams of teams for the Champions League will be held in 2014 / 15 to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to over@@ get its financial support by companies associated with owners of a clubs , which are associated with owners of a clubs .
while a cat@@ ar@@ tic company sponsor PS@@ G could be sponsor , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not suffer it as a legitim@@ acy .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the PSA by the Qatar @-@ Authority was found .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via the Pay@@ ments Committee of the World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argu@@ ed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ ass@@ adors will be simply trying to find out a der@@ ive maneu@@ vers for the UEFA Reg@@ ulator authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA still att@@ entive to see any attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ preparing talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announc@@ ing the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked to the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not discus@@ sing the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association proceeds from the fact that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was definitely irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s route by saying that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear@@ er case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the official owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many candidates are available at the new announcement , the Swiss will not be betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming in question .
according to the newspaper report Ch@@ oc@@ ol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to pursue a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer did not reach an opinion .
chocolate bars distributed the Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .

this repet@@ ition of history is nost@@ al@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge @-@ era ( as the Vor@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age ) , and for yourself - that is , for 2001 , before her stars such as Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to major things .
as an cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would fall short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absur@@ d Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original history for a speaking box vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by taking on the core of the G@@ ags - Ac@@ tor middle age play rop@@ es of children who grow up - they still create the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; with his parents who now play adults is less emotional and his par@@ ody goes out more after the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
one point is a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and a series of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the favorite C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ tic@@ or , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite More@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ ility .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious plot that is involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the extra courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d to see the Matt D@@ illons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &apos; singles , &quot; whose former big one @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is getting married as an old ch@@ acker .
there are the moments of random mad@@ ness to heat this fran@@ chise like a sort of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; the last scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Detective &quot; on Amazon has now rec@@ alls a different kind of nost@@ al@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West ring fight @-@ icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy filmed by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as a director . Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , strug@@ gling for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main wheels - a hard @-@ shot Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ ogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice pictures regarding the reputation ( the police takes the time to watch chess in television , as Americans may possibly do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ om Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a cont@@ ingent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Detective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda dram@@ as - a rob@@ bers who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved , that it often plays as a single one .
with six episodes episodes , the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Detective , &quot; which was placed on a lower length , could not deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p s@@ ati@@ re , as Gregor und I@@ os@@ ef once again visited the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who swal@@ low up a bun@@ ch of Hamburg .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that the Western culture can do all for food for a money .
the fic@@ tional Romanian creator had not been false : we even make it with our own younger history and with the er@@ ron@@ eous .
blow to drugs @-@ m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart were looking for numerous objects , as the Public Prosec@@ ution in Constance took place on Friday .
there were 15 accused at the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and issued warran@@ ts against this arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials ordered greater amounts of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects of the Itali@@ ans .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
over 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the members of the Mafia is organised drug criminal , severe violent actions , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and stress .
in summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Konstan@@ z were established in the South German area .
between the government agencies in Konstan@@ z and Palermo a re@@ productive exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the vis@@ or of the investigations , mainly Italian nationals with regard to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident on the 27th of May in hat@@ ch , several shots were fired into a restaurant at the early morning , is likely to go to the Ban@@ de account .
way be@@ mo@@ t big g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner stops
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner stops in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved mal@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es in the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , developed attention to a media report according to a media report that att@@ enti@@ vely attention to large g@@ aps .
the def@@ ici@@ encies of the registered data may be carried out in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; in an analysis in an analysis based on the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the register , 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 exclusion agencies in Germany .
since the data has not been maintained enough , the data quality in parts has not been well done so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ective data sets can significantly slow@@ ing back processes , &quot; says the report .
in statistics of out @-@ travelling people over the EU citizens are cap@@ tures , those who don &apos;t need to travel .
but such false regulations resulted in a de@@ ath@@ ed debate on the dealing with trav@@ eler fol@@ ly , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy again when they traveled from there .
that go out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New Apostolic &quot; newspaper . &quot;
in the paper it is therefore , the B@@ AM@@ F , such procedures , concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants , according to Italy since June 1 , 2017 again . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer was possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation in the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office is therefore write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have submitted Italy for the admission and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold this comm@@ it@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU states also would send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
the internal affairs of the ruler of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are thre@@ aten due to the def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system human asylum application and a endanger@@ ment of the child . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from the Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons provided blood flow service already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens , who have been awarded on Friday .
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shared about 50 litres of blood in the meantime .
traditionally , the church recogni@@ zes the multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is gen@@ ius as our body is laid for it , and we will give the sp@@ ies that you have the blood of strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ key helps several people , explained the Kreis@@ ation of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger ma@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are broken into their components .
by this way , three individuals could benefit from a blood don@@ key .
at the same time , ma@@ ize reports reported by the actions that were carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , with 114 don@@ ors , we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circuit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously I have led to the the@@ atri@@ cal house a few years ago at higher number of participants .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Reich@@ ck , Sandra Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ bre@@ berry , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ bre@@ berry to the multiple don@@ ors have been awarded for 50 performances .

the Bank of England will hold the interest rate at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations should be d@@ amp@@ ened over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain , when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a increasing pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members of an increase in this month , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 that pressure should continue on the household income , whereas inflation in fall is expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they signals that in the coming years zinc deficiency would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the lending cost might be more than expected to reach the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut economy package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide funding from the upcoming February cheaper financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is now expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - at 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the rate of interest , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to use consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain penalty of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets is currently expanding the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank also stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards corrected growth forecasts for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1,7 % reported in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have risen to rise expectations and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter although it is easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by increasing inflation and minor salary cuts , because the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first be worse before it will be better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years can &apos;t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that the wages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was considerably worse at the end of their three year &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy will also be strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision comes to a year following the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU consultation which caused the sin@@ king of a friend .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy .
prior to the last decision of the Bank to the interest rates the call had increased after an interest rate , since the inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July increased to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to wear it again in the next few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that its aims at a ratio of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent re@@ location of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should again be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking for shops and would like to finish the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those who exclu@@ de the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low yields are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to prop@@ ag@@ ate HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV preventive care treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse , pre@@ ach@@ able phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk rates by around 86 percent , now comes from health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the process after the Appeals Court confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court , according to which the N@@ HS had confirmed the authority for the Pr@@ EP , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
the chess suit announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens , as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be part of the first , which will enable the application of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ emin@@ ent phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV treatment that can be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduced the HIV transmission in risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medic@@ ations in the body are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medic@@ ations can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are interested in question are of gay or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ss@@ exual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants identified , which agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ formers and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered at a medical specialist can also register for a possible participation in their local stakeh@@ older clinic .
the program will be signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week after an international competitive production .
the study should be evaluated the whole potential of Pr@@ EP by evalu@@ ating clinical trials , which is applied specifically and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV and over@@ take .
it is a further milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in preser@@ ving one of the major health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive on NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if specifically tailored to needy and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV @-@ epidemic .
from September to people , people will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improving many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be found that the study will soon be held throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV .
now because the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine was designed , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow and Minister of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and delay .
the evidence show how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in the company one step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever Designer tricks have changed this little Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank player with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I looked after something that was comparable to my prize .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have done myself in love and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a missing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to get Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she instructed the Architecture and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to make the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other , so the architectural challenge in it was able to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the pre@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stri@@ pped of each other without having to g@@ aps to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just a simple platform to build a simple platform , but the steel that he had the correct height at the top or bottom . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place Er@@ fan , placing two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ red units offer space for all stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
hing@@ ed kitchens are not new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the reinforced reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mut@@ ually important so that when you push the door , it is very easy to guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of room and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials which provides space to its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are things that you touch and the others help to create an emotional binary in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not love you in the electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed into a good design and increased square footage of slightly different standard , which can be transformed into something very discre@@ et .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brothers compete for a 500 million US dollars in the real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation on one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ an worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this one brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and their business can be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ frontation about the separation finds in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , since the family has purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , since 1973 .
there , the family of Western co Je@@ ans founded and grew to a chain of 160 unique shops .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Colin is described as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third .
it says that Colin property has valued at $ 316 million , and Paul has valued at $ 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved himself for Paul as a reference point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colin proposed sub@@ divisions have left him with what I stayed for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed meetings .
the brothers also strug@@ gling for control over the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to have him excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed this is not true , but raises Paul ahead of managing some owners .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that he was filed by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian Heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading legal forests , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides obtained law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy farm and delic@@ acy shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s a shop bought in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
it uses security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Colin the first Je@@ ans@@ shop of the family .
Colin says that he started in West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their property to pass her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is company group , whereby Colin claims that mark on leaving the company had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
as well as Mark , Paul says , &quot; Paul &quot; has made bitter opinion about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made herself very rec@@ alled , though he was a former AF@@ L member , and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media received Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin made by text to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the fall is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain and to compl@@ ain our family name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t desire that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; Colin wrote .

here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , he met his first work in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wanted to repair : bad information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ it@@ ry diagnosis makes sense , but others have attempted to tell a dump by controlling his media control .
the president Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship lasts for many decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ isions is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was off@@ ended because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom consists of control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption has a ste@@ ady lob@@ b@@ price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever was &quot; under control , &quot; is ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
perhaps these Kamp@@ agn@@ ers know something that we do not know , that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets have still contained more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably learn anything about the twe@@ ets , the tr@@ ump is not sent .
if his staff had already managed to hold a few times , trouble from him , then their effort was worth it .
but nobody knew it consistently that Tr@@ ump is calling out tro@@ phy .
a part of the problem exists that people in a white house that con@@ ven@@ es itself from competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump materials , which may improve their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported more information about the pre@@ ference of consultants , president of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former j@@ ump officials said that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press clips , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will find out how these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February , when somebody was willing to cast a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster to be of his ch@@ equ@@ es &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson became ex@@ iled from Twitter , or that he has not offered a concrete evidence , or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and contradic@@ ts it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to in@@ quire at the staff of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that then Chief of Staff of Chief of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; attempted to implement a system to control the paper , and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still in influence .
this un@@ changeable factors make the wa@@ ys mission very difficult .
masters of bur@@ gl@@ ar get mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hopes .
the police in all of Europe ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
as the addresses of fine cr@@ ush@@ ers are not known in accordance with regard to science , references from the population hopes to inv@@ ent and pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Day of Europe reported on Friday the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience could have shown that many vol@@ at@@ ile connections are stopped , it was called Europ@@ ol .
there have been 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ell website has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online fac@@ tions were arrested so far , at least eleven of them depending on the publication of the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the we@@ al@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands have returned with some escape trav@@ ellers on war@@ ks that have been negotiated by the church in order to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their homes .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transport , after they have been cast out only in May , without any gra@@ bs out by the Council , to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense , and pressed their vehicles by a section which remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way .
the inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they have cast stones to the Pass@@ anten .
the Council must be forced by hanging on the implementation in fact since it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were moved in May there and are now back again .
more came last night , probably still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long sub@@ missions to protect your parks .
I live at the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my collective tax when the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
a resident who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous that we have just seen the last round of this travelers to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have increased this time , and even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
an spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and working with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible .
to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior on the police by calling 101 by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check if we propose our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ bach is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ance of the company mbH on April 13th , 2014 went around 30 000 nights per year and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic numbers of refugees that came into the County , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat@@ ec house as a collection of accommodation proposed for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the area of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
however , in particular , the Lord Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and spoke already at that time already by serious people interested in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ y with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and will make it back to a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter Property .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof stood before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovation works will be carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to the part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs away from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area will be redesigned and new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; to be close to &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room include the equipment .
it would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but pointed to a higher @-@ scale center of the city .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would represent a broad range of be@@ ers .
both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business professionals are supposed to feel at the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city cover the same with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to be exactly determined .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
external machines are also brought to fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special tractor sets out the jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have deployed a so @-@ called grand jury following a report .
the Panel included the work last weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation against the contract .
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CNN reported that there are already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have committed himself to the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether they were talking between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are expected to take place in the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ ner Tr@@ ump personally had moved into the centre and under@@ score the alleg@@ ations of whether the president could possibly disabled the justice .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to test this evidence in possible sus@@ pic@@ ion and decide whether it shall be charged .
Grand jury will therefore also refer to count chambers .
mostly they are switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to re@@ charge people under E@@ id .
according to the CNN &apos;s station , these charges were exhibited , which around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
you should also prepare documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging electoral head Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
law experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the goal show that Mu@@ eller should not be sh@@ in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not be forced to decide that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the introduction of the committee on the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in one position , he knew nothing of the introduction of a Grand Jury .
however , this work as well as usually in the en@@ ger@@ ms , he stressed .
the White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of the special society on &quot; fair &quot; manner .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the President .
you have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was stated in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
because of this incident , alleg@@ ations were made against Tr@@ ump , he w@@ aged the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
in June , Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him a setting of the investigation against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to the US media depic@@ ts the White House material against the special communication and its staff .
that triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent special artist of Congress , such as at the Water@@ gate affair about the later rec@@ alled president Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller could have fired a position in which he could have fired in theory at the in@@ justice of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators ordered the bill of bills on Thursday , after which the Sonder@@ komm@@ ando could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Arctic , an enormous ice@@ berg from the scar@@ cely ven@@ fold size of Berlin is resolved .
this was divided by the Alfred Weg@@ ener Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
that over a trillion ton weight and 5@@ 800 square kilometers of big Kol@@ oss t@@ oss to North and become probably two , three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest iron giant , which researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research information .
however , there have been a series of unusual mer@@ ging in the region for about 30 years , the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor of fact .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the broken col@@ t has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ov .
sh@@ y flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ov is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
in the north of this line the balance of wax and demol@@ ition was distur@@ bed several years ago .
a complete ch@@ avi@@ est is there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ty is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under voltage and can be dis@@ rup@@ ted , if you break a piece in one of the key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ ong@@ s and Eis@@ berg will not increase the sea level because they swim on the water and po@@ ets the ice as much water as it yields itself after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the scra@@ p leads to the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level , but only in a small dimensions , the British research project is writes the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ engine is the fourth biggest sho@@ el@@ ance of Antar@@ c@@ tica according to the AW@@ I data collection with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it dis@@ rup@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; though it is a natural thing , and is not aware of direct connection to climate change , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
scientists should be disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ov may grow again or go back in the long term , and possibly together , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even though this researchers have not dis@@ rup@@ ted the ab@@ rupt@@ cy of this gigantic Eis@@ berg to climate change , so in the past few decades , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart from the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
this long p@@ oo@@ rest of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic research programme , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has contributed .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have gone up around three degrees in the past 50 years , thus reaching the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU : pet tariff at the personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy freely @-@ ending places , the CDU , from the workers &quot; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has crossed 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 applications were expected to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lack staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks .
currently there are currently 50 jobs in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
they are sought by doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG who would take the initiative and comm@@ enting the conference in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration will work according to the desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a concept for personal development and personal development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to un@@ cover short @-@ term necess@@ ities to professionals , but future @-@ oriented approach to the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should be ori@@ enting on the inside and extern@@ ally , concrete measures for cross @-@ drop@@ outs represent and an exempl@@ ary offensive , require CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this already sounds a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems , which one knew not so far .
other cities advert@@ ise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age can be put out of the service .
highest time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CDU , comes with his party even beyond the joint application .
he had already been a surprise in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ ain@@ ting thick surprise when he posed the personnel cover publicly in question and dis@@ gu@@ sted the other parties .
people would like to check out all the possibilities , which allow a withdrawal from the communal employer association .
&quot; if we do not want to meet a satisfactory solution here , the county administration should stri@@ ve with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the streets of the cities - a pet @-@ tariff , &quot; so people .
therefore , the CDU , employees and officials will be better to pay better than the tari@@ ffs for public service .
sal@@ aries are currently no required , enh@@ ancements or more money there is only if one changes in higher levels that are orient@@ ated to vocational years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute Protection Act .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO migrants life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has used NGOs that use the lif@@ ters for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ns that they do not continue to continue with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign any new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ aking &apos; because their team had collabor@@ ating effectively with traff@@ ickers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself in detailed pre@@ judi@@ ces of the Italian government Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we &apos;re very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a position to social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge any alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected , after we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ aked &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , supervised in October .
it is thought that his crew will take pipe din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly by traff@@ ickers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used to use the ships again .
at least one such meetings allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acc@@ es of the citizenship , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation will be suspected of taking over the authority of Italian coastal weakness , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ ves are monitored .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have aboard an Italian police officers who monitors their activities .
just three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far proclaimed to keep up in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but un@@ acceptable , as they would not have &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate Organization ( Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is awarded .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants lost after the rescue service in Italy , had strongly declined during the last weeks , that efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month for economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
Go@@ at and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the Berlin Sec@@ tors &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the north @-@ Palat@@ inate to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly Gu@@ ides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Castle and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the p@@ inn@@ acle of the forest and the advanced levels .
in between there was always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for Sal@@ ine and the folk festival market .
back to the view@@ point at the view@@ point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days there were many al@@ timeter .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and h@@ uts , welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker maintained the bi@@ li@@ ft@@ in@@ hal@@ atorium healing Sole .
Neustadt has also been controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 al@@ timeter , the group had the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural - learned to know .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equipment for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future because of computer games , rather than swe@@ ating in wind and weather about the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport is long since become a growing branch , become an air@@ y business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
this also recognized the first federal government to engage in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolf@@ sburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport unit in mid @-@ July and recorded two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to insp@@ ire a completely new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Trade Association organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup to compete against the Gam@@ ers of various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolf@@ sburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven quali@@ fies .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen acquired a agency for virtual football players in the meantime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football club has to settle in particular with the 14 to 30 year old that young people go to the stadium again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the temp@@ ting , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with celebr@@ ities E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men , one could be present online far more often in these markets than once in the year AD the federal state of Asia .
what is it all about ?
at the E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA will be on competition at competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
for many , the performance of the performance need to be used .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ otic has long been dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions , which you can also find in classical sports , for example , increased cardi@@ ac frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive capabilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ otic see also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a subject . &quot;
checks are difficult in online games hard @-@ run , and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integ@@ rative effect of the e @-@ sport .
players are international on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no intercultural in@@ cess@@ es .
a study by corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover should be 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , &quot; E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the established sports such as Hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ant .
International reports to many countries .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ sports competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot happened in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport as a class@@ room has been introduced , F@@ rob@@ otic says .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first @-@ League raff@@ les are obliged to establish an e @-@ sports section according to D@@ utt .
&quot; in the European comparison Germany in Germany , V@@ f@@ B executive board is explained by R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall into nost@@ al@@ gia , and to clari@@ fy the ancient times , is no longer enough .

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy sentenced him to suicide ,
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encour@@ ages her boy@@ friend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their convic@@ tion behind guitar@@ ists and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
he was sentenced to death in June for hom@@ osexual acts of Conrad Roy who died on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy told her on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ted .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed him to stay free .
it was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter arose with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down upon straigh@@ tened eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; her actions have been Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State attor@@ ney in the Tribunal .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility &quot; said she said .
&quot; she has no repentance . &quot;
but Car@@ ters did attor@@ ney , it is a &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that she completely regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spiritual disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
an attor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; not a day when I pray not the loss of my beloved son .
I want to be proud of me , and as I go with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; said it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will never be persecuted by the knowledge , &quot; that they will never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or would be a t@@ ante for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this one person , with whom I was in order every day since my birth , a pain , whom I will keep for my life forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , there seems to be a lawful preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s text releases , having encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on the spring of a building , for yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , and &quot; Every@@ thing that you must do is the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter searched attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from some press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
on the few , the Carter defended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was condemned in 2007 because of murder of their British ro@@ omm@@ ates in Italy before she was acquitted of two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment at Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was able to run at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern st@@ owed the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a large season - Extra motivation will not leave .
anything else in its place in the cabin , that looked Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra clothing was very small , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups of course no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel New had been trying to see , he hur@@ ried to him that hur@@ ried to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach was not announced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good that could have better run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also indicate that .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was in the group of youth players who chose de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the vac@@ ant professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide .
su@@ gar@@ s can be distributed to those who want to have a lot of those who want to hold on your mood .
if so , anyone who explo@@ res the inheritance of L@@ ame , a small extra motivation can only use good motivation .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to act as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old made a mini @-@ L@@ ame over the field .
on the right side , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de in the arm and its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start information such as the one who can take the ru@@ d@@ der best into the hand .
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal makes his missing fitness to over@@ play ( folding hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil , come out to the benefits of Asia trip ( it was also condition@@ ally condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to move not negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked quite well .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran off the defense , both ag@@ itated superior .
the nam@@ ing Nap@@ oli of Nap@@ oli was very difficult , in addition , sweet@@ le tried for a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y pointed to that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not that was , as we hopes for ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
playing time , speed change : &quot; for this style I was taken too . &quot;
as usual , this Bayern world still looked for the new access , one looked after the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting set : &quot; what here goes , I have already noticed .
you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , this does not have to contribute to the new one more .

company pleased with Rheinland @-@ pf@@ el@@ z@@ stic minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able , the relationship between the country and regional economy as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows more than one year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V inquiry of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing att@@ ends the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all of them . &quot;
the largest swe@@ eping thing is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ ing- exclusion of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is located in the pri@@ or@@ atory list of the country now on top of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is intended to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ber@@ nation Trier , which is on the pre@@ defined demand of the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the aim is to take into operation the distance in December 2020 , says Foreign Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to sust@@ ain regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aiming at the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales growth in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish a private company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the wine Chamber of Trier looks in the new Master Bonus an additional inc@@ entive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the awarded Master testing and 2500 euros , if graduates have been carried out independently after ten years after their master@@ y .
but the hom@@ e@@ work @-@ list for the country remains long .
the planned road building will be able to create rapidly facts , at the same time it failed to land on the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , the Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust bis@@ sing in the country operation , are only 29 jobs .
the Chamber is required to assign more jobs to external offices .
CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Au@@ d@@ itors , the country investing more than € 20 million less in receipt of country roads as proposed in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept as it wants to fix the specialist in the region .
it was also the old broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ten internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of the policy and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ on for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already hosted the field after four months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi will change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers con@@ fron@@ ts with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinion is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as a travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - among them Munich where BMW is resident - to restri@@ ct or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there are three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
one of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ its diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asth@@ ma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems to neutr@@ alize the gas emissions from diesel vehicles to install , take also what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the mighty car companies and signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the bugs of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called laun@@ cher equipment that have been tested in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but under normal conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused of developing a system to circum@@ vent the emissions of emissions in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be heavy @-@ loaded : the luxury car manufacturer carries over propor@@ tion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los cre@@ ases and the laughter against sorrow
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most scre@@ ed carto@@ ons , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ant of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ inian still works and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
he was among others in the first years as an artist for happiness tickets - what was fru@@ str@@ ated by him .
&quot; the most lucky day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
again , the artist inspired him to insp@@ ire .
great , rund@@ own Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures are located in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he is still working on the drawing day , working almost ten hours daily .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches find its d@@ rol@@ ing figures still much spreading worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main person at the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ ly popular animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ ing of a thousand .
the figures for the first time speak in the 3D movie which is expected to be back to the@@ atri@@ cal wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script will not be written by him .
that is why he &apos;s more on the TV series , which , as its original records , why it is produced .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is decre@@ asing because of the conditions of d@@ rought and because of the in@@ firm@@ ities of insects , in which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions that are trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed in the impact of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and in the fall much more .
this has imp@@ lications for the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf , and at very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s much in the game .
lav@@ ender oil sp@@ ells not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE , and either missing or damaged .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the sprinkl@@ ing plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry resistant .

the assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ esdays , to examine their plans for the reporting of the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa through the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ stopp@@ able drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss which feel saf@@ er : they are supposed to take their children with the office which were the aim of an attack with gran@@ ules , or let them go home in 2009 .
security experts have three words written on a board at the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ ale , allies .
you ask the repor@@ ter , name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal feelings .
there are drug mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand at the bottom of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest from violence , and during all the country the bodies are frequent , there are always more journalists : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under threat and thre@@ ats under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is the editor and its In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake it is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is deeply felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which depends on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two Rep@@ orter in the thirty years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts that will show his ri@@ dic@@ ulous face with ey@@ e@@ wear or typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ter discuss their divided topics , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , a son@@ g@@ ney General was established to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists just two criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of murder , which are linked to drug traff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ted and even though the terrain is now even more ambitious .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meetings for discussion of security has little advantage , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stup@@ id that time to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the Why , mis@@ erable we all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was gone away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing about the subject of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans , last year and the extradition of the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa became one of the country &apos;s most blo@@ o@@ dies@@ els in the country , where ri@@ v@@ alis@@ ing frac@@ tions were strug@@ gling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa any day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of galvan@@ ized , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug might who are larger than many houses for the Living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; when only a cart@@ el takes control over the coastal governmental with its valuable ports and drugs @-@ trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ stand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ v@@ alis@@ ing cart@@ ons in war with gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication might have expired the sons , the Gang@@ ed members purchased each copy of the issue , as soon as they had delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was in that Val@@ dez was not forced to force Val@@ dez , after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a landmark in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long , that his friends and colleagues said he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the company with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without em@@ ming journ@@ alism , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it , hard tre@@ ad examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could deal with anything else .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , where they always led them .
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J @-@ Award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in October last October .
&quot; you need to take the task of taking over to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do about that of many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a harbour worker , who was a friend , gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and coun@@ ters , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office and there is always sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also has comp@@ elled them to question their own statements about it in question , how to do their work on the best , and keep alive in the life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their young businesses , their home start and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self maintenance .
trust his own Inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , lead away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; od@@ our a sense that can be mo@@ cked ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others , are no longer valid in Sin@@ al@@ oa , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other countries where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling rou@@ bles , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the scenery changed constantly .
in the room where the staff met from Ri@@ odo@@ ce for security training , there were suddenly no cell@@ phones allowed . days previously announced that Spyware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
there are two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , some of the Rep@@ orter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , which the governor itself did not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug bound de facto are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spent on three main stories .
it was the assassination of the former renowned Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é for the state spending which focused on the home town of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souvenir from the office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug hands and authorities .
a repor@@ ter knew from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Politi@@ ker , who ruled the reg@@ aining Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled almost the whole century all the political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ cali@@ bre events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked Rep@@ orter to write about previous events in this locality , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , the readers would have watched the column of Val@@ dez as the best inform@@ al source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its stream@@ lined body muscles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage space for signs and st@@ ickers , dedicated to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have never expected something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in all the country , journalists have become stronger , having written &quot; SOS Press &quot; organized in organized protests .
this day director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez lam@@ inated the authorities to op@@ press journalists and to re@@ inst@@ ate them because they said the truth .
she has been asked since that she is separated from the government because she is concerned that her rage has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes committed to the government officials and a Gender Equality Society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on orders of policies and security forces , which are committed by a organized crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they are sure that you hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a horri@@ fying effect .
no one gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as at the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the z@@ qu@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were beside her separate head .
some stores have chosen to close how the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their direct in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed to the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are h@@ unted , as it appears in the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico city was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue back and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ em@@ o@@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet , is that the drug traff@@ icking are troubled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I became a repor@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat down on the mayor in front of the office and drank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ mon@@ y .
a series of sh@@ en@@ ig@@ ans with band@@ en@@ ri@@ v@@ alen and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had left the dead in 19 .
the war was further promised , as promised by a number of Kart@@ ell Em@@ bassies in the region .
from the board of the board they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens hi@@ ves close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez has a look at the polic@@ emen who held the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid of all , they did not show it .
under the powerful portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper , whose center finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ al@@ oa , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day was assassin@@ ated , intern@@ ship was assassin@@ ated , the practition@@ ers asked me to send them on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so good , that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his sli@@ pp@@ age was caught by red@@ dish Braun - and they said they had had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; named him as &quot; the best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever been found , and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ rs which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ kept state has researchers that describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the fertili@@ zed plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , in March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed to be seen from the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ yp@@ h , and decided to look more accurately .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground attack .
after all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blind only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creation is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one of the most beautiful and best preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa is the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and res@@ embles a convertible shell , probably threatened by flesh and din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily pat@@ ched din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from pir@@ ate , and used a barn technique which is known as counter@@ att@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ rs has been making head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have studied the wild animal and has called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the form of sheds and arm@@ or on his body .
they discovered the conversation , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than her under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising when the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta significantly exceeds the living animals today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of sufficient pressure by meat @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs according to the evolution of the con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the connectivity - do you think about R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or g@@ ird animals - are much smaller and injury than prey , which signals that this cam@@ dos@@ sier was exposed to a real fight .
&quot; strong smoke @-@ tier behavior on a massive , strong red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ aring @-@ animals of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous must have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was rot@@ ated .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics about his life , including his con@@ ven@@ ings , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and fell into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta were as warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal is ret@@ ains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as exactly as in the early delivery period .
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes sh@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period was a period of time , as huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs , the earth went through .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the mo@@ red Din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
it belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
scientists who appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has failed after the death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Radio , when he was in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , in March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the sn@@ out to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed down to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ eled vegetable ore was damaged by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded in the open sea .
but the under@@ water of the din@@ osau@@ rs preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the stone remains of this special single specimen are so good that the skin still runs woo@@ fers with b@@ oul@@ ders along the din@@ osau@@ rs .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , it &apos;s such a level of conservation as &apos; sel@@ dom like a win in lot@@ tery .
the more I arrive , the more pu@@ zz@@ iness there will be .
the skin remains conce@@ aled from the skin still cover the woo@@ dy tank circuit that wear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread up .
I can count the sheds on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : bulk spro@@ cket on A8 : many injured
sharp accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass of mass bol@@ ster .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long dum@@ b - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the late afternoon of the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured in the late afternoon of Thursday .
according to the first information of the police , at 17.00 hr@@ s. between the provinces of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles including lor@@ ries , inter@@ sec@@ ted .
over the exact number of injuries initially does not contain any data .
there are a slight to moderate serious injuries , a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ ers said .
a large lif@@ esp@@ an of life@@ vehicles had been at the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
in the direction of direction of Munich , some ten kilometres long ago came back .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it came also on the counter@@ way to massive disabilities - by numerous don@@ ors .
the fire brig@@ ade listed the label of the vehicle , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive offen@@ ders .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
in this process there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : company test@@ ers &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has experienced almost every time : nothing sits on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ aved or ri@@ ps the g@@ rope in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of inter@@ ruption are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing automated driving control .
it simply confirms the phone that the card is taken and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we extend it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; call the train box classification without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to utili@@ ze the use , however , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - what you can do in most passengers already .
it also has to be bought via the app for the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way in the ticket office .
and most recently you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : one rises in the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
with the test customers a button on electronic stand@@ ings appears .
the train att@@ endant has a message to their mobile devices a message that Pass@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seating area Y .
when the pull @-@ seat control comes to square Y he knows that a passenger is placed in a very valuable online ticket .
so , we can continue to keep on working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - what would like to use passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; those who wish to travel without ticket check through our train stations would like to check out the DB navig@@ ator just yourself .
this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB district traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than to go to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who drives you often , know that beside del@@ ays and pas@@ est trains , the chassis checks are among the largest sleeves as well .
for often , in any case one of the participants do not need any documents , which you need to pay online tickets for the evaluation of online tickets .
either the credit card or number of personal credit or identity card or a document must be presented .
the consequence are endless discussions between mig@@ rating managers and driving g@@ assed , which leads to poor atmosphere in the part or large room and del@@ ays with the control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time to take care of others .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund University Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further access numbers on the same distance are not un@@ locked .
how a activists came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken at its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the one sat in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ens on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and there is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used , since nobody had posted the information on her feed , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live too twe@@ ets .
he post@@ ulated a painting of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was not new for her and her community .
she made her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be brow@@ ns his father , who contributed a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ hop dog .
in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman sh@@ out his sh@@ ot@@ gun , and he cried , &quot; I will kill you ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alls their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt sh@@ ook .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked an excursion and went home next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two on the next morning would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ants , love and loss of resistance , the strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a floral dress and a suitable crown , brought the two a conversation , which they had numerous occasions in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remin@@ ded about what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it needs to know and see it and be taken in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her a experience in which they personally experienced no matter of rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to hold them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police department , which became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with local partners , the lunch did .
they prepared pockets before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly I began to accept a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m totally changed after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ se Association was concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to record or try to find a story which you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism has been nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
how Fol@@ ay@@ an declared recently in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to make it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around the death of death .
his dedication to Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together with six other loc@@ als the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; over the years of Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ til@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Christian leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain simil@@ arity at this work and in case of human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history is repeated the role of black break@@ ers women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founder of the movement , which according to the killing of the black Teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ by Martin &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media identify themselves than gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we fight on various fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an antibiot@@ ic type of action , &quot; by Fer@@ rell &apos;s heart to be selected as heart of the movie .
&quot; she was the person that sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no co@@ incidence , although it was at the front front because of a life in these clo@@ cks as a black , s@@ ule woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news @-@ eras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has long been gone , but the r@@ ass@@ ical connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking with a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ olit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless they d@@ anced for singing and she herself committed to this memory , ever since she went to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and assist .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for long .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone p@@ ens the population in Be@@ et@@ wor@@ ter and opponent in 2009 .
it &apos;s hard to get the theme .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
while they say to a bit gallery : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; that would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ mann ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or quite simply : &quot; magn@@ itudes ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the Be@@ et@@ ters indicates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which the other businesses should benefit from fear the opponents that then bl@@ aze the pedestrian zone .
in addition , the gallery is planned to be exactly on the premises in which the peas@@ ant market stands , in which 13 direct market will provide their products .
with the beginning of the construction work , there will be the end .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely to the Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost every week in the peas@@ ant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the gins always liked again .
we have discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like that even while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is that .
especially the small mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery , come to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should probably not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the buying ship in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ e- or supermarkets : I think it is su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough space in our city .
you can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not yet another ordinary weekly market , it is all more important that at least you will receive the market hall at least .
because after all , the product offered there is fresh , is largely offered by producers and is ob@@ end@@ purely cheap .
as you see , shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only from larger companies , because the local ten@@ ds are often not portable for a retailers .
too bad , special stores are almost no more and that , what is still remaining , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peas@@ ant hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery actually comes in some point .
or is it a bit of mind to distribute all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery .
but for a peas@@ ant market , there is a lot more space thanks to the mad@@ sin@@ King - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .

in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown that depend on almost un@@ remarkable - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ es and Haar@@ lem , who were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the ex@@ cer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st signed a 35 @-@ year sentence , after she publicly declared diplomatic news about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted to their competence in technology , computer sciences , and art , whose convic@@ tion was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg caused by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA which could look like with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , like someone could not only look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways , how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been open to the identification as wife since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , but has been condemned in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six viol@@ ets against the sp@@ y law , computer sc@@ aling and theft .
in the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is still sitting on a driver seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde Per@@ gap - associated with it .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &quot; project .
in this , the artist Por@@ traits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts produced like cigar@@ ett@@ enst@@ um@@ mel and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of it , like those people may look like .
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they performed an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany another portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit this time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sent letters , which ex@@ changes several letters in the course of two years .
she even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lies Images , &quot; which would be a future predicted in which the President Chel@@ ains Jud@@ gment would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happ@@ ily meetings .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit of deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump will lead a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ forming troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to resol@@ ve the rigid sp@@ ies that it should actually fix .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going out of a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with its superior signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automated pl@@ unge &quot; whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide ) according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ an artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly , at least in biological respec@@ ts , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hop@@ efully come on , our gen@@ ome is not concerned , who we are , and how frank@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , hence the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an own room , is a page from the above mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it dives with the hands of the United States like King @-@ Hong Kong in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States .
&quot; if they are ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; it is never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the artist , greeted by Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still see if I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was taken before the com@@ ic book - but when it was supposed to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the m@@ asks , by their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ars located like hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
that was also targeted as all in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like the Chelsea movement , like the movement , which shifted behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the Oxford University of Oxford
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is in the course for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff at the University of Oxford who had been a susp@@ icious man after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday the charges were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by Cook County &apos;s National Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several styles .
a warning warning system from the Chicago department established by the Chicago department store that the cor@@ ks was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call from the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was born on the site of the history for dead and investig@@ ating the styles as murder while the police actively sear@@ ches after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em has now been in interro@@ gated and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in contact and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he challenging the susp@@ ects to set down the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their position , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received an upright tip , who said that apartment 10@@ 08 has something happened .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el@@ ly .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation about the inhabitants : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ fs , including any possible domestic demand . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA @-@ road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vi@@ cep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vi@@ cep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world &apos;s anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
in a certain stage of fulfil@@ ment of the criteria of a road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and testing in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the road@@ map of the WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for recovery of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain what could happen to Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned above criteria , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results from the WA@@ DA approved examination by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in regards to the matter mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation , since our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has inserted a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then said : &quot; we have said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the scope of D@@ oping sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA from the execution of D@@ oping control in Russia .
it is however allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General@@ Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved to the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .

start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
Amy salvation wanted to measure the happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers didn &apos;t mourn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was just never con@@ sist@@ ency and obj@@ ec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said salvation which operates the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Gesellschaft Madison Reed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ ters to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measurement of employee commitment , they allows companies to provide surveys , speci@@ fying groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and allow C @-@ Suite to b@@ ypass and turn directly to the Board of Directors in some cases .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools used by companies to measure employees .
salvation said that she has better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap P@@ olls and Sur@@ vey@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that demonstrates that units have the most complaints , and which exec@@ u@@ tives have low tuning results - so you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , that you don &apos;t need to be the next U@@ ber , which has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since a former employee wrote a blog post that describes an environment of Bel@@ ie@@ fs in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for Start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
the global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance business could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , after the financed technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent the help of preventing and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the am@@ id@@ st of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible companies can send customized &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report s@@ lugg@@ ish behaviour .
and when the main business is involved , complaints are directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker @-@ fluctu@@ ation and mon@@ agen , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ tible for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if a employee would have reported a problem , he had to find it or have a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an en@@ roll@@ ment and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
well , since the Company Conver@@ tible , problems , who were previously identified by exec@@ u@@ tives who were previously identified in offices in cities or countries , have been identified - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ er intern@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can close this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view in the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders &quot; employment disp@@ utes . &quot;
companies began to take eth@@ ics , values and employee commitment in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethnic violation by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that company knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software service as service and loads the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval by Venture Capital Invest@@ ors that both start @-@ ups have supported .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with strengthening the whole capital raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer venture Partners and brought his overall funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees are more than expected by their jobs .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only use in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley .
the employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s their voices , and that the work you want to do is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global benefits and Ez@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and involved .
if the Analytics tools speak third parties to increase commitment and the use of staff , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , there is a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or at all , it can motiv@@ ate these dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm K@@ otter International , who has seen business who have reli@@ ed on gathering details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about ?
and if you do not take care of , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who now passes monthly surveys now , was able to initi@@ ate action on the same day when a problem is reported beyond G@@ lin@@ t , to salvation .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was finally able to organize more teams within the company and to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
Ruby Tuesday receives the company always new insights over the staff , and it hopes that on a long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a branch that is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose enterprises .
N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ players on one side of the new practice areas of the teams will be enter@@ tained at the campus .
some have completed their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are in@@ scri@@ bed to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ man Football Center on the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a real cold mill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three courses of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 should start to meet the players already accomplished time players .
the compromise of the two days is more than a day when Bru@@ ins moved to the start of Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play@@ time in West@@ wood .
they are supposed to keep on the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the form@@ ations start for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ stands the change of the N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point of routes to players .
&quot; we lay this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they simply m@@ ashed it , they keep up , they are great people .
I think soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices once the camp is finished , which was subjected to a close car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel which is already covered with foot@@ balls , which will be a safety net behind a door posts , no light task will be .
Bru@@ ins player should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ aming that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not enough to think that people can rent a room there , and then set it there to record a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video of one exercise , it &apos;s pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
therefore I &apos;m not making great wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ sch@@ messages from third parties and their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will start with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to recogn@@ ise possible wrong feedback and they may display the fact test results from the original article .
Facebook has been crit@@ ici@@ zed as one of the main participation points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe that they also influences the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political subject in Europe , with false stories floo@@ ded in May , with false stories , and Germany , if it does not succeed , h@@ ass@@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the knowledge , which stories of fact review of the third parties want to be challenged , people want to see what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sara Su , Product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to be his feature in the &quot; related article &quot; and to test other changes to its news @-@ feed to decrease false news .
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he &apos;s a si@@ p .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent history of its cosy seat in the ad@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s relaxed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac handle@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book by Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; I have just responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double agents in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters always sm@@ elled after smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as he would even be there .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be honest , I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) seems to be very nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle , like about the mon@@ ast@@ eries for walls and bottles that had spent centuries in gra@@ bs .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with land @-@ makers , gar@@ dening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown as the National Trust received its full access in 2006 , when the last replacement was Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
as Rho@@ des a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats told &quot; Oh , &quot; it was described in the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , representing what had said : &quot; one could mean that country conflicts would be bor@@ ing , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
boys , let all go through his ais@@ le ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to spread over bro@@ ader base into the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who built the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ots that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ ant arose in this field and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start .
maybe the two connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ee , which the Dar@@ rell left seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos;s , presented in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell presented his own pol@@ ishing by stu@@ ff@@ ed a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ g was dug out ) .
the dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite appropriate to be able to spend new debts and spend money for things which they could not aff@@ ord .

campaign started : over 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf cover
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Marian Chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef started the launch of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and its marketing team wants to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August it should be a highlight of the campaign for a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for yesterday , the makers of the promotion has played on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday released website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make it clear that it is better than it seems .
basically , we are convinced that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ al citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise which gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef allows for a mid @-@ digit amount and will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the Army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) appro@@ ached pensions and funding in the officer cor@@ ps .
this is the week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing about the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
we also participated in the consultations under the chair@@ manship of the government , including five concepts , as well as the Minister for Defense , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
with this , the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ pass .
the government re@@ trac@@ ed the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been depos@@ ed .
since the failed coup , state of government has fired Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections for the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire of the coup attempt .
against 486 people , which should have been involved directly on the coup attempt , has been involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the crash test as &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s army really on the handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ rav@@ ages in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general Staff , there are occup@@ ations for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ist &quot; of the army , which manifested among others in the re@@ vocation of the head verb@@ s for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
anyway , the large cle@@ ave at the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an per decree issued another 73@@ 95 Heads of State , among them 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when I t@@ amed Erd@@ og@@ an the military .
gener@@ als went earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times , she lodged an appeal to her role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals for the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an , specifically developing an Islam@@ ist of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in few years &quot; full of extreme cases and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this is , NATO could not get cold in NATO .
anyway , there are in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of doub@@ ts about the application of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US Immig@@ ration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he is looking forward to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules of visa for a temporary job permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is expected to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce the wages of wages and save $ billion for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the USA will change the way , like the citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will get the candidates the candidates who have the financial means to help themselves and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
ministry wants to refurb@@ ish route for racing shuttle
again , over the past few months , over the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ g@@ utt@@ les was fought - now it &apos;s very fast .
even before the end of the year the travel route should be built on which the tourist train leaves .
to secure the future of the race boo@@ ths in the long term , according to information from the Ministry of Culture , construction work will begin on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the distance Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ er , the country knows most important for tourism important &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared traffic state Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track was about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country has over 75 percent .
the contract , based on the shuttle , is scheduled to be ordered in the future by the country , it is currently defin@@ ed , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already familiar with technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map that the vehicles used and the quality standards are dealt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
to order the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be available regularly on December 2017 .
the speed@@ sti@@ g shuttle is one of the popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
during the last months , a pilot @-@ operation has been tested , whether the distance of sufficient many people is used to buy them regularly in the future .
the distance is very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the Asc@@ ent of Sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought there will be no more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robot are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor for rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take it seriously .
customers can choose the eyel@@ et of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger nails .
&quot; people make it fun , but the company deliver lots of them , and we will get them much more likely to see , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report .
modern s@@ lu@@ sts have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone scal@@ p that feels warm - with deliber@@ ate human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust to its robots , according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and they can select everything from the eye of the robot on the form of chest strap up to type or the colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still wor@@ r@@ ying , since many robots possess the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; that would look like a Step@@ ford &apos;s wife .
modern s@@ lu@@ sts have developed to robots using a silicone optical system .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x @-@ robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling as so@@ ber .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ in@@ eness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that your personality is as good as possible , &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so let her like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day they took their m@@ oods - quite like real people !
it can be tired to be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in the atmosphere &quot; ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the under@@ c@@ ages female properties that goes on rape if you go one step to fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resi@@ den@@ ying ) Far@@ rah is going , troubled one most .
true to his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is an vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; when women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the site .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex game .
its formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a wish for sex with sub@@ jection as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men are of course not able to keep sex robots , while the FR@@ R will notice its increasing popularity , they still remain pre@@ valent in the fr@@ inge of consumer culture .
but it is le@@ ak out of the border zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulating , until they are the free market for permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that this highly developed sex robot into a time appear in which the rights of women are threatened by women in which there has been a president responsible for women &apos;s sexual attack .
the most fear@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affects the swallowed body and the cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump .
the objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their genetic builders want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point if it is about their &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots constitute no real women .
you can not separate from their companion or simply walk away .
they have no placing or a background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the fantasy tot@@ als .
otherwise , they are counter@@ feit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps large power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the word of the healthy human being
it has become a B@@ ins@@ en@@ we@@ dge of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political sp@@ read@@ ings that have been pol@@ ari@@ zed by the U.S. elec@@ torate has been split into small @-@ format families .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there were newspapers in the U.S. with ratings on how to circum@@ vent relations with the hor@@ ror of Tr@@ ump .
we all rig@@ ged all of us to burst out our filter bub@@ bles .
it has been noticed less , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families come up .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ wing di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago , and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
they rec@@ alled that unity could have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades because of the policy , suddenly and completely independent on the same side .
around the dining table , that certainly is a good thing , but it also falls in another context that this also puts significant risks with itself .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presidency has power to push us all right into the right .
when we speak of &quot; standardi@@ zation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ass@@ able option that his m@@ itt@@ ens don &apos;t get rid of us a day .
however , there is a still fri@@ gh@@ ted long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which appeared in comparison to its standards suddenly as a word of Vern@@ ago .
I find myself nowadays from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s work - the dog on the car roof , which looked at 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild pen@@ alties .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ama of the New York State Department , and the top three dollars which you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously big , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals turning round to look full of their own shoulders - very dark and the sound @-@ per@@ ing music . this means a noticeable way .
so many cler@@ gy of a city bab@@ es : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are to be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just a dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked thereafter .
on the other hand , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
at the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same as the option to pay with a 15 % tip of tip - this to buy something over the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on server to enter personality in a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood before , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us re@@ located with chest pain from the prison
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of Schn@@ itten , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s early morning by taking them several times through a door of the toilet crane in his house in Pre@@ toria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us maintained that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a n@@ igh@@ tly n@@ igh@@ te@@ ling , who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell which they say to d@@ ently op@@ aque .
the National Prosec@@ ut@@ in@@ ance said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : what you need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are expected to improve emission behavior from cars of emission class Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 Diesel or bad are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by the ACE Auto Club Europe are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the handled software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the mandatory updates are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin .
the re@@ armament was arranged by the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a fast implementation in the coming months but no precise date is called .
Daimler told you to write any person concerned .
if it is due to an inspection , it will be done in its frame .
how long will the retro@@ fit end up ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
dra@@ pes from the commitment by the manufacturer as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily re@@ acting the car manufacturers at the subject of environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do not drive any car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will wait for waiting .
presumably foreign manufacturers would take place , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price loss of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE fears .
but in the regions where the fare is dro@@ pping .
in rural areas there are no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .

we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the site is already written out - however , suitable applicants are ra@@ r .
W@@ acker stands for 31 years now .
and the work makes it still great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press brie@@ fing .
it reports varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red that previously no application has been fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architects or construction engineer .
so - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular termination of canc@@ elling - still enough time to el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a Sub@@ e Building Authority , the candidate must indicate corresponding closures .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
would you not be able to fill this anymore , citizens would have to go to Offen@@ burg to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when the city is near , the city and his self is important &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office some significant projects have gathered together , the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city life of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building work and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects in the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the central parking lot are around .
the cinem@@ atic bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium roof is still subject .
the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; the W@@ acker is estimated .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a city building large game room .
with ha@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted on multi@@ ples .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chi@@ pper , and the design of the gre@@ enery are often not mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do what will be approved , &quot; if new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ating city building .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ master carries high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything is running on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been around for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
also , that his successor remains , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we seek someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the spot . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city .
those who want to inherit Roland W@@ acker should have a completed studies as a Gradu@@ ate Engine@@ er or Bachelor with specialist architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction and building planning .
planning and civil engineering , building management , under@@ under@@ line affairs , administration of urban property , municipal farm with building yard and municipal office and under@@ taking construction companies including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South track closed
according to the police , the un@@ familiar do@@ ers had been thrown by the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so strongly damaged that the freight for@@ age had to be adher@@ ed to .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators and search for the night hours after them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the Tat@@ ar , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed from witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ enst@@ rich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators , who , or the perpet@@ rators , have killed himself in a great danger and also the train service is endangered .
in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the facility and the delay and the cost of rail transport , even P@@ ön@@ alen could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum to go out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the South Pacific could be managed without disabilities .
there were almost 10 people there were Friday mor@@ nings , two of which were about correspondence .
freight rates did not fell , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory bow@@ el )

but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients could relie@@ ve symptoms of inflamm@@ atory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , causes mag@@ nific@@ ence and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or bloody emer@@ gen@@ cies , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the suffer@@ ers usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of protein helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna stated that immune cells in the bow@@ el is patented in order to ensure harmful micro@@ bes that are hidden in the food .
cells that are capable to resol@@ ve inflamm@@ ations are balanced by cells , promote the tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive fabric .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it may result in inflamm@@ atory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it has been determined that a type of tolerance conveying immune cell in mice occurs that toler@@ ate a particular bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of protein - to resol@@ ve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in her food , the more they had from this immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less inflamm@@ atory col@@ li@@ eus supports , when the same system also work with people .
the post@@ doc capacity in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance when she found that a group of study en@@ closures had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe that was not accommodated but that was not .
it assumed that the difference to do the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the war@@ ms of mice were detected DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice .
mice were checked in a ster@@ ile environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they were created by the L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and immun@@ otherapy .
to understand how the bacteria looked on the immune system , the researchers investigated L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on in@@ sufficient immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant conveying cells .
when the active component has been cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ ones were hal@@ ved , the number of cells sank by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an @-@ side @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflamm@@ atory bow@@ el diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; signed by N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impres@@ ses in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
M@@ atic was however , however , had been excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues in only 45 minutes , which had to improve Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks of football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready before . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent In this week revealed that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho died three more newly committed , but he insi@@ sted that the club has made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet three of his four former officers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; three out of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner to the sky .
the pilots flew in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the sh@@ iel@@ ding , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .

new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind twi@@ sted off : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was yet the SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Minister always looked before elections with a certain concern after Berlin .
only no stor@@ ks from the party centre , merely no counter@@ wind out of the covenant - thus the most important wish of suff@@ ers .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ house has ever seen the state capit@@ als in the capit@@ als @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als .
what Schulz said from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter wind in the approach .
there were dr@@ ills .
and indeed , one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU provides a general signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows more : red @-@ green is simply not reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising Fra@@ ction instrum@@ entation of a Green M@@ EPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green Coalition was lost against the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
Michael Kell@@ ner , the Green Federal President Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the ab@@ dic@@ ed Lower Saxony @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ enn to return its mandate .
the invasion of the CDU means a clear revision of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ uns must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal executive leader and turn@@ out leader of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ ed a SPD election , as in Friday morning the new Hi@@ king Message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the invasion of the green M@@ ke T@@ iny to the CDU without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the mis@@ ery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , soo@@ thes the com@@ rades of his time .
according to the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
it was then too much worse - and it was much worse .
the SPD &apos;s defeat in Kiel brought the party out into the trade fair , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ k@@ hau@@ te led the party in smooth .
in the weeks , the com@@ rades re@@ vil@@ ed after the weeks .
then , when they had caught new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next low@@ ish came .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD landmark , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his town .
and because in the crisis , in the crisis , everything was in@@ correct , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gases and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism for the country .
Mi@@ ese Com@@ frac@@ tom@@ y came .
nevertheless , or maybe even so , because in recent weeks , Weil attempted to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
in addition , com@@ rades of the former mayor of Hanover who had his power in Berlin remained not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him allow for a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
thus , because of the internal struggle , the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Green is not guilty .
and Schulz do not even look at all .
nevertheless , the com@@ rades have been ende@@ av@@ oured to keep his own rows .
their wrath is governed by gre@@ enery , and above all on the ab@@ dic@@ ed par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy agreement , such as Mrs. T@@ kov@@ ice , her own career feed on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of part@@ itions in the SPD parliamentary leadership , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ iny has not been elected to parliament as a director , but on the country list of Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party , so the Lower Saxony dep@@ uties continued .
the logical consequence would be that it returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliament , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters of four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people have made Stephan Weil as the minister @-@ president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the personal career of a future CDU faction , Op@@ per@@ mann said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know whether there was more or passed by the CDU of Lower Saxony .
funding for the town center III
who wants to san@@ e to come into the years , may get assistance from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a look back to the events so far .
since 1991 , it has been in sensation of renov@@ ations .
then , in the San@@ ge area I from 1991 to 2004 , the federal state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , this allowance was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous san@@ itation is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only to complete new building areas .
on April 4 I received information from the governing of the President of the State of Karlsruhe to give it a san@@ itation area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which there are 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest from the community feelings .
how does a san@@ itation facility then originate ?
one will continue to investigate so sh@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; homes are .
but it also plays a role in the planned area of interest , to san@@ e .
if necessary , the District limits could also shift again .
the Ste@@ g appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ ovina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the &quot; Social City &quot; program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the structures would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of internal cities that improve residential and employment relationships and preservation and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would involve objective , that is to be held per plot .
finally , the restoration area would eventually be established as a statute .
the approval period for the funding is running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the inventory would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment .
in November or December , as possible , the set of propositions should be made , thus in the coming year with renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that any Commun@@ e had to execute the said pre @-@ surveys .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban@@ isation and decide when it is rest@@ ated and in what extent do .
it will be entered for the respective plot then also a san@@ itation included in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come after s@@ enti@@ sts and make a picture of the location , she promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and Basic arch &quot; where it is among other things about the building condition and the san@@ itation view .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing arc , &quot; the data may be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operation bogen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only sufficient to fill in the building &apos;s premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a printed questionnaire is not con@@ ferred at the same time as a request for funding .
furthermore , restructuring measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still stressed that the distribution of the conveyor belt after the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you cannot reserve any conveyor belts for later . &quot;
more photos of the &quot; village center II &quot; were shown in order to make the presence of a san@@ itation .
British invent@@ or is himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip in order to open his house door , and even can start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and hands , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy your life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an ad@@ visory board of an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ists in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology res@@ embles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Law@@ n for an event that resulted in the American production of the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers were sent to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as marine One , when the president is aboard , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter was created in Connecticut with a yacht out of Maine , a fire brig@@ ade from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before helicop@@ ters landed on the South Law@@ n , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of that , because it is such an ordinary event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , the Deputy Nav@@ al of Aviation .
the message showed that helicopter met on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be needed for return flight .
the original air@@ planes found during the event during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained at the plane while the plane remained at the plane .
out of the TIM@@ E record reports did not clearly show whether ultimately became a second flight @-@ crew required .
at Brands Act , the Federal Law committed to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate its determination .
&quot; a question we asked if there was a violation of the Hatch Acts , and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; said the Deputy Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political harmon@@ ics .
at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to reduce governmental rules .
the use of an aircraft that is known as marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
pre@@ sidents are required to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out a study in February , when the presidential plane rose before the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and its Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states are manufactured by American workers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the deputy head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Law@@ n through to depos@@ e the US president in the White House with precise cuts .
as Tr@@ ump in early July on the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flying crew for the month , an official said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units took up 11 hours a day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were taking the load for none of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
the spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in this helicopter to issue the helicopter on the South Law@@ n .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have any budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the Trial Chamber of the US Ministry of Defense for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D equipment for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers is calculated on the basis of estimates for the equi@@ pping sets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the equipment for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Sean Sp@@ inning , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that will be produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ . .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on them .
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ relessly worked .
it is naturally appropriate to lift up that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter , when he entered his round about the South Law@@ n for the event , but he sat down in the passenger seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and sh@@ ear with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only eat children who are cared for 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Sub@@ sidi@@ aries have from 1st September Chef : they heat the delivered meals , they supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed facilities , like seven @-@ troop facilities - decides about the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger and it is easier to implement educational and ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it goes : healthy diet and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team may be avoided .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
these continu@@ ity was important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in future by a special cleaning service .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power also has the charm which they have been in the cost comparison between own governments and fore@@ ver@@ ing for the city as the most economic growth , it says of the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers will be discontinued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall not so strong for approximately 750 people in the educational field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of the Society , including the women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are caused by the Council &apos;s Council in the provinces . three women can can@@ dic@@ ate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections are only truly representative and cre@@ dible , if women are restricted to participate and involved in all parts of the election process .
elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the Presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
the Taliban released thre@@ ats against an election process that come together with the transition from international fighting resources to an ad@@ visory role .
this year , the elections for the first time passed the power peace@@ fully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next time .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , &quot; a strong role for women will boost the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent election report reported that 1.2 million women of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concern on investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to join the Bis@@ c@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie to produce long @-@ term commitment to the production plant in the Glasgow plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company spent over the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work consisting of other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if its activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch of the company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s &quot; concerns , &quot; concerns concerns that the financing of production lines will not be driven by . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity over the future requirements and investment plans for the future of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ oll@@ cross &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrate strongly on the local community and the large region Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social action .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , pay@@ roll and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing civil society and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a flour@@ ishing production line at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a female player from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it since we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we operate like all businesses that are active in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic climate , our stores continuously check - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our dreams , in particular , in production lines and operative improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ns three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the side of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regre@@ t
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after they have given an offer of £ 189 million to resol@@ ve his free reign , but they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
after the completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is w@@ alled by the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , even though a source in the vicinity of the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to worry about it since his coming from Santos in 2013 to worry about it .
but was the football world war@@ ns three years ago from the PS@@ G president in front of this prosp@@ ect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they touch one of our players , then we will be standing in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , the Spanish club posted interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti Bu@@ ilt at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by getting one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; cathedral @-@ atzen report ent@@ ail Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain Report on the mis@@ erable accidents of Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report of the sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station goes further for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he acquired by the former ruler Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regre@@ t on their own sub@@ missions , or to express their in@@ correct assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand crit@@ ici@@ zed that in the reporting on violence regarding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regards to the over@@ gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be ashamed and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; but the &quot; degree of media mani@@ pulation has to be prevented , so the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sen@@ sel@@ ess to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that is suitable for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church and it is a little fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they pointed out that in her youth , &quot; hits a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; to be done , &quot; in order to be able to get ready . &quot;
fires are un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse occurred often Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; entirely to in@@ justice , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ izing the fact that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality the punishment for the pupils could also be more fier@@ cely .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other readers , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories will be linked with him . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ emann , why the final report of the mis@@ chief report was explained by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger from his opinion .
Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Inci@@ dents of non@@ violence at the shel@@ ters &quot; shel@@ ters &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
many students take up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who was musi@@ cally @-@ able when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was musi@@ cally no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if one gets the trouble and reads the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , it is more likely to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
only eight pages are dedicated and it is cleared by every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or fellow @-@ ignor@@ ance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre@@ school occurred outside the scope of action .
you may not take it too late , of which too late or first menti@@ ons do not have taken serious enough .
at which he worked as literally , &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; was performed by practically all respondents .
so also the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent witness , describes him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; under@@ stand@@ ful teachers , who supplies the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons .
only a minority is characterized by its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotions , which led to W@@ ut@@ out@@ breaks even once .
that he had not only kno@@ cked out with chairs and cast down the keys on the floor , but also ear@@ chers , and too young guys moved to the hair or ears , he has already been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted to be deeply regre@@ t@@ ted .
according to his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period , the 1960s and 1970s , widely distributed as teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also seen it in a world@@ ly school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with what it is actually working in this report , namely to the horri@@ fying sexual abuse and the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the free co@@ at@@ els .
there you &apos;re already wonder@@ ing if there were not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media were waiting for him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many people who have never understood him have never been e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report de@@ bur@@ dened by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every regard !
in connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Domain was reported .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed some processing or fellow workers with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confidence in the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dreamed to talk with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said likewise to the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embar@@ r@@ assing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem of ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , but is that most victims of shame will be silent .
if they did not commit parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ orus , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you rate the dom@@ est@@ ranged student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : an un@@ questi@@ onably student formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had earlier findings and could have been able to wake up their perpet@@ rators .
I keep it ... also for really absur@@ d to assume that just him ... Bu@@ ben ein@@ dr@@ ing@@ able or clear@@ er or even rather opened , than against their parents , Internet guides , trust instruc@@ tors etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the clear result of the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that occurred in the ap@@ ron of affected students and / or their environment , could not be confirmed during the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of all fellow workers .
he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ tory crime , as it happened in some cases .
in the media there was a lot of &quot; violent attacks &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is subjected to the &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; report .
does he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and devast@@ ated became a huge cluster from sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen school , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once , other ant@@ ages .
in addition , the report deals from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the cathedral .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were en@@ acted and mal@@ ici@@ ously , all of them had failed to have occurred on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ ep@@ y states have to rule .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ man gramm@@ ar school .
it was , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was just happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ist gramm@@ ar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a discipline , but no sa@@ w@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases combine even positive memories with him . &quot;
at the most , the alleg@@ ations still remains to have taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods , in which the states were reported on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he had not worked and was responsible ( such a witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger closed the ears at the states ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
in it he shows that , &quot; that in the pre@@ school , the test may continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
despite the danger of negative pressure resistance , he had an urgent consideration .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity had already been banned as test pen@@ alties in Bavaria .
before that , they occurred in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows from us well .
there was too hard for him to be elu@@ sive , where the person affected could not be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or deterior@@ ated , and where really the allow@@ able border was exceeded .
but it can &apos;t say that he would have been chew@@ ed .
that is not right .
the test was officially abolished in the year 1980 , and was officially abolished in Bavaria .
princip@@ alities and tax@@ is said in Gloria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is , it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards for the time of time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans are talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fall@@ ou@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the danger that happened to today &apos;s moral units . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there the prin@@ cess has already right .
but this is not true of sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence in innocent children &apos;s activities , that &apos;s already far beyond that .
this is all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it is finally getting started .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and Pun@@ ishment , thus ear@@ chers , and to drag and ears to the hair , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a result of physical punishment , he was kept strictly on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his incar@@ nation has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing too ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph , so the Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a sc@@ roll .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t get there , that he led there a stric@@ test reg@@ iment there .
but this too has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably not have been possible to form a real cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singer and before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ su@@ re@@ ation .
what kind of people have you experienced in their book by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
Michael E@@ emann : I really met with the work on the book and Beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger again and again and again , as wonderful , hum@@ orous , deeply believing and heart@@ felt good people , of which one can not imagine that he could do something like a fly .
I regularly get to him how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant still have to keep him , 23 years after his efforts to visit him regularly - he &apos;s almost blind - and he is to treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grat@@ eful to him today that he has enriched its life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a severe father , certainly knows what may be - but also a lov@@ able Resp@@ ect@@ on@@ son , to whom they still looks and honour her right now .
and please , once again clearly : everything one th@@ rows it , are educational methods that were then on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin bo@@ ck .
there is the evil int@@ ent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , was dischar@@ ged him .
now the counter @-@ fields would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great contributions from Bavaria and probably still in Germany nobody would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger domain from Germany , finally to leave peace in peace .
