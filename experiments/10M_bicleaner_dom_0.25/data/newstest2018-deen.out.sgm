<seg id="4">Small gardener manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when maps are not currently current.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows what you had to offend because the Auto-Navi had a green meadow instead of a strabypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern attributes, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria within the state government, are everything else - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a FlickenteppI, one recognizes them as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overlook card, more detailed maps, called urinary tract, were incorporated for cities and communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were originated according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and of the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Armed Forces occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and had a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when French troops arrived at the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, the neighbours today that the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map were created.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV" "" "Joseph drove the project ahead, the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The foundation for Munich is from the year 1856 and can be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison / Today is the example of the state capital on the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">In all directions the city has expanded and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is submissions, which is still relatively isolated in the card from 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the card, i.e. 1877, the Munich quarter.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today is undersendling in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of submissions concentrate around 1856 along with today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can't see anything as fields - at first glance: in entering zooming a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten passage from the so-called "Urge" which was derived from the base tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots have no farmers there - but small gardeners of the grounds "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Lower sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow, and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar gives the historical map an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the rehearsal view, in the area of the today's District Au-Haidhausen, you do not only read the street name "at the guest house" or from the height "On the lute" - but also in big letters "erstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfield Road one finds people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "in 1858 / 59.</seg>
<seg id="34">Starting in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the institution, that he was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended the purchase of the so-called." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he also taught the staff to use violence against the use, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later on 500 places was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirritation institute in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Youth up in the Munich Salesianum is now on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and went in a youth house with vocational training.</seg>

<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also at the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies began in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a salutation at the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof, where this day the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-card can be rescued with the aerial photo of today's aerial view and fill the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Mayor Group publishes itineration for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the promotion of dyes has issued a warning for colored people who travel to the state of the discriminating policy and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which is scheduled to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourceans, since a series of fragile, rary-based incidents in the entire state, and here is stated," it is stated in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people heavy, discriminating discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state to admit the undisproportionate to minorities, the Group said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have breaches of the civil rights that happen to men.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be broken down or killed because of their skin colour, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard nor heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group cited Incidents such as racial Versions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">He died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any more fuel and had been accused by the police of Missouri in custody without any crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the offices of the Attorney General of Missouri in which black drivers in the state will be able to hold 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of people and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring out whether they would like to bring? or the relatives know that they are travelling by the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri was recorded by the FBI in 2015, following the latest numbers from the Hasselt review of the FBI, which ranks the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The journey is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to complain a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued itineraries for Texas and Arizona, to undertake the local prosecution authorities to undertake people for migrant violations, which will contribute to the list of the ACLU for further raction.</seg>
<seg id="66">Itinerations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but at the last time, stakeholders have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>

<seg id="68">The fiserbach electric fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU federal parliament Peter white and Kordula Kovac have delivered a picture before the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the court yard of Schwennmann, the representative of the CDU village group met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwennmann set first insights into its operation in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest farmed, 40 dairy cows, and as many young ones and houses in five apartments.</seg>

<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferieby comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the "" Elemental project "as an element name."</seg>

<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers need to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope so that the drifting of surfaces could be gone up for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure whom we have, are people who work in agriculture and thoughts about how they keep going on," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in critique in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were enclosed in 2013 of eleven participants throughout 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be fed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half of them were promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the town of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus they did not keep the farmers to invest €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwennmann." ""</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate this as well as every other - so the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein's seat at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he had a symbolic axe in a heated war with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposal of President to drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller doesn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">One horde of boaters and liberty Imitators could have aroused it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the importance that you have been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta implanted, "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom that lightened the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively properly, but how he formulated it, it is not really about story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It goes around the contemporary response to the shattering words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state will not only load any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "your gardening, your poor, and your oppressed masses, that trusts in it, to breathe freely;</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "garbage" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller served not in literary criticism - he clearly pointed out that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that they complete a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by present the female embodiment of freedom from French and American republicism.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself gives itself a quite different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great strand as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite, but rather an early neo-conservative, who wants to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not shine the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here to something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative fact of Lazarus consisted in it, they looked so to see how they were seen from the exhaustive, but hopeless people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it is the sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their refuge and improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever would like to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not shine on the way, but the hatred that is the only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="140">"Eilidh is fairly modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Your capitalist speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or, wherever they live or exercise, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">In this way, the central stretch of Muir leads to five British and two European records during the last year.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home-World Championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: don't get rid of a public ministry if you do not wear it from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the internal politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shook during the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>

<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a fixed hand during the leadership of his state and strict adherence of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also highly sent to use Facebook as a primary agent to link with his voters and play his hairless head to form chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons appearing on the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defending the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to use a message by simply blocking a critics or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's a lot of cleaner than in previous time when men have been done so that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guiding angles and to burn or demonstrators to silence or to silence.</seg>

<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlingen mountain apart from the former parish church, there was also a manorial court that belonged to the church or Patronatsrighted and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Chief Freudenstadt from 1858, it was adjacent to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today is still visible in the local picture of tumours, the "Mount" of the third, the splendid settlement of the village.</seg>

<seg id="489">Only the bell tower let it stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Years of 1834 a storm cut off the steeple tower and the half collapsed.</seg>

<seg id="884">The recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method for medical judging their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested people were older than 18 years. however, not everyone believes to the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority of Forensic Medicine (Rättsabinhale) has started with the implementation of the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish MigrationsAuthority (Migrationsverket) were criticised for errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were undermined.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, migrationsverket 6,880 was sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432, the conclusion was that the person "possibly under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is challenged.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of 80-s, for the 90-years-Grunge-era (as the Vorker David Wain and Michael Showage), and for yourself - that is, for 2001, before her stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to major things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As an cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise, it feels like the time would fall short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd Humors (it contained a original history for a speaking box vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By taking on the core of the Gags - Actor middle age play ropes of children who grow up - they still create the impossibility of winning the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later" with his parents who now play adults is less emotional and his parody goes out more after the watering principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90-s, like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that cradle the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">One point is a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and a series of other things from 1991. "</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The favorite Coop (Mr. Showage), now Romanticor, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virility.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malicious plot that is involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always the extra courses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd to see the Matt Dillons Unterlippenbart of 'singles, "whose former big one-on-Camp Andy is getting married as an old chacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments of random madness to heat this franchise like a sort of repeated "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," the last scene will show the band as they will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon has now recalls a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," on the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "Glow" with its East-against-West ring fight-iconography.</seg>

<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice pictures regarding the reputation (the police takes the time to watch chess in television, as Americans may possibly do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous speakers - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloom Sevigny - provides a contingent game 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda dramas - a robbers who carries a Reagan mask is involved, that it often plays as a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six episodes episodes, the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was placed on a lower length, could not deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor und Iosef once again visited the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who swallow up a bunch of Hamburg.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the style for the program.</seg>

<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with their deceased father, Colin is described as "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul approximately one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">It says that Colin property has valued at $316 million, and Paul has valued at $176 million.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, he met his first work in president Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to repair: bad information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waitry diagnosis makes sense, but others have attempted to tell a dump by controlling his media control.</seg>
<seg id="1397">The president Trumps relationship lasts for many decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his televisions is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was offended because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key, Trumps Twitter custom consists of control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption has a steady lobbprice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever was "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these Kampagners know something that we do not know, that Trumps Tweets have still contained more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably learn anything about the tweets, the trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had already managed to hold a few times, trouble from him, then their effort was worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody knew it consistently that Trump is calling out trophy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a white house that convenes itself from competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by promoting trump materials, which may improve their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported more information about the preference of consultants, president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former jump officials said that Trump can react to negative press clips, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he will find out how these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when somebody was willing to cast a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster to be of his cheques" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson became exiled from Twitter, or that he has not offered a concrete evidence, or that he expressed false allegations in the past and contradicts it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire at the staff of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff of Chief of the White House, Rob Porter, "attempted to implement a system to control the paper, and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still in influence.</seg>

<seg id="1481">The Panel included the work last weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under vocation against the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there are already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accused the Kremlin to have committed himself to the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether they were talking between Trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are expected to take place in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also increased more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post," wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderner Trump personally had moved into the centre and underscore the allegations of whether the president could possibly disabled the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to test this evidence in possible suspicion and decide whether it shall be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jury will therefore also refer to count chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to recharge people under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN's station, these charges were exhibited, which around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">You should also prepare documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his damaging electoral head Paul Manafort.</seg>

<seg id="1499">But it must not be forced to decide that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the introduction of the committee on the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme give the Democrats a way to feel good "because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special consultant Ty Cobb explained in one position, he knew nothing of the introduction of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">However, this work as well as usually in the engerms, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House fears all measures that accelerated the work of the special society on "fair" manner.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was stated in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this incident, allegations were made against Trump, he waged the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey said before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him a setting of the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1532">A complete chaviest is there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some evidence that the Larsen-C Schelty is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under voltage and can be disrupted, if you break a piece in one of the key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelongs and Eisberg will not increase the sea level because they swim on the water and poets the ice as much water as it yields itself after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the scrap leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level, but only in a small dimensions, the British research project is writes the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>

<seg id="1543">Scientists should be disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelov may grow again or go back in the long term, and possibly together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1785">Again, the artist inspired him to inspire.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is decreasing because of the conditions of drought and because of the infirmities of insects, in which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions that are trying to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed in the impact of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and in the fall much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf, and at very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, UNTERENTWICKELTE, and either missing or damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays, to examine their plans for the reporting of the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unstoppable drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss which feel safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office which were the aim of an attack with granules, or let them go home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words written on a board at the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter, name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug muggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand at the bottom of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and during all the country the bodies are frequent, there are always more journalists: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under threat and threats under federal law and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the editor and its Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake it is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is deeply felt deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two Reporter in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts that will show his ridiculous face with eyewear or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their divided topics, the trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">"" "" "" "" "" "in 2010, a songney General was established to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of journalists just two criminal proceedings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are linked to drug trafficking and organisational crimes, the murderers of journalists are only rare in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforted and even though the terrain is now even more ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meetings for discussion of security has little advantage, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid that time to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know not the Why, miserable we all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was gone away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing about the subject of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans, last year and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's most bloodiesels in the country, where rivalising fractions were struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa any day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of galvanized, two-story Mausoleen for drug might who are larger than many houses for the Living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only a cartel takes control over the coastal governmental with its valuable ports and drugs-trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising cartons in war with guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication might have expired the sons, the Ganged members purchased each copy of the issue, as soon as they had delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in that Valdez was not forced to force Valdez, after confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country for its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a landmark in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long, that his friends and colleagues said he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the company with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without emming journalism," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honourable coverage, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard tread examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could deal with anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of CPJ-Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in October last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take the task of taking over to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do about that of many dead... why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a harbour worker, who was a friend, generously with hugs and counters, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and there is always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has compelled them to question their own statements about it in question, how to do their work on the best, and keep alive in the life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their young businesses, their home start and runways," to move drugs. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censored and self maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own Instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, lead away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "odour a sense that can be mocked... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling roubles, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The scenery changed constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff met from Riodoce for security training, there were suddenly no cellphones allowed. days previously announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">There are two police protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, some of the Reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, which the governor itself did not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug bound de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has spent on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the former renowned Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé for the state spending which focused on the home town of the governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir from the office of the Office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug hands and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter knew from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a Politiker, who ruled the regaining Revolution Party (pri), who ruled almost the whole century all the political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-calibre events.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal" "" "Villarreal asked Reporter to write about previous events in this locality, including one where a son of" El Chapo "" "" Guzman had a military attack. "" "</seg>

<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist at the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1891">This day director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez laminated the authorities to oppress journalists and to reinstate them because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since that she is separated from the government because she is concerned that her rage has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes committed to the government officials and a Gender Equality Society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drugs, but also on orders of policies and security forces, which are committed by a organized crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily patched dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from pirate, and used a barn technique which is known as counterattatting, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to soften his enemies, experts say that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosrs has been making headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have studied the wild animal and has called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the form of sheds and armor on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the conversation, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than her underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady shady is customary, the results are surprising when the size of Borealopelta significantly exceeds the living animals today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was chased out of sufficient pressure by meat-nivorous dinosaurs according to the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the connectivity - do you think about Rehe, Zebras or gird animals - are much smaller and injury than prey, which signals that this camdossier was exposed to a real fight.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong smoke-tier behavior on a massive, strong red dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs roaring-animals of the Cretaceous must have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was rotated.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on critics about his life, including his convenings, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and fell into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta were as warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1994">It simply confirms the phone that the card is taken and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently a test run runs on two routes.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to utilize the use, however, some requirements must be met: one needs a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one must have booked an online ticket - what you can do in most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be bought via the app for the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way in the ticket office.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And most recently you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works as follows: one rises in the train, calls his ticket under "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers a button on electronic standings appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendant has a message to their mobile devices a message that Passgast X is located in the train and taken the booked seating area Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the pull-seat control comes to square Y he knows that a passenger is placed in a very valuable online ticket.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Who drives you often, know that beside delays and pasest trains, the chassis checks are among the largest sleeves as well.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case one of the participants do not need any documents, which you need to pay online tickets for the evaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or number of personal credit or identity card or a document must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence are endless discussions between migrating managers and driving gassed, which leads to poor atmosphere in the part or large room and delays with the control of your own tickets and take the Schaffner at the end the time to take care of others.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activists came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken at its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the one sat in St. Louis Geborens on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and there is still on the street," "" "it was there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody had posted the information on her feed, it closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live too tweets.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postulated a painting of Browns leblosem body that was stretched out on the street and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "thought Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was not new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She made her mobile phone to return to tweets on the Canfield Drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the cried, and from a man who claimed to be browns his father, who contributed a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellhop dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said that another policeman shout his shotgun, and he cried, "I will kill you...</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "Ferrell recalls their statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we are accustomed to us and we can call it typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked an excursion and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two on the next morning would go to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and Protestants, love and loss of resistance, the strength and resistance, which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a floral dress and a suitable crown, brought the two a conversation, which they had numerous occasions in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she reminded about what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It needs to know and see it and be taken in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I'm lucky enough to give her a experience in which they personally experienced no matter of racism, it is not unlike the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to hold them away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with local partners, the lunch did.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly I began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after the 9th August," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurse Association was concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "you want to record or try to find a story which you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">How Folayan declared recently in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to make it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His dedication to Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" over the years of Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Fertills's experience - to show that it is not a Christian leader, but for a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain similarity at this work and in case of human beings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history is repeated the role of black breakers women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "two of the three founder of the movement, which according to the killing of the black Teenagers Trayby Martin's" "" "BlacklivesMatter" "" "in social media identify themselves than gay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement," said Ferrell, "and so we fight on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must carry the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan voted to notice that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an antibiotic type of action," by Ferrell's heart to be selected as heart of the movie.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person that shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, although it was at the front front because of a life in these clocks as a black, sule woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news-eras in Ferguson has long been gone, but the rassical connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking with a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociolitical atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they danced for singing and she herself committed to this memory, ever since she went to Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "Orwahn": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone pens the population in Beetworter and opponent in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">It's hard to get the theme.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While they say to a bit gallery: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "that would be real-class" (Nicole Schaumann), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Bing) or quite simply: "magnitudes!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the Beetters indicates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the other businesses should benefit from fear the opponents that then blaze the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned to be exactly on the premises in which the peasant market stands, in which 13 direct market will provide their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work, there will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been buying almost every week in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the gins always liked again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is that.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small markthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct market in a market hall in the gallery, come to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "the new project should probably not be low in the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the buying ship in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, druge- or supermarkets: I think it is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are enough space in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not yet another ordinary weekly market, it is all more important that at least you will receive the market hall at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the product offered there is fresh, is largely offered by producers and is obendpurely cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop shops are rented in a shopping mall only from larger companies, because the local tends are often not portable for a retailers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores are almost no more and that, what is still remaining, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasant hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration if the bit gallery actually comes in some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it a bit of mind to distribute all the shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market, there is a lot more space thanks to the madsinKing - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the peasant market is broken, will disappear again a piece of culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A proper similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown that depend on almost unremarkable - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tues and Haarlem, who were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst signed a 35-year sentence, after she publicly declared diplomatic news about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted to their competence in technology, computer sciences, and art, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg caused by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA which could look like with these genomic data, like someone could not only look with these genomic data - the many ways, how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been open to the identification as wife since its puberty, but has been condemned in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violets against the spy law, computer scaling and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grained, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is still sitting on a driver seat and carries a platinblonde Pergap - associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 "Stranger Visions" project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist Portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts produced like cigarettenstummel and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of it, like those people may look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they performed an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany another portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg, a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit this time and she couldn't be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were sent letters, which exchanges several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">She even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Supplies Images," which would be a future predicted in which the President Chelains Judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happily meetings.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit of deep and strong, since Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from the government camp and against transforming troops to find new, tweetable ways to resolve the rigid spies that it should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg, after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things are going out of a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with its superior signature, among them (the "i" in their family name is equipped with a heart) an end of the "automated plunge" whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide) according to the highly developed scientific encyclopean artist), like amazingly, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people hopefully come on, our genome is not concerned, who we are, and how frankly" "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, hence the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an own room, is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it dives with the hands of the United States like King-Hong Kong in the hand of the disciplines of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they are chill your speech, then they have won," says it.</seg>
<seg id="2151">"it is never the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "" "she said the artist, greeted by Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still see if I speak about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was taken before the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, by their own genomic simulars located like hordes of Protestants.</seg>
<seg id="2155">That was also targeted as all in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced a turbulent history of its cosy seat in the adl River Valley in Kent and now is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England's relaxed the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, coming British artist - Isaac handleiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have just responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter, which was written by a double agents in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought there will be no more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyelet of the robot, its form of the nipple and the type of finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make it fun, but the company deliver lots of them, and we will get them much more likely to see," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern slusts have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone scalp that feels warm - with deliberate human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust to its robots, according to its beliefs "and they can select everything from the eye of the robot on the form of chest strap up to type or the colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying, since many robots possess the "personalities" that would look like a Stepford's wife.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern slusts have developed to robots using a silicone optical system.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix-robot allows for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as sober.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shineness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that your personality is as good as possible," the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So let her like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day they took their moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired to be fixed on conversation, or it can be "in the atmosphere"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the undercages female properties that goes on rape if you go one step to frigid (called here: residenying) Farrah is going, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True to his website True Companion Roxxxy is an vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"when women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex game.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its formation and increasing refinement indicate a little darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a wish for sex with subjection as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are of course not able to keep sex robots, while the FRR will notice its increasing popularity, they still remain prevalent in the fringe of consumer culture.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps large power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the word of the healthy human being</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenwedge of the trump-era that the political spreadings that have been polarized by the U.S. electorate has been split into small-format families.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there were newspapers in the U.S. with ratings on how to circumvent relations with the horror of Trump.</seg>

<seg id="2429">It has been noticed less, the power of Trumps, families come up.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing dichterin, who lives in Chicago, and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They recalled that unity could have a mighty effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they fought for decades because of the policy, suddenly and completely independent on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, that certainly is a good thing, but it also falls in another context that this also puts significant risks with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the effect of his presidency has power to push us all right into the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "standardization" and trump, we refer to the grassable option that his mittens don't get rid of us a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a still frighted long-term scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalized" which appeared in comparison to its standards suddenly as a word of Vernago.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's work - the dog on the car roof, which looked at 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur as very mild penalties.</seg>

<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carusel is still a strange magical experience, since two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red flesh and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients could relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, causes magnificence and bleaching, recurring or bloody emergencies, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the sufferers usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of protein helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna stated that immune cells in the bowel is patented in order to ensure harmful microbes that are hidden in the food.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable to resolve inflammations are balanced by cells, promote the tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive fabric.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has been determined that a type of tolerance conveying immune cell in mice occurs that tolerate a particular bacterium in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of protein - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in her food, the more they had from this immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory collieus supports, when the same system also work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoc capacity in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a kind of immune cell that promotes the tolerance when she found that a group of study enclosures had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe that was not accommodated but that was not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference to do the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The warms of mice were detected DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were checked in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they were created by the L. Cruteri and immunotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria looked on the immune system, the researchers investigated L. reuteri in a liquid and then overled small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on insufficient immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant conveying cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan-Metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophones were halved, the number of cells sank by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "cathedral-atzen report entail Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domain Report on the miserable accidents of Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report of the scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen station goes further for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissening, spokesman for the reform movement "We are church," stated after the publication of the German press agency, he acquired by the former ruler Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret on their own submissions, or to express their incorrect assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican law" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticized that in the reporting on violence regarding the" "" "two measures" "" "measure." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regards to the overgrips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be ashamed and shameful acts, "but the" degree of media manipulation has to be prevented, so the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the senseless to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that is suitable for normal" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Princess of Thurn and taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we would like to go to the church and it is a little frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, they pointed out that in her youth, "hits a completely normal pedagogical means" to be done, "in order to be able to get ready."</seg>
<seg id="2899">Fires are unfair, today's standards for earlier decades, because the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse occurred often Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "entirely to injustice, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarizing the fact that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">At high Emotionality the punishment for the pupils could also be more fiercely.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to many other readers, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories will be linked with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Eemann, why the final report of the mischief report was explained by Georg Ratzinger from his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of nonviolence at the shelters" shelters "is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Many students take up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholesterol and perfectionist, who was musically-able when a Domspatz was musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if one gets the trouble and reads the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, it is more likely to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages are dedicated and it is cleared by every suspicion of the mid- or fellow-ignorance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the preschool occurred outside the scope of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may not take it too late, of which too late or first mentions do not have taken serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">At which he worked as literally, "salvation", "heaven" and "better world" was performed by practically all respondents.</seg>
<seg id="2918">So also the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent witness, describes him as "warm," "competently," "competent," and "understandful teachers, who supplies the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is characterized by its perfectionism and its high emotions, which led to Wutoutbreaks even once.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he had not only knocked out with chairs and cast down the keys on the floor, but also earchers, and too young guys moved to the hair or ears, he has already been deeply regretted to be deeply regretted.</seg>
<seg id="2921">According to his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the period, the 1960s and 1970s, widely distributed as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also seen it in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what it is actually working in this report, namely to the horrifying sexual abuse and the nonviolence at the preschool, are the free coatels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There you're already wondering if there were not more to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media were waiting for him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many people who have never understood him have never been eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report deburdened by Georg Ratzinger in every regard!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse during the Regensburger Domain was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed some processing or fellow workers with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confidence in the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dreamed to talk with my father or my mother," "" "she said likewise to the others," "" "It was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem of lightenment of sexual abuse was, but is that most victims of shame will be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not commit parents and siblings, then definitely not a chorus, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the domestranged student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: an unquestionably student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which (Georg Ratzinger) could have had earlier findings and could have been able to wake up their perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd to assume that just him... Buben eindringable or clearer or even rather opened, than against their parents, Internet guides, trust instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is the clear result of the clear result:" "" "that occurred in the apron of affected students and / or their environment, could not be confirmed during the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free of all fellow workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictory crime, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "violent attacks" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is subjected to the "Wegener" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and devastated became a huge cluster from sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen school, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once, other antages.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were enacted and maliciously, all of them had failed to have occurred on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skepy states have to rule.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the Domspatzman grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was, like most witnesses, the subject "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzist grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline, but no sawdistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were estimating the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases combine even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the allegations still remains to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods, in which the states were reported on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and was responsible (such a witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger closed the ears at the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In it he shows that, "that in the preschool, the test may continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">Despite the danger of negative pressure resistance, he had an urgent consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity had already been banned as test penalties in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows from us well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was too hard for him to be elusive, where the person affected could not be exaggerated or deteriorated, and where really the allowable border was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it can't say that he would have been chewed.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test was officially abolished in the year 1980, and was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principalities and taxis said in Gloria of Thurn and taxis, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about" "" "Fallouck of Anachronism," "" "so the danger that happened to today's moral units." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true of sexual abuse, who was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence in innocent children's activities, that's already far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm glad that it is finally getting started.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and Punishment, thus earchers, and to drag and ears to the hair, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a result of physical punishment, he was kept strictly on it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his incarnation has Georg Ratzinger for talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about life of his brother Joseph, so the Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a scroll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't get there, that he led there a strictest regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this too has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the demand unconditional discipline, it would probably not have been possible to form a real cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, one makes no big singer and before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-sureation.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced in their book by Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Eemann: I really met with the work on the book and Beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger again and again and again, as wonderful, humorous, deeply believing and heartfelt good people, of which one can not imagine that he could do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get to him how many former Domspatzen plant still have to keep him, 23 years after his efforts to visit him regularly - he's almost blind - and he is to treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched its life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, väterous teacher - a severe father, certainly knows what may be - but also a lovable Respectonson, to whom they still looks and honour her right now.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: everything one throws it, are educational methods that were then on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sin bock.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, was discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the counter-fields would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great contributions from Bavaria and probably still in Germany nobody would know the Regensburger domain from Germany, finally to leave peace in peace.</seg>
