gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the pyr@@ am@@ ids
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
by the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; gold relief ornam@@ ents &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their holiday , they hunt for the rapid gal@@ lop of home to the feeding home .
I had a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian career stopped again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he left himself with his family on the installation of the AL@@ RV on a horse . he didn &apos;t d@@ ull him for photo shooting .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen then also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was really convincing .
the German sports relief was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala pyr@@ am@@ ids .
at awards he will not lack of sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
state of State , Silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already cleared him .
long is the 18th winner of the national pyr@@ am@@ ids .
in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means to me a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for they are not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also awarded for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger is sponsor@@ ing the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 other leading sports athletes , the two @-@ point winner was the winner of the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , who works on Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the J@@ do@@ ka Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously of the hand of all Erhard .
many of these athletes were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ator company moved to Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held the distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - these are both Clinton and rub@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential competitors are based on the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic assignment .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosoph@@ ical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and war@@ ns before , like the state of the economy - with tax and regul@@ ators .
Clinton would im@@ press the economy to death and regul@@ ate to death , he says .
by contrast , it might be quite different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
he will drive reg@@ ression massi@@ vely , and he makes himself a wide tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for private experts and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has set certain tasks to open , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore the tax would be increased for the rich , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost right away .
the democratic application in announc@@ ing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investments programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are turned down by the state rit@@ ical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
on tr@@ ump , the internal discussions could be found .
significant differences in energy and climate policies are significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and driving the coal promotion in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
Clinton wants to expand and demands renewable energies with its investment programme , and calls : &quot; a country will produce the super@@ power of the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be there . &quot;
but not only for the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ onder fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
but at the same time , both the United States do not want to is@@ olate the international trade , but just to protect American jobs .
they are then to be paid better then , for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does not want to do in this question is not clear : once again he says : the minimum wage must wait , then he says he would not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the next months should be more likely to develop the tax policy of both bearings .
on one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to light@@ ens the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him , so the budget deficit would be even larger .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least of the rich who want to pay more taxes , and their critics say , more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby , which is not a year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he looks curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table @-@ top .
until they noted that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is Area Manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social support services in Bavaria , and among others , with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry sh@@ ing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all occupied women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - not as visitors too .
the exception is a watch@@ man before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically persecuted because of them or death , or because their families send them to Europe as well as their families . &quot;
there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they could not see any other way . &quot;
in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honour , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tugs are required for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re tells you .
here too , women would often be considered as min@@ as and wor@@ sen@@ ed in refugee accounts .
that leads to approximately 90 per cent of the women who live in the North in Munich , trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women have been so acc@@ ust@@ omed to say nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they do not trust , open to talk about the people , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not want to help , more accommodations only need for them , requested B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they were using a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , reply some with No .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are not something in shel@@ ters of governments .
in Schw@@ aben , alone , women are not separately accommodated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in the Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are several floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published by the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women can be separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated together , it may cause persistent - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower rooms should be separated and accessible for women easily , standing in the study .
how much the women may feel of this protective need , you can read on the qu@@ ay , which there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since she has spoken , there is a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new employees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant of the assistant doctors have called their union &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their disp@@ utes regarding a new treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his total advice from the beginning of September more labor measures .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been ministers to agree to the wor@@ ries regarding the contract .
in July , assistant doctors and medical assist@@ ants voted on the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Twitter , said the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would still have stayed in problems , which led to the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC executive board voted to fully re@@ ject the proposed new contract and calls for official re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today set a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to introduce a running programme for ste@@ aming workers which begins in early September .
the disp@@ utes led to the fact that in this year , assist@@ ants strike the six@@ teenth year , the initial gen@@ cies in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election of the agreed contract terms , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , headed by the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance , came back to Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana .
he distributed BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors and medical assist@@ ants , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt , said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England was forced to be eff@@ ected .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of foreign failure &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in the reception , I can &apos;t forbid that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation at most .
there was the r@@ ash , yes .
but Putin was an ir@@ p@@ alli@@ ed smile , and it sh@@ ined little warmth , even for his rec@@ eding conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an said repeatedly by his &quot; love &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have heard that would never happen worse than that .
I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm for the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable ch@@ ats showed that Russian state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first of what he mentioned in his introduction : the fir@@ ing of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow from reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ ated .
Putin shared out and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back .
the ship was even bigger , as it was celebrated by a mean friend .
the V@@ et@@ rough re@@ building is difficult to build if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a violent , unlimited attack on Ankara .
once it seemed , the Turks would bear all the bl@@ ame .
the accus@@ ations of senior officials announced that Erd@@ og@@ ans had benef@@ ited its own family of illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he cont@@ ested this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward to the front .
finally , this meetings took place only because Putin received the President of the President Erd@@ og@@ an , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear on the hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an is primarily used for all friends who can get , after spending the last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
again , terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economical moti@@ ves .
Russia &apos;s sanctions were hard - in particular , the ban of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has dropped by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resumed .
they are counting on a late summer tower of the Mediterranean .
this week , the sovereign debt of low @-@ fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is ra@@ ged on the west , since there was a response to the temp@@ ting power of power as a weak answer .
for this purpose , the persist@@ ing p@@ enny of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping on it is to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
Russian State leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he urged by the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected government organs .
this is well @-@ mentioned for Moscow , a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility , which has to change a deeper fear of rain .
the summit in this gl@@ assy palace resulted in Russia and Turkey , one as it described to me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of outside fail &quot; : two countries that ha@@ iling from the west and po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support other parties .
it might be characteristic that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference , they said that they would not have stri@@ ped out the subject .
the President of Turkey avoided this to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this .
there is no unique con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member of the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a Back@@ office role according to Chief of Staff of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for clients outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
since then the bank has been dist@@ ressed because it had been almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand R@@ BS &quot; brand have used to protect other consumer financial stamps .
she supported the international sport with millions of Po@@ unds in Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by up to the Wimbledon winner of Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initiated .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alized head@@ quarter and the stock markets are to be changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer , which will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be to our investor brand , as well as to the brand , under which our employees will be busy , since we are now more to become a bank of brands . &quot;
R@@ BS has become a global brand for the world to become a global brand .
I say now that we are not a global goals , but pursue local objectives .
each of these brands will be in their own par@@ ishes for something completely different and our staff will work under these trademarks .
R@@ BS has already told that it will not continue its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ tions of various brands in his Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical before three years , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can res@@ ume this brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about it , that it happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - there is a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am facilit@@ ated and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the le@@ vers when he takes the victory at Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ y@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ ing @-@ goat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern times , and there &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone , which only reached a few days before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tic int@@ ell@@ ect that differs him from the other in weight control room .

I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already brought 6,000 profits , if it was not just a weekend and great tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey one !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered a winner in UK almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

it was anno@@ ying .
a whole range of big tournament win , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug law .
three years ago he had earlier difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ bra@@ ve his doub@@ ts and to return to his best form .
and yet it is not a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has said that he wants to pass on competitions up to at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly reli@@ ed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a part of Putin &apos;s nar@@ row@@ est confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for the Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport affairs .
in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin said that Putin have ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary administration without speci@@ fying for reasons . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy deputy chairman since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) , he later told the head of the head of the head office ( Russian ) head office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state to bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the most eng@@ aging Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on TV in television , both men had said that the Chief of Staff to be back on his own request .
but despite the reason for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially in the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power here ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once had ended as a potential president , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - over@@ threw big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are cited on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said &quot; it &apos;s true that I had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , I could almost say this very complicated item - you could almost say to confi@@ dential over four years .
as it happened , I &apos;ve been chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ ary administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ onal Service ( FS@@ B ) , which appointed K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people who he trusted in most .
once it was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V could be President of Russia by Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister , before he became President of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ land cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four lock@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs a capacity of 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of steel and 46 rop@@ es .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 and is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister K@@ eith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge over the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when construction of the Queens@@ land cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineers from a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge cover in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets to Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted to its square on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project illustrates the cl@@ asp of tr@@ inal and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last road cover and its connection with the North tur@@ m@@ wood , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land@@ side .
this was reached by pulling the Northern Zu@@ er@@ brücke in the south pass 700 millimetres south .
this was a massive and very stable activity .
massive , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be withdrawn by a gra@@ dient of about 3 % .
he@@ ats , as the toler@@ ances that the team works , they were tiny - on each side , it was only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have no luck to be alive . &quot;
three men have no luck to be alive , &quot; after they were cast off by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around for itself , and set us the worst part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w up out of their range , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at age 60 and found on a Bo@@ je without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal building and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who were cast into the waters have injured and still alive .
the boat engines had a not@@ ep@@ pl@@ ess , but they dis@@ band@@ ed in the buyer of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone wo@@ ke up today about these men .
difficult - man bl@@ inking on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously wounded .
as the police took yesterday , the 50 year old had the key to get to the apartment in order to pick up his personal things .
instead the non @-@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators cut off the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they came to the apartment , he looked twice to them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was viol@@ ated by the hand and the body .
the police could choose the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 year old , he destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ po@@ unded his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 year old wanted to calm her brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ life companion of the man .
when the two women enter the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old ble@@ w his sister to the side and hold his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds hard@@ silent apartments ?
the SPD and its green : investors are expected to be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 favorable apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; Hand@@ book concept &quot; to the next meeting .
but dispute is programmed .
first line is about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartment ?
one arrangement is missing until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD parliamentary president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to be considered a social @-@ peak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can however also arise in stock .
the major dispute in the town hall , however , is as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to build investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent , but 20 percent of the apartments can be used as a social @-@ level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new town@@ house @-@ building programme , which will cost millions of costs and will have to be financed to inc@@ enti@@ ze .
the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the frac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as a few regulations .
the Left is still ste@@ ady har@@ sh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of this , the Brat@@ mann , has a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
the concept concept is implemented , which provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program still stands completely : for the approximately 1260 new apartments that are supposed to be built @-@ in .
but how to compare the loss of another around 1300 favourable apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , as planned for action , Nicole Palm , should now be deduc@@ ted from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the West town .
on a blow , the problem could solve .
because in the western city , at the end of the year , the end of Fri@@ sten .
around 1800 apartments can be found there in the price of cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner , the Hou@@ sing companies do not want .
because the number of social life in the western city is dra@@ stically raised , it is removed from the aim of the so @-@ called stamina .
there should be no more concentration of social sh@@ aking in just a few neighbor@@ hoods .
the Green Party anticip@@ ates that it will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a broad majority must be the CDU with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have focused on more building sites for single family homes .
but that does not mean , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it &apos;s amazing to see how the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer go outside , but rather , prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens , was planted in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is about to pick people up from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
hence , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other .
I &apos;m going to be inspired by the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , first created for video games in the 1990s ( later made a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon will go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS as soon as they were found , &quot; photographs &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined W@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ lem@@ ma , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35.000 users , divided the Washington Post with that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of people followed up every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for the performance increase .
many public awareness campaigns on health , people want to bring in &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day actively to be able to fall , because many public messages are bor@@ ing for health and are people who look like to look .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
those who are regularly drives sport reduces his chances to treat cancer or depression .
physical activity helps by weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it takes people to do something outdoors , that fun do them .
thus , three pillars are covered by health - motion , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are m@@ ür@@ ric games that always must compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what does it mean ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier we could follow before our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
the new will lose his appeal and use the time using the time .
however , thanks to Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ates will unite in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all that immune .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on all line .
and finally , finally , Olympics .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in climb@@ s to the multi @-@ campaign titles and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ tle at the pig bal@@ ks during the individual stage of women during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , th@@ urs@@ day .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign titles and a total of the fifth , while they fixed their reputation to be the best of its generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears , as their final result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment .
this achievement is in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought up their sports types to new heights :
Bil@@ hah &apos;s domin@@ ates the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on said she said &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever seen . &quot;
it expected her last examination in Brazil , a contest , which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather much between her and a load sur@@ passed expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as a dis@@ appointment .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ poor himself , after they &apos;ve won gold and silver in the individual stage of women during the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ al repeated the first medal on Tuesday , while she was on the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , while their long way@@ mark on the top , never have planned to have the future , this is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling pass - is ge@@ ared to Latin American music , which would fit home at home outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no surplus competition any more , a winning stre@@ ak , which will hold so long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two fil@@ ming , the picture dec@@ eit@@ ed .
pig beams and soil particles - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - watched .
they took again with 15.@@ 433 on the pig @-@ beam again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her to her du@@ ck - a pure form@@ ality - and tears over@@ f@@ ade on Bil@@ al shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collection book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she was fighting for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; was a lead .
on their ground tur@@ bi@@ dity , they fell to the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ur , sub@@ du@@ ed by a com@@ eback that was sometimes des@@ perate .
what it concerns , so the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has become a new meaning of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims were shot in series mur@@ der@@ ers while listening in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since one decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ers of Phoenix , while they had heard in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rators mo@@ cked eight shots from a hand burning weapon , while on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another car , is in the report to read .
the police shared that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a prey , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of an adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at it if it is linked to four previous attacks .
all in all , seven people were killed and two further injured in His@@ panic residential areas within four months .
in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; Howard K@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , distributed at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used multiple vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they are associated with conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness shared by the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which dropped on an empty pickup truck , half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of a series of production .
investigations found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves to sound , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his age , Edmund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , on which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing about her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought I can do that .
I do not create this .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
what is not true at all -- of course , one has left out , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband became informed that Edmund von can never recogn@@ ise them , and that he could not survive this .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with a help .
Edmund could not sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year , nor can &apos;t talk .
but it is slow to progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to sing and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please have made me a little before . &quot;
&quot; we bring to him the character language , &quot; telling Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is no typical character language -- says it . Edmund has invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y has a wide range of causes : genetic similar to Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ king or the c@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say like it is the life of being influenced by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional price of a certain future .
I am constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have been asked for a long time after the forecast , because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
violent ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding there is reason for rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississi@@ ppi
heavy rainfall and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the governor on Friday to declare the emergency . it will be credited to all Saturday above all over the rain .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ ian@@ as and the South of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its sho@@ res and threatened with large floo@@ ding in extreme cases , the National weather service reported .
the governor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in contact with local authorities and assistance to the municipalities affected by the local authorities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , one speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness along the governor , shared that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa was requested for ten thousand sand bags alone .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Louis@@ ian@@ as to Saturday .
the weather service has deser@@ ted that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ ad@@ war@@ n system was employed on Friday , while the Mobile Harbour Festival continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , will reach all probability of reaching a record level .
the met@@ alized Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream in@@ flow of A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger since the rivers will flow only slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket office , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State Border , in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest booth at 09.00 at the end of Friday .
rescue teams still made people from the region of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Mississi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ves .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet from his house , has a strong increase over night .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives in the vicinity , could be warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are coming up and the waters g@@ lowed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years where she lived there , never seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have had all disabilities and he would have the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had been saved every three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated up to Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread &quot; rapidly &quot; since it was continued heavy rain , and that the authorities evacu@@ ates evacu@@ ation transactions in consideration .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground has been considerably lied with the rainfall since Wednesday .
authorities stated that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ding accounted for the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school excursions in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary transmitter WW@@ L reported that an ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which have now floo@@ ded both .
the ruler of the congregation of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were killed 72 people and seven pets saved from floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to accommodate the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the waters begin to go back , they will return back to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed , due to the up@@ stream and sand@@ back@@ packs for the residents which hope to hold water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood which we had , was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississi@@ pp , the emer@@ ald manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it rained on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful houses shall have been reported on Thursday as floo@@ ded , but on Friday there were no reported missing .
K@@ eith Town@@ son , manager at shop by Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spher@@ es , &quot; survived in Philadelphia
the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Mah@@ aj Brown as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several sh@@ uss@@ ab@@ uses , including in the L@@ ende , B@@ ein , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to hospital at consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his small body was pier@@ ced from balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ete Mel@@ ens@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy informed the transmitter that it is expected to be recovered again .
he would have supposed to begin the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is critical in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police have just identified if there could be one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators share C@@ BS Philadelphia with you that apparently came to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , who have returned to various assault ri@@ ots , par@@ aly@@ sed the tat@@ too .
it seems that it was clearly tra@@ ded for a constant struggle .
on the street , on both sides of the trail , were lying .
thus , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided police officers Anthony G@@ in@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross trainer at the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police still looks after a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I stayed under the Women &apos;s Choir Games in the Tur@@ ns and the more than a reason .
first , I &apos;ve been in the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie , &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ üd@@ in is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ kin is round , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has a black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
over the last four years , the number one under the female tur@@ ner was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas saw a surprising Olympi@@ an winner for the last Olympic Games in Gab@@ by Douglas .
now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of the three times world champion , Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but most scre@@ ened Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman , who won an individual award event for women Gold .
Mann@@ er member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man has won silver .
we will experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gy@@ ms around the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics is only four steep@@ le in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is so that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and Turner in first line in private turn@@ tables that arise from parents , accounting , travel - clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . the list can be extended as desired .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in we@@ al@@ thy suburbs that support the business .
in these clubs , Turner receive their entire training and that is for families a dev@@ il@@ ous and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both their athletes , since they started with the Tur@@ ns .
we must insp@@ ire the churches of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gy@@ ms .
I founded my gymn@@ asium of 20 years .
during my events we have offered free and affordable accommodation in Harlem for more than 15.000 people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high quality Tur@@ ns that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art and benefit .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the Tur@@ ns and that is great .
it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls .
it is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the hol@@ den of the Olympic team gold and thank you , as many young girls motiv@@ ates to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
Assist@@ enz@@ ologists would like to organize more strikes after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ er proposal
the ministers had been hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute regarding the adoption of a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Assist@@ enz@@ ologists who voted in a vote took him .
in July Hunt &apos;s plans have been revealed to en@@ forced the contract and said that N@@ HS was conf@@ used in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , the changes leading to night and weekend work to improve maintenance times .
the President of the BM@@ A Com@@ intern announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant doctors tend to the proposed contract , especially that it will heat the current account crisis and do it to treat all doctors . &quot;
for only eight weeks which still remains , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running .
efforts made by the BM@@ A to resol@@ ve the disp@@ utes ar@@ ising during the government on resistance , and sometimes on the up@@ lifting silence .
that happened in the one speaking , the Jeremy Hunt for the last month , that his door would ever be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , lift up the force and talk the concerns of the assistance of assistance . &quot;
if he does not do this , so the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform further work .
the last strike at the end of April saw a feed of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 dates before , since nur@@ ses and medical doctors were involved to grant doctors to the strike .
the ministers had been hoping to end the dispute over the revised agreement with the function of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to provide a better weekly re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ ley , Director General of the N@@ HS , urged the assistant to termin@@ ate the strike .
mor@@ ant said : &quot; labour measures do not reach any of the only little but un@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ sing and their families only wor@@ ried , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the last two months , we talked to the comm@@ ee of the assist@@ ants and respond positi@@ vely to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to concerns relating to the concerns and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - as deployment , flexibility in training , training courses and gender pay attention in medicine - a sign that was how serious it were the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the observ@@ ance of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after the authorities recommended that more people would agree more for a longer period of time .
the ag@@ ul@@ atory medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .

the N@@ HS regul@@ ators of the N@@ HS has a four years of in@@ gest@@ ion recommended to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and one quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collections of gre@@ asy material in the arter@@ ial walls , which form the pads .
when the layer breaks out , it may cause a blood cl@@ ash , causing the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots solves , it may flow through blood flow and flow the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack had to have a higher risk to have a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by getting the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the draft bill of N@@ ICE , which today has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Auth@@ orization Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to extend treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft plan recommends not the treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves electoral lies in Muslim regions
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the basis of an government report due to corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to demonstrate that widespread election was wi@@ ped out in Muslim congregations like a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es att@@ ends the police , election ob@@ servers and coun@@ c@@ ils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Commun@@ e government , which is now a ant@@ rup@@ tions of religious moti@@ fs , said that it should be permitted to set the police out of constitu@@ encies in order to safegu@@ ard in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a document with their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment , a voters must just call his name and address .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person if they vote out their electoral voice in order to prevent someone twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the media to have more access to the municipal documents and decisions of non official documents or working groups should be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for electoral lies , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial financial culture that is approaching . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral law in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the am@@ nesty mayor Lut@@ sk was supposed to be cor@@ related to the lit@@ ur@@ ei and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ en@@ an@@ eit@@ y to silence .
Rah@@ man is supposed to be &quot; his campaign based on the basis that it is the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation by one person as someone else .
Sir Eric said it was in the whole country of evidence for fr@@ aud .
he expressed particularly al@@ ar@@ ming about fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent di@@ alling code - when older members of the Muslim community had been made to people , choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the election system , including the fo@@ ils of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as a proof , pressure on the requirements of some ethnic min@@ orities have been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose from the El@@ der &apos;s will , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ez background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have such a behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ utes concerning eth@@ ical and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban , that political activists have station@@ ed documents to stop &quot; elections . &quot;
the report , which is drawn up by Ther@@ esa May in consideration also requires har@@ der registration tests to prevent the election directory for immigration and social security purposes .
options in consideration , voters before your choice after your identification .
not remove the ink on the finger of a person as soon as they were released their voice , so that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review checks of the nationality of a person to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on mot@@ ions to an automatic correspondence .
prohibition that political activists complete correspondence and env@@ elop@@ es of letters .
the police give the police to set off@@ ences for election stations .
an amendment that was facilit@@ ated by an indictment due to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
phot@@ ogra@@ fer for@@ b@@ ade in electoral stations .
request that only English in the turn@@ out stations may be used ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees will rule the rule that voters will go alone into the cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall no pen@@ alties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court made Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for the lit@@ igation on corrupt and illeg@@ itim@@ ate practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not guilty due to a number of reasons for the grounds - according to the high requirements of the criminal procedure .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; Ab@@ sin@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the Municipal Sec@@ tors of the Town .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court case in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country is considered the mother of the par@@ liam@@ ents a proud inheritance , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of electoral lies and leu@@ gn@@ ome of some authorities thre@@ aten these good reputation .

fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are given this week via the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except edge and band , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is not the only one in order to compete for Gold fighting Ath@@ let@@ tering , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you give the social media faith .
hon@@ oring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympics which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities .
the fighter and w@@ olf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
except K@@ ates double @-@ singer on the cycling circuit , many people on the internet are thinking about how a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after paintings that he looks similar to the w@@ olf of Wall Street Star in secret .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness in the social media , and gave it to hear that he looks like Leo for his childhood .
&quot; I themselves see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a long @-@ looking candle , so I hate this as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undou@@ bt@@ edly focus more in the focus : the brigh@@ tening simil@@ arity between the British far br@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with their large , expres@@ sive eyes should be a double @-@ singer for the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption acting
another user @-@ related comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and Ac@@ tor Jos@@ h Hard@@ h , which is similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ sts in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ on@@ des hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the Americans Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities
theory in the room : according to this user , there are perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares perhaps a reason
a Twitter User@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star of Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter had an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular not@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , which is similar to the create It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone is off , when he flo@@ wer@@ ed off his own views at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Freestyle lounge .
Mac@@ Donald , who was taken on board in the commentary team of C@@ BS to give more &quot; colour , &quot; it could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig .

Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ colour@@ lane twe@@ eter , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator said that the 14 @-@ year old s@@ wimm@@ ers come from China &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ?
the I@@ di@@ ot hasn &apos;t added that they were still on the show . &quot;
Ai Y@@ an@@ han from China was scientifically described in the final 4 x 200m Freestyle aff@@ le for women . &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;

it was a un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , so sorry that it happens . &quot;
C@@ BC was at the end of more than 90 times at the end of the people who have answered the B@@ emer@@ ge via Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC acknowledged and recorded his exc@@ use at more than 90 other Twitter users who had agreed on the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network was also posted fast and released a message .
we regre@@ t it right , that these statements were made and that it was possible to show them .
we have posted night quick to our spectators at the show and our followers on the social media .
in order to clear one , B@@ yr@@ ons comments rel@@ ates to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to it as person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen for@@ ging . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was deb@@ ated in the broadcast and tried to justi@@ fy his re@@ mark by telling it that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to take me for the comment I had made after the female cre@@ dible st@@ aff@@ le in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I clicked on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and didn &apos;t refer to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no abuse was int@@ enti@@ onal and I &apos;m sorry for myself . &quot;

she continues and tried four pairs of tro@@ users in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .

a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who had been at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she returned and the business left without buying them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of p@@ ants from the delivery , moved their own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t tried to find something discre@@ et place to do it - she was simply because , fre@@ ch as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ p@@ ants , before she finally decided that you had done nothing to d@@ anced and r@@ aus@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seemed not to distur@@ b that someone observed , or to think about the person who &apos;d like to buy under the circumstances that they had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how contradic@@ ting that someone would take under@@ p@@ ants with home that had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have contributed , the staff tries to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had arrived and had not been washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Che@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit saf@@ er for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you come from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn around your th@@ iev@@ es .
if you arrive from behind , then you should turn as first , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and proceed out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the gun to face your face between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the k@@ nee into the l@@ ath and turn , while the att@@ ack@@ ers are together before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward , while they set the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and turn them , so the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot .
leave the weight at the same time and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the gun from its handle , before moving forward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi prepar@@ es .
but remember that there is a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est , your money is sufficient - unless you &apos;re not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travelling Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide of his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ gone his immune system and wor@@ d@@ ef@@ lex - by taking some of the most poll@@ uted and most difficult places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel agency Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ pped its wake up on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resistance of its immune system .
prior to the check of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show us and show us what he is going to in@@ let .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results of daylight .
the thought that allows the pur@@ ge of a train toilet , who has already been used by thousands of others , may become totally shock , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked to physicians and medical professionals over the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he abl@@ ished , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by joining the world and ate independent things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to j@@ aw@@ ns of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all things in my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ lu@@ c@@ ater . &quot;
in his film , he was just right in his reputation .
the only one refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its balance sheet showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ance of the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that refused to ref@@ resh themselves after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this comes to the worst , what I have a toilet in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will check here nothing because it is inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. Wright with vali@@ o ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the fo@@ al of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer a little something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and explain the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics as well .
we led the mad Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that they ended , that we asked &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon
instead of just over the products we wanted to provide them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how they are associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information about an interesting manner .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , said : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , if he had been waiting for Ian , which I had given to him , as demonstrated by the Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things , where it was easier to bring Ian , they anz@@ ains and others , where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we have recorded some of these dirty deals on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of those questioned from lac@@ tic acid bacteria have associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain the attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that she fears not to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I &apos;m the view that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to be considered as this estate probably is considered as beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and its reputation is also .
the pair had three sons who lived meanwhile in the apartment and the police said that the terror , who had given the family had a street strug@@ gles with bas@@ eball bats , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and floo@@ ding involved .
sk@@ el@@ eton , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ o@@ cial behavior in June .
in some areas of the house that will be torn down under conditions , old gar@@ bage was found
the property , which were tra@@ ded in the past drugs , were torn into the wood industry .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be called regularly by the police
Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing was del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week violent from the property , after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to go voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours , saying that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said one of them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived with them 20 years apart and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say to the police are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow we could not sleep &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood on , because it was so quiet - that we are not usual !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that it would have been able to co @-@ operate the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called for regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ laid side of the community house tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a dis@@ grace that it is the ten@@ ant to take any responsibility for their behaviour and family , since a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step is taking into consideration the Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely comfortable and their deeds had to be seen for their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ ageous to us and have provided us the information .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neigh@@ bor &apos;s consol@@ ation and pro@@ hibit the message that the national behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had been living at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation on the ground .
workers of the house management are now we@@ aken waste mountains , surrounded by the house
in 2014 the police carried a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , Par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton received a fine of fine , after she pleaded guilty to the owner of a drug of class B in commercial view .
they claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ ein of her son Lee sk@@ don was , who came to life in 2013 with an accident accident .
after being without ob@@ d@@ ach there is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will not keep rent@@ ers who do not stick to the assignment .
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall , by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , divided a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who have taken care of their own , as well as those who have failed in such a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and national behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Portuguese air forces said today that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - strong fog and fire - as deeply flying , which restric@@ ts its view . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ an .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old sealed on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a single @-@ sided finale , &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4.4 ) .
thus the World Ranking List First took the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ ć@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
so it was clear that for the third time there would be a Chinese title of a single title in the sign of five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the movements and time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches .
they had pulled back to the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ actor on fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ma was really strug@@ gling with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent in the first set .
after that he takes the temp@@ o at the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma was not the expected gen@@ res match .

in its quarter final against the German European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ us@@ k had to be trac@@ ed back in a medical treatment that ultimately had to be content with sheet metal .

Donald Tr@@ ump spatial ″ enormous problems &quot; in election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive care@@ ers , even in traditionally con@@ serv@@ atives states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his electoral campaign in the Republi@@ can Republi@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like any concerns how correspon@@ dents reported .
after gradu@@ ating 16 rival inside the republi@@ can camp from the race , doubt the doubt grow at his success in the fight around the White House .
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ icals Christians who asked for assistance in major federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
wrong reports of false report on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed its well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can high bur@@ ns
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard in June , Tr@@ ump and his conc@@ ise in the Democ@@ rat , Hill@@ ary Clinton at the same time .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front of the front , but not by the distance that the candidate for Republi@@ can candidates are common in the federal state .
in endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview with the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he would like to stop the meeting of the Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and remember : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will do nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not good for him by the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is said to submit funds to support his electoral struggle , it should not be able to present better conditions .
instead of what , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will join forces under the poor .
Olympia : Dre@@ ger fr@@ aud at D@@ oping test
the IOC wants to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ committee in the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after an intern@@ ment test in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with in order to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ committee in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian functional function told that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a ur@@ ine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ ess Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by team management Ken@@ yan from D@@ oping control centers .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched information on the case to determine own investigations into a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was named in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has issued himself as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list of training checks of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 by Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i has become over 800 meters in Beijing .
four days prior to the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Group President Michael Rot@@ ich has been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is supposed to have informed about cash payments from his country on upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he allegedly arrested in Nairobi at his return on Nairobi .
in Kenya , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time at the IOC .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping control of the IOC in front of the Rio Olympics , the IOC was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were put into the Vis@@ i@@ ards .
in front of the summer , the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency took a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose D@@ oping control con@@ forms to the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ winning nation .
the athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
in a series of TV reports , ARD has always been dra@@ gged that D@@ oping means will be easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und finally asked for a similar study in Kenya as he had asked them in Russian athle@@ tics Athle@@ tics .
it could be proved that in this sport mode conce@@ aled and systematically d@@ op@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ic@@ couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this is a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ einer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Mary a youth space .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an Gust@@ av@@ o Dud@@ amel is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older born Mary .
she reminds himself with W@@ ehm@@ et with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
fir@@ stly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then it would be Mari@@ as personality .
she says in her song , &quot; I &apos;d Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I my Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is so clever , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she res@@ embles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ ing Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so a honour for us to work with you .
it is an un@@ pleasant person .
and Bart@@ oli are back on compli@@ ments : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in any of his moves , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece goes around pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have lost the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ en@@ ig@@ ans went to New York , and the New York population did not want to go .
these are the same topics , and they are just as dis@@ astro@@ us as at that time .

Turkey : Kurdish municipality anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who is not att@@ acking and pra@@ ising Earth , sits on packed brands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality in Germany anticip@@ ates ten thousands of safegu@@ ards from Turkey to Germany in short term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard drive of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the short term , with tens of thousands of thousands of protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an Regime also fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the &quot; World &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had stri@@ ped out from Kurdish bur@@ bur@@ gen in late months , with 500,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey on the run .
after the failed coup , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal Turks were added .
many are rest@@ art@@ ed in Europe when they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assi@@ sts refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff accused the loc@@ ating of sy@@ r@@ atic Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
to make sure , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the exhaust pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been cut off or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member .
the government urged that the Federal Government positioned itself &quot; as sharp as Austria against the Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; can also be held against Erd@@ og@@ an critics .
I feel the first time in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement is also afraid to escape many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition leaders .
the fire market as a quality supporters destroyed teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who is not att@@ acking and pra@@ g@@ og@@ ed , sits on packaged suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len , Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the newspaper under appeal to numbers of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks present the Turks already before the coup , the greatest group of asylum in Germany for political persecution .
at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and just under 29 percent of all accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this collection , do not find out the war , poverty or the ins@@ om@@ nia .
asylum provision according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so by state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where to do it &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing out of summer campaign with - and vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the focal Parliament voted already at the beginning of the year .
so far as to date , it is not so far : summer holidays , heat and land@@ rush combat - that is enclosed .
the loc@@ als which are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ists who are on the land are on Us@@ edom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no loc@@ als , so you cannot choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , fl@@ yers and fl@@ ashing the fl@@ yers in the end of the vote , only hard labour .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be able to pass over the people in the State of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern more than expected .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 , is the strongest party since 1998 , is clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ rec@@ cuts , and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral struggle , one can see from his large posters .
he travels across the country , distributed ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ds a little with people , as it already did his legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s predecessor .
otherwise so@@ cks got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the bl@@ ame on the blo@@ om of the Af@@ rec@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; We &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him now the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top @-@ edge data , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is when you meet the wrong time at the right place election campaign .
Angela Merkel has invited Angela Merkel for major documents , the Merkel Bundestag is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU reno@@ unces the usual election events on market conditions and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
that , as a Kok@@ ert , plays only an &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
even the Union also noted that you have the base the base that it must be very rig@@ orous to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the sides of the country hardly exists .
however , the Council of the CDU electoral fought against his fel@@ low@@ ites is also self @-@ resear@@ ched : &quot; you have to go there where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly dedicated campaign of campaign .
in p@@ olls , Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and only just ahead of the Af@@ onso ( 19 ) .
the SPD was clearly won with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , would like to make the leap into the country day .

B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ers .
the construction of the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are always compli@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south end time , until the end of October , all will be ready .
comm@@ enting on the construction of the construction , it is also blessed for the construction work , for example .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been abolished and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has the traffic position inside the place .
the citizens can now turn on both sides from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the feed through the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partially significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Director General Manager Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sl@@ ur@@ ks searched for themselves and rather her Nav@@ i confi@@ ded to the sign .
what resulted in fact that many trucks in residential areas were missed .
since the speed limit has not been observed , the assembly also strengthens the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable obstacles , &quot; says King who made herself a spot on the spot .
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest @-@ speed was travelling at 77 km / h in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been continued , but it has become a quiet .
for business professionals at the B 27 , it is only a small consol@@ ation that guests from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open to the road again .
in the cards , business professionals don &apos;t like to look .
but that the B 27 has led to its increase in sales qu@@ arri@@ es , everyone who asks to look through .
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end client &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that other companies has hardly been produced for the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also during the Mai@@ er Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strongest spots on the street are the most powerful .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
they lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue rose from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking had been thrown by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had only dismissed half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , the policy would have been re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the host had benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages of which surrender themselves through the restoration .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts , where something really tra@@ ded .
with all claims , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on .
after all , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
other services are now often down due to the complicated traffic control , less frequently in order to understand .
if one can &apos;t drive it , it is quite different .
according to the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the crises of BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the consequences of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the greatest crisis which has experienced its place in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
it is constantly screw@@ ed in the name of the terror attack on laws .
following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
all his proposals are politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of its new security package .
they persu@@ aded you .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also , I am holding myself .
as the Minister of the Interior , however , it was very close to him and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before leaving his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , pro@@ mul@@ gated , announced that a new security authority to worry about the cra@@ ck &apos;s neck is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU specifications on flight passenger data and ce@@ ase@@ fire .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security regulatory authorities is not surprisingly well .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second start for suggestions that have not been doing so far with the SPD : he wants to cr@@ ate sympath@@ y for terror@@ ists and Ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German Pass .
&quot; these difficult points will be difficult for the SPD , &quot; the CDU . &quot;
he still keep doing this in reasonable and ask anything , what has no chance at the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ er .
a few new ideas to be presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in : he is planning quick process for shifts and more possibilities to in@@ ward people before deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees who are brought to the country are supposed to leave their Smartphones and make social media accounts for a safety test .
at Dul@@ ce for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as such , the off@@ ences , or to remove their papers in order to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legal .
some even un@@ balanced and makes questions open .
and with some points - in the ine@@ quality treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ led for example - the question arises : what does it actually do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not so in mind that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ er@@ zburg were killed .
in addition , many people in view of the high refugee numbers are concerned about security .
and things , who employed people , let not let themselves cl@@ amps in campaign events even in electoral events .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the devices in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ certainty is great .
and yes , it &apos;s eligible to fight .
Union and SPD approaches the subject of internal safety increasingly in position .
in the past few days there went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ den@@ ess dispute over the configuration of the Federal Police , then over a safety @-@ critical ideas collection of some Unions inside the departments also need a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also strug@@ gling for sil@@ ently tones here .
from a return from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t receive anything .
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
it is not meaning@@ fully , be sen@@ sible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he have constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional , and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partner , it has to show itself still .
there is a lot of things that could cause dispute .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing itself with the subject of internal safety .
the SPD Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized first time to deal with discussions and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing the safety . &quot;
again , Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel engines , the delivery times are rising worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action , the vort@@ ex gives a term around .
Volkswagen launches its deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest bus car can still present an increase in the previous year despite its many brands and some well run markets .
however , in July the key brand VW moved primarily in Western Europe and thus resi@@ sted the total sales , such as the company divided in D@@ ax .
with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in the previous year as compared to the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China &apos;s second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries by almost a sixth .
market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weaker numbers from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there have been a shopping framework in some key markets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote applied to the withdrawal from the EU , explained a female speaker .
in the US , where exhaust emissions were first gro@@ unded , also a minus of be@@ ech is also found .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the affected number of shel@@ ters of the Lower Saxony has risen sharp@@ ly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition from 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles are be@@ ech .
Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales charts from January to July .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software application tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , the conversion of cars did not have negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car deal@@ er@@ ship the customer after upgrading a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certification , but did not say of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was announced on Friday in the business area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason be legal host@@ esses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted his German customers now a guarantee of rounded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this last Monday VW representatives were confirmed by the Federal State Department on Monday .
out of the traffic ministry , it was confirmed that this meeting was announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the regulations of my investig@@ ating commission and the KBA process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of it will not be accepted , &quot; declared German Minister President Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the warranty that a fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting does not take place , and all typical verification of relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was related to business circuits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen will see the possibility that customers coming back to a workshop in half a year after re@@ armament - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do so .
even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage caused by any other damage caused by nothing to prevent damage to any warranty claims , such as it was named .
therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is demanded of rich savings in the future - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just 139 customers that use 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Ban@@ ks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal : regular savings would have to be feared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their savings penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund as of September of private and corporate customers for deposits of 100,000 euros on tox@@ ic@@ - or daily conditions .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ski@@ pped 40 million euros for the time that they could be withdrawn from one day on the other and could not be able to explo@@ it this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are within me at the central bank account and cause 0.4 % cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said banking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the cost has been decl@@ ining according to the caus@@ al principle .
the cash is easy to leave in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four accidents , I would not have the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers have understanding and changes to other investment forms .
only few people emigrated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative society declared that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically fe@@ as@@ ible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .

a ban@@ ker said on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a client which has a little bit sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous in the fortune . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Dest@@ ination records : who actually purchases sound boards ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before using the commentary part , in order to overcome it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ ant@@ it@@ ational age of men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement leads from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most varied re@@ formation of records are not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which would like to welcome the curios@@ ity of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a board are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
there is no hormon@@ es by Hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older record players retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this Blog is an news report on TV would follow me while I carry out my camera in the midst of a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit before I stand to stop my hands and something like : &quot; so let &apos;s throw us a closer look . &quot;
so let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart so@@ cks the heart of So@@ H@@ os in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the building where independent sellers have been based - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record transactions .
I would probably ask the camera when I was able to switch the camera for the next part in which I am standing in immediate proximity to different men in such stores , try to assess your age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I turn from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : eight male aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men aged middle age , one woman probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to complete the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
this record plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by myself ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not aff@@ ord to buy them when she had been selling and again items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late &apos; 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who want to buy records are rather pet@@ alled and like to spend alone time , and add : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that meets it meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy their old boards again .
from the discussions that I have led , people are usually buried around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy again their disks . &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to a plate on a certain type of age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds into a business like Ph@@ on@@ ica , to realize that disk shops offers a soo@@ thing community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers cut off the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel dis@@ band@@ ed from the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of objects , happy youth deposits .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of a flat stack .
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a board last month is not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a plate does not own record players .
at this point of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I have a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ ut@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone first came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record board , so I &apos;d like to make it into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a large percentage but it definitely happens .
more productive @-@ loads , less music cl@@ assy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the younger people , not older who will not come slowly .
F@@ opp that has dedicated to the sound tops almost a whole floor has a colorful audience , as I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women intermediate age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ called stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ os and sex@@ ist Pop instead of experimental jazz . it is good to see such diversity in the customer .
none of them looks especially visible , but nour@@ ishing psychological trau@@ matic are hard @-@ adjustable if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in business and considered the vari@@ ance for sale for sale .
it rather makes a man@@ nequ@@ in as a big one .
they don &apos;t deser@@ ve a lot , hence the collection of records are not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ ous@@ ed si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of disc lovers : urban Out@@ fit .
while I give the licence to guess the Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young te@@ amm@@ ants who group@@ ed for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left is a staircase outside of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can see them - maybe because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to summar@@ ize them .
it is pure &quot; plate @-@ art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the sector , and some customers in the depths of So@@ os can be sent to more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money , even the one that is most for luxury objects such as boards .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record business in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and disk bur@@ dens , who exist in reality , disk shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en exist un@@ considered .
these people are thought to work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the st@@ roll through the stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they keep the star@@ ring sight of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of middle aged men .

French Court re@@ jects the proposal about demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais who live in tens of refugees .
during a trial hearing this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary stores within the camp goods , from cigarettes to Ener@@ gy@@ h , sell , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places would be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and that a fire and physical risk .
humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , will not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in stock .
they also resulted in that the provisional shop and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but spati@@ ally found that the concerns of Cal@@ ais &quot; pre@@ fecture are &quot; absolutely downstream . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extreme prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas had quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the Lower re@@ mor@@ sel was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café in the camp , which is meant to be heated and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum seek@@ ers for hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in stock .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was stated that the closure &quot; would be a cat@@ astrophe , one of which are the youngest eight years old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle lives increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .
despite Olympia Dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fierce
despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic period , Rad@@ benef@@ i Tony was not going to get interrupted by Tony Martin .
&quot; I keep on the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and compete , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro .
he did not have a statement for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was honest , it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must rest in peace , which are the reasons for de@@ ac@@ orn .

other people looking to play video games is a huge advantage - it also wants to benefit Microsoft .
the technology group bought up the start @-@ up Be@@ am based on this hobby .
as much money for the tak@@ eover flows , Microsoft does not share with it on Thursday .
Be@@ am went to the start in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can look at other games , but also engage myself .
for example , they can give up the players missions and preparing their enemies , as well as equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany R@@ aser must be set up on the next generation of speed meters : in different countries , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ er will be particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic en@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used as an example of un@@ affected areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to san@@ itation bridges with temporary speed limit there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bl@@ az@@ er for compliance with the speed limit .
but a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or to be cum@@ ber@@ ing .
the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring mode , the case data is encrypted using a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously via multiple tracks .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments as well as for driving units after time , passengers and vehicle class can also be monitored .
you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer hook .
in order that it is not easy to clear , it is lowered into a measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and by the way will disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system will protect the Bl@@ icky from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
even foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by using Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive Great Britain of the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a rup@@ ted stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated in Rio at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in the handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , back on the back , line and ro@@ asting power to win Gold - their first Olympic Medal every color .
the defeat of the Silver Medal was sl@@ ammed due to the non @-@ bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could be trac@@ ed back to them in the finals .
but Fi@@ ji had sm@@ itten with this form a 15 @-@ man team in best form .
it might be a comfort for UK - but it probably won &apos;t that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow gets a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben Ryan , the former chief apostle for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind him .
eight years ago she lost Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here it just lost one .
this mud will do so , but progress is astonishing .
Fi@@ ji began to be wonderful and caused the GB@@ S attacks of fun .
it felt for the Captain Tom Mitchell and co . it would be running in running buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner of the sur@@ f@@ encing .
with another four minutes of playing game Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , added another attack from the right corner that he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly made the ball .
a sharp bend of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third goal , but it only got Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the rest@@ art and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ pped by other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , as Fi@@ ji were born to play the 7 , while UK still is da@@ isy .
it is that way too .
GB introduced basic changes to half time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for the four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running through a brilli@@ ants intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long been in favour of the South African cons@@ ulate , whose fans sang and dance on the tr@@ ams .
it was not difficult to see the cler@@ ical approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame replaced the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff war@@ med , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the GB kno@@ cked up into the lawn .
in the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated a semi @-@ final match with 20 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals and the United Kingdom had a tight half match match from the race - UK &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half after the front , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ wear and scored one gate among the positions in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony des English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the profit - and thus won the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fighting with the cancer of the train@@ ers to make the rowing victory
there will be no more ty@@ pe@@ al@@ eres gold than for these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 tough h@@ ieve that go down in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was there as they were the second Olympics in the bi@@ er without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter stra@@ ined bet , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es , which leads over the surface with the elegance of tears , which does not reflects the nature of the Arc de Tri@@ umph@@ al .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on to content hel@@ pers which make the difference and it was no more useful than the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had a bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a worst situation .
it changes a little to the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky enough to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin what the inter@@ ruption of a minimum , if that could be the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was at the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ fusion of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who was able to talk about something else than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was a cent@@ ur@@ ion at the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in an attempt in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin have worked out .
it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks go to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I would not have a better person to work or wish for a better co@@ aches .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to take it up .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something wrong .
we wanted a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , going out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before it will make decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall .
now it wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that I was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity :
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ age Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ inge pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of some time ago in the original edition of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the Water Forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia rested .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group was &quot; Bavarian &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who lived for 31 years in the forced staff , including 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n is funding about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants each year .
member congregations are the churches of Kirch@@ no@@ a , Breit@@ brun@@ n , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further cities and communities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller ceased as a water@@ bed in 1985 and was named Director of the Pur@@ ge Association in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work about office and organiz@@ ational activities , the budget information , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency par@@ agra@@ phs on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she named the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the farmers in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , and the re@@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ formation of water pipes .
I have no breast@@ plate and have always taken new changes because water lives and water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , they blessed G@@ öl@@ ze , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived for the purpose of the water @-@ purpose association as it would be its own company .
only a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group on the nit@@ rate survey in front of the district of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised his wife Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water , and he was a faithful kiss .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a high point of view , he called the fountain of the fountain and the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings of the forced association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use of the pipe was on the sky@@ scra@@ per on the 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained once again , because they filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sle@@ eper .
the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who comes from Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s succession .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man closed on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( county Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner@@ ships and injured them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called himself with us , and said to have shot his companions to be shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the police officers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no information about the kill@@ ings or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but she confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a killing . &quot;
&quot; more than we do not say &quot; said a pol@@ ishing by police in Lübeck .

steel - lumin@@ ous view for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lin@@ Industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed at an additional cost of millions .
financial impacts , threatened by the sector from the green power boost , are from the table .
the German Minister for O@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the German general newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) will remain in the liberation of renewable energies in the German steel industry .
&quot; I &apos;m really pleased that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to ask steel producer , gases coming from the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry industry , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission to talks with a competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ re .
the altern@@ ators in the steel works will be replaced , all an EEG ratio of 20 percent .
but these will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on their own production .
this means that the status Quo of the current control will largely be established .
special significance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more need to follow &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when the reform of the emission standards are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable pricing pressure in Europe since the financial crisis of 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the situation continues to expand than the world &apos;s largest producers of China in view of the weak@@ ening native demand of steel on the global market .
European manufacturer t@@ oss Chinese steel concer@@ d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
one cat@@ ching import duties on import effect , for others , economic prospects have collap@@ sed in China .
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price is recovered .
the German Bran@@ chen@@ pri@@ mus Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp continued to be careful on Thursday .
last , the prices would have been stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp would not have been able to exclu@@ de the works of single works in the process of closed works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry in the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year as well as the German unification of steel .
following a short increase in May , the quantity now returned the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year the production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association calcul@@ ates in the coming months thanks to an improved order amount .
community , Spirit , Health : singing the Sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching position , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old singing in an elderly choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sing it is balanced , cheer@@ ful and a total of living , she says .
at the same time , she is doing something good for her health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for seniors , &quot; says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German retirement League .
most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
together , senior social contacts can sound and maintain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often the social and family structures often resol@@ ve , a ch@@ orus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in your choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss and learn to learn about the others - a choir is a very special form of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler believes .
for doing , senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who calls his lung regularly , also in everyday life not as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Association of the Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , common S@@ ingen had a lot of capacity , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explained .
L@@ enz is frequently observed that singing or listening songs in older people are awak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , even de@@ ar@@ tery disease wor@@ ms itself in long @-@ lying events .
in addition to singing , a special achievement is demanded , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focus on their own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone do not only prac@@ tise on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition by singing through singing in ch@@ orus , h@@ ac@@ kler believes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em is also growing through the singing in the choir .
even to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience is strengthening .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he mean , little talent , av@@ enge L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 sin@@ es people who hear , when once a tone goes beside it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if anyone gets from the acquain@@ t@@ ance in a veter@@ an army , you can simply connect yourself .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
who would like to sing together in a Church choir , can turn right to the church or the church leaders .
many senior choirs can be found on the Internet .
if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask help with the internet .
those who want to sing , should be united to a choir , av@@ enge H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has some liberation - that applies to any age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely to k@@ itt@@ ens than k@@ ater on Schre@@ ie of the Jung@@ le
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover , which effect the call of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
at their surprise , the occup@@ ants did not leave the male , however , they kept in the difference to the females always equal .
female cats may recognize the path@@ o@@ unding of cad@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the ten@@ ding of the little ones .
they react around ten percent faster on lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens who found themselves in serious trouble , such as scientists from veter@@ inary Academy and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the herds of k@@ itt@@ ens - but still the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently the acoustic differences between the r@@ ushing of less and strongly er@@ reg@@ ated young are either perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of significance , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ itative study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; published on this Friday .
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and sound level of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ es differs with the courtesy of their help of their help .
a total of nine adult males and eight female subjects were seen from the pig@@ gy@@ back of the MH@@ H .
for three minutes were played by the c@@ box and were separated from the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens who were additionally lifted up .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even those who had no own offspring re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this ru@@ fe played the very well @-@ known k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be in@@ born or continued with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male re@@ acted at all , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist .
in the past scientists have already resear@@ ched several times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
there were also some studies that women react to inf@@ ant , quite like it were mothers or not reported the Bi@@ ologist in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Southern door is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ an .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
an important football game will take place for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey .
before Du@@ eling of the arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .
already in July , after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the exceptional attempt in July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ alization should not be imp@@ aired .
however , this does not apply to those who are suspected to have the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
thereby the football is not binding before the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ward the Public Prosecutor issued an arrest warrant .
thus , in the meantime , the South Africa has been accused of having been accused of being member of a terrorist group .
the Sü@@ ver should be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although it initially applies for 90 days , the state of emergency is still valid until October , in fact that on the life of most Turks , however , it is as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy gu@@ ards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sport is - like the whole country - split in peace and fo@@ es Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the Workers club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
but what the Turks had dramatic experience in the history of the Turks , the strict withdrawal of military coup is stri@@ cken mu@@ te .
there even fans dar@@ ed themselves - no matter whether you beat the heart of Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al winner &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be back to St. Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
in its sporty value , the Cologne hall in the expired season was proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his corporation .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; che@@ ered on him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season to an excellent way and secured the cup .

the cup was the only possibility to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as the game was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who served with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ho@@ en@@ nig the base for the 14th title .
this is the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the AC Florence was under contract under the contract and had only been announced to the coup attempt at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as to return to the political situation in the country according to his EM &apos;s holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario would come to us , he must say it only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club@@ house F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ gs in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
another led athle@@ tics @-@ sin@@ ner can only laugh at that - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic D@@ oping is chosen as before the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had felt after a d@@ oping lock her start@@ up just before playing , was withdrawn from their start ( 100 yards breast ) .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ b@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a putting smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her show with her performance .
when noted that they will not get gold , the audience broke out in a jub@@ ilee .
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m s@@ quad@@ ron / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in Athle@@ tics .
he was imprisoned twice for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his ban , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has even been running faster than before , he &apos;s over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to leave a six @-@ month lock after having been proven by the pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after a severe to@@ oth@@ ache , she defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion of 2012 , world championship was tested positive in 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 with a positive loss of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the in@@ gest@@ ion and was closed for six months .
the four most far th@@ rows in this year go to the account of the big gold@@ favor@@ it@@ in .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 and has been closed for 21 months .
a means to have been responsible for penis enlargement is responsible , s@@ eu@@ e Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ole , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were subsequently recognized as many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title nine years later , after testosterone was diagnosed with testosterone .
meanwhile , 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ titles in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Sports Tribunal .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m it is on rank two of the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world female ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or and Gold@@ favor@@ it@@ in was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of associated supplements were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran already on July 13th .
Bom@@ b error in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood up with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday early .
she suffered schn@@ it@@ ry and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this .
her home journey is planned for early September .
whether you have further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ild@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stood in relation to the local authorities with the local authorities , as a cut@@ away .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok Hu@@ a H@@ in , two bombs were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night .
according to the police , polic@@ emen were killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up , and there was a further human being killed in the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular seaside train Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following police properties .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , there explo@@ ded another bomb that killed an urban staff .
the demol@@ ition was put into the air according to the authorities in front of the prec@@ inct of coastal police in the air .
after all , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ ild@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
one related to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army ener@@ ge@@ al Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday to journalists .
&quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
it was too early to express itself about possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is , however , for the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern to the attacks , which is typical for the bomb attack in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the terrorist attacks were not associated with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age that restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one , however , assumes that the bombs were laid by pursu@@ ers of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities have received confi@@ dential information on the upcoming attack in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and the places were informed .
be un@@ clear that group behind the suggestions .
the police pointed out its officials around the country to enh@@ ancing security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement park .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , yet they do not judge any tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason of the reason bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommended to provide the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( security level 3 ) approved for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be not necessary trips in these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) is used for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversial referendum on Thursday and Friday , a few days before a controversial referendum on Thursday .
in the next few years , the military has also dre@@ amt of the military .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs be a attempt to push over chaos within the country , while the country is moving toward stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ aval , keeps himself too good to have the kingdom return to stability and order .
however , it did not succeed in the military in the extreme south of the country of the country , which had been in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
a year ago , in Bangkok , there were also 20 people killed in Bangkok during a bombing of a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack in the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is the vis@@ or of the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection .
after several provincial offices , the constitu@@ ent will also be put under observation in the Confederation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; holding points for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ ent President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants are diff@@ use of Islamic faith , or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ist@@ ical manner .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
she turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity through strange . &quot;
constitutional drug in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority joined the decision in the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where she stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extrem@@ ists try to address them with young people , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ist Islam@@ ists as well as in fact .
this is not an extra advertising for his own thing .
the propaganda shall appeal to people .
young people are due in a special way .
that is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently , there had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type can only be relevant from a certain point .
it insi@@ sts whether the relevant party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes their destination and is so extreme .
the decisive factor is that such persons might have the influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a look at the significant increase of tim@@ o stra@@ ins and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new rights in this context .
but in recent years we have found that it may be legally binding structures .
there were the Group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite true that other legitim@@ ate groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee people or attacks from other right @-@ border moti@@ fs .
but a Europe @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of sp@@ ouse is not recogn@@ is@@ able .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social nets .
concerned , Ma@@ ate wor@@ ried about that there were many over@@ lap on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying thing .
many of the o@@ susp@@ icious attacks on asylum in attacks are not known as crime , politically motiv@@ ated off@@ ender or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed atro@@ cities who had nothing to do with the extrem@@ ist who might have been politically in@@ different or to the example of the CDU , SPD or Left , which is then ra@@ dically slo@@ ped by far @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international law association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ presented countries .
since in Ethiopia the most athletes are running , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the turn .
some media identified him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ hal@@ e . &quot;

his time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres fre@@ il , there was no role played .
compare with &quot; Eric the panel &quot; have also been drawn .
on the occasion of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i run for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from A@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 metres fre@@ il alone .
in fr@@ en@@ etic , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old came to swim during eight months before the Olympic and had never completed a long distance prior to the competition .

two of the in@@ mates suffered heavy injuries to the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travel business from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their information according to a opposite L@@ aster which took part in the counter@@ way .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ ps into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ I / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the charges per cubic meter of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wer@@ age of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wer@@ age fee will then increase again , if necessary improvement measures are necessary .
according to a relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that , during the approval of the budget with Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that se@@ wage sub@@ cover@@ ages are running .
the Kaz@@ endorf Market is required due to legal basis to operate the plants covering .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ im have to lay down in the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Management Herbert Schmidt on the panel , it was necessary to re@@ stim@@ ulate the fees for the se@@ wage plant in the market community .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - or covers from the previous calendar period are to be compens@@ ated .
in all three se@@ wer@@ age increases , Schmidt thus formed that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage plants with a very low waste container , that fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would be gra@@ ci@@ dated .
in addition , the se@@ wer@@ age should be slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
furthermore , in the past calendar period with all three plants were not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair expenses in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for cat@@ ches , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp .
Schmidt demonstrated that in the se@@ wer@@ age , Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical ventilation system due to any damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sh , the nearly 20 year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond cl@@ utch L@@ opp had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge and an additional v@@ ents can be installed in order to maintain the water requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the maintenance and maintenance costs came to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 is still below the current level .
Stein@@ häuser clearly pointed out that at low water waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully beat . &quot;
in addition , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants had spar@@ ed the se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years .
the situation for the plants will continue to continue after view of Stein@@ häuser in the duration of the duration , especially since you could not expand the supply area of the se@@ wage Association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al by these installations , because it is concerned about de@@ classified facilities .

when this week maintained a filter for several users who gave them sl@@ otted , false teeth and ri@@ pped che@@ eks , there are some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ns . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if this repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y dropped to a larger problem , that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indign@@ ation were spread throughout Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ boards , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was thought in homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ent that the rac@@ is@@ ance had experienced , remin@@ ded the filters of in@@ viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other loans the An@@ ime compar@@ es .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Au@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ eter about the photos have been widely used , that the filter &quot; Viol@@ ating and House was said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ protected , but that the yellow light has been drawn into the most valuable extreme .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that the cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate crosses .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diet and integration process , from meeting rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment that we keep all in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - those who are in race like their older players - could rather expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture produced , it is a lot more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u , who works as product man@@ ag@@ erin and engineering works for medium , works their Snap@@ chat account to delete others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that r@@ all@@ ying con@@ dens@@ ation claims a lack of diversity in the setting group practices in Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ised the great part of white , only male guide and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel good to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , an appeal to the Snap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company will not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it &apos;s Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokesperson , the company has recently established a staff responsible for focusing on the subject of population groups and an internal integration process .
Zh@@ u said in turn , that they will leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military management of IS@@ IS secret service information , states Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command modi@@ fi@@ able information to draw a optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria as it allowed the actual states to place in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of Armed Forces , Secret Services and of the military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence Service , the reported that their ass@@ ess@@ ments towards American efforts were changed in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News news information , which were generally accepted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , identified a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism , as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers will suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership of the Centre in Cent@@ Com are enough to reach the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct notes to indicate that government peaks below Obama indicates how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre @-@ laws , a optim@@ istic image of the threat of Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements prior to Congress clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military return from Mos@@ cons@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much clear . &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can convention from Kansas , in a position statement .
from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the mid @-@ year of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the News @-@ Service reports to run down the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in Life after they played that analysts were wor@@ ried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation will be continued .
in addition , Cent@@ Com reports are reports by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense in G@@ ange .
the Democratic Members of the News Service Act published their own findings on Thursday that cons@@ ulted with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com acquired a exc@@ essi@@ vely restricted process for the creation of downstream service ass@@ ess@@ ments to I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi safety services , the highest ranking of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , known in a statement .
this process , as Mr. Schiff , delayed the publication of downstream @-@ service reports , &quot; the mur@@ al under analy@@ st and &quot; delivered little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no references to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intervention in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ ses regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress took place on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times reported investigations carried out by the Pentagon Secretary of In@@ spec@@ tor , according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress while the investigations of the General Assembly would be still in the genes .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important issues of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have agreed upon the question of a successful air campaign amongst American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year however , however , did not leave the question , while President Obama can rely on the central command of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism regarding the secret information concerning the Islamic State does remember dis@@ rup@@ tions of more than 10 years ago when Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ kers , a font on the recommendations of many analysts , looked at a little time on the basis of the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ kers after speci@@ fying government agencies that had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provis@@ ionally refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
this knowledge has not been published , but the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ nation commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the Legislative Assembly for its exc@@ essive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced with the Central Command through Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with great Britain .
one day after she shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans had won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in memory .
however , the Americans know them : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic and are equally unbe@@ aten in their group with the British in their first place finish against Japan after 2 @-@ 0 victory .
great Britain and the United States will hit the first round of the first round on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first fin@@ isher is a little longer from the way which leads the other group .
as always the game play out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex by their success story , four years after she landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in their hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because it couldn &apos;t qualify for the box .
then came the year 2012 , where she went away for her and her team .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was created , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we had not the work to work in London that we have now .
we can rip the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly , and kept the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the sh@@ allow ball over the left flan@@ k , moved into the middle and lu@@ ck@@ led the ball to the Americans to give the American a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to now book a gate in any of the previous games .
she has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and in@@ sof@@ ter , a fast relay between competition and str@@ uts .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect from the wrist@@ band to the runner @-@ up to the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ un@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have been extensively sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and Well @-@ being @-@ being advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ use .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow , there are sports types that are not widely recognised : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the breasts and may have a long time .
but if I should make a modest arguments for my particular favourite , then you let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the re@@ bo@@ under .
although the trampoline jumping is already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , it became the last 16 years so sp@@ elled that many people I asked , didn &apos;t know that it is a Olympic @-@ port .
this may also be regional Ign@@ ore .
although the United States sent athletes for competition , it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping competition , and has had an athl@@ ete , who made it up to the final round in 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese , and the Canadian women for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear to a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous lem@@ urs of its never to end up - but also the gra@@ zie of the turn@@ around and diving , which combines two sports types , which un@@ ites it essentially .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which is as much as &quot; dive board . &quot;
the winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves ( turning , hat@@ ch and sal@@ tos ) before landing at the feet .
they will be judged according to the official Olympic programme according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go straight forward in their journeys to gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go back and down , down@@ wards and down on the playground .
you do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast another example : the world or the Olympics .
the goal oriented trac@@ ing is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ less - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I myself watching these games as a little ti@@ ring .
of these , the trampoline offers a breathing .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ ts , seem@@ ingly heavy to@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go down , then down@@ wards , then go back to top .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during the practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal of no firm@@ ament in the distance , only the dreams , elegant lift of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the Competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and du@@ cks of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC is om@@ ni@@ ated as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably will see in general tum@@ ult .
if the consciousness increase is achieved only through the Ang@@ ing and the obj@@ ectors of male athletes , the same - how it fores@@ een the male US Turner at the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expected to Alexandria up new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ esters &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a For@@ ward of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators to demand political changes in Ethiopia , beat the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that eigh@@ ty prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solo@@ ist of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government continued the country and expanded more and more .
last week , thousands of people attacked the streets and fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was in@@ hal@@ ted according to human rights organizations .
witnesses gave us that polic@@ emen shot down on an un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
in circulation , over the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the UN Authority of Human Rights requires an ongoing investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to meet this land and will even become more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
U.S. military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians together to fight terror against the region , in particular in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new extension to the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are normally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything as a model for democracy - the human rights organisations have continually led the repression through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereas dis@@ sidents were effectively transferred to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , or put into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you submit people and do not need any other options except to protest it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ y@@ m Tes@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ y@@ m Tes@@ co , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest .
a generation protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from soil utilization to the lit@@ ge@@ y in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a far critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now serves 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the ten@@ sions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this h@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of lives .
analysts predic@@ ts that separ@@ ati@@ sts , such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were able to explo@@ it more or less in recent years , could dep@@ loy the tur@@ mo@@ il and to come back .
several factors explain why feelings of deteri@@ oration after years of age in front of the surface is now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : Smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian people were able to communicate with the social media , since cheap smartphones have increasingly been more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , especially in protests , people can communicate many people still on the internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ian stated that they were among themselves protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ ni@@ as in Ethiopia .
O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
the am@@ har@@ as , which are cultivated in Ethiopia predominantly of Christian high countries , are in the politics and economy , while they explo@@ red the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat villages .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the greatest protests were held in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the Un@@ rest is Death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel guide , was until his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical Genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly compens@@ ated in that early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contrac@@ tors to make opponents and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this fundament@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians , new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was talking to such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested by the government according to information forwarded by the government and then stolen from the government .
while the following Raz@@ icia , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this period of distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively fast .
development experts lob@@ s Ethiop@@ ians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new extension technology , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress at the poverty control .
but obviously it does not have the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ sal of Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it accepts a dangerous ethnic pattern .
the last month of protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , of Tig@@ ray led shops and the hat@@ red against the tig@@ ray is always usual in the social media .
analysts say that the protests swe@@ ets the US and other western allies in a separate position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the nearby Somalia , even if they recently announced that she closed this base .
while the west aims to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to join its alliance in an already vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his asser@@ tion Obama to be &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that rel@@ ates his campaign by breaking his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication gives new questions about the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to communicate whether he was able to communicate and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings up his fel@@ stre@@ ites who ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in which the actual position , which he could not have meant .
after he made the suggest@@ ion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made back to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really was not intended to interpre@@ t the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is simply sar@@ c@@ ous .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said within a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the statement somewhat weak@@ ening it , remin@@ ded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , wanted to know the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism fell to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling re@@ frac@@ tions on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held spe@@ ech@@ es for economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject again .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t would lead suggestions to higher tax and that he was bor@@ ing to bor@@ ing their speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism , when he meant , the Russians should h@@ acking Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ ist . &quot;
this method allows to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic limits in politics to post@@ p@@ one and then back as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods , such as certain messages from his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction falls off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to stop his statements , so that they can be interpreted in different ways and wise .
instead of the tone to shar@@ pen@@ ed the Presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump received an even corro@@ sive sound , because its re@@ frac@@ tive values went further .
a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics to understand his testimony or to understand his recommendation .
but while he strengthened himself in the focus of the attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps li@@ ze brought his loyal mit@@ er into the un@@ comfortable situation to be standing , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may be his testimonies also .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , a former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , was the great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps testimony to Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Barack Obama was an almost unknown , small organization that he called her back@@ grounds , completely false and therefore , because he withdrew troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government minist@@ ered by Obama , when Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , it is IS@@ IS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East to control the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them off , on every one of his words and to be pres@@ et against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t say it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies than just another evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price from the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a Brazilian café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi was free , but for 15 years a good coffee is ser@@ rated .
of course , the prices made from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie set up the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people be@@ aded the city as the last loss in a gene@@ tically modified town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ ause is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but when New York is changing , there is also curios@@ ity .
a re @-@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened the last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original site .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
Cisco Rodri@@ guez &apos;s new owner , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new accounts , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for excav@@ ations bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he led a new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ants such as cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there are natur@@ alist bowls .
the café is not served any beer , there is fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez showed that he noticed a complete current of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced through the prizes of William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and visited the Ver@@ b .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to itself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave it a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was at the coffee and on the culture in the Ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they were Coff@@ ee@@ able on that day instead of their usual rush , a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea ordered , who is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and faithful client since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ter the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after seven , every day like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he was not a p@@ enny that the soap business has taken off the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is indeed to produce a special soap for clubs with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of coffee .
&quot; I think we will still talk on their offer , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish @-@ Polish menu and Rodri@@ guez told you that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the Café is expanded into a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new Café opened , Wh@@ itt feels that the step@@ ping of the location and the beast felt a new coff@@ ees like a return home .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the prim@@ itive food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President Franklin Del@@ ano took his lunch on the Oval Office .
President Roosevelt played a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a little modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pu@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the living in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their newest cooperation , &quot; A permanent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ t@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ bite in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the business since the stock market crash of 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh oil bath with olive barrels , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn took with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
when the repor@@ ter was set in wood , this was the pair for a discussion about the meal in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared out of an ingredient and a very cheap which provides access .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male rock work and it was served freshly baked past@@ ry for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
there were the Americans who sent foods to the hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the ways with which the country went on to be no more the s@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a time in the food for the Americans , a centr@@ alized theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
similarly , the new bud@@ get@@ di@@ cap : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and cass@@ ettes were found on basic food , the c@@ ash@@ ore as &quot; wonderful species , food waste recovered , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , because Kö@@ che un@@ app@@ et@@ ite ingredients could hide in a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by low dry fruits .
the meat , which was the heart of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury .
independent mixtures were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutr@@ itious desire before taste or even healthy kitchen had stood .
during her research for the book which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that ep@@ och , baked onion with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no popular addition in the lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the laundry recipes .
as never before or since then , the household econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stanley , Chief of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the Ess@@ ential hab@@ its of the country .
by using recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary sp@@ ies &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical le@@ aks .
in particular , reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizen , as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peas@@ ant kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ y like the million@@ th heavy man of the world , which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded dining room and took a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderful real@@ time .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ise with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present day of a hou@@ se@@ keeper with no interest in tast@@ es caused by wife Roosevelt wrote that the White House prepared the most durable food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , to deal with food , was rejected once the country was back on the legs .
the legacy of legacy is on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food@@ stu@@ ffs .
the couple had better understood at the writing of the book of Zi@@ egel@@ mans in law in law - for example , as they did not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a wind incident .
after the plate turned off at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ ess@@ ert that ate President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a usual trick , a modest name was to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no local cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each one di@@ pped a spo@@ ons of spo@@ ons in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E won three times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ des he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to man in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died himself with a bom@@ bed attack in the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which saved almost 60,000 people according to the image newspaper .
29@@ 00 volunte@@ er set their own life on the game to draw people out of st@@ icky buildings and to make their first aid during the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him at an 11 @-@ hour rescue of infants from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbolic figure in the hor@@ ror of the war .
but as heroes , he never saw himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar himself fell victim to an attack in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicopter have cast four versions above the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from bre@@ aths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the remains of the bomb so that not children to play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kill@@ ings of the Assad regime would meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest ed@@ dy is nearly 400 years old
less sight .
Greenland usually occur only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get its offspring only with 150 years of offspring .
in the Greenland on the ground floor of the North Atlantic , it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 meters in an hour .
only when it comes down , the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this of lon@@ el@@ iness made lifestyle seems to be a sponsor for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ elem@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock , this life expectancy which means for sp@@ ed@@ ules a world record .
in fact , the theory of evolution of evolution already suspected that Greenland was st@@ ony .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice Sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the surface only in the winter .
about the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know little .
her tim@@ el@@ age is sufficient for her time , when they equi@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transmitter .
these shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed the pine bones of a young ice .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol@@ s at the bottom of the ice cream and seek Cad@@ aver , which are tor@@ mented from higher water layers to bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as cat@@ cher from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest H@@ ai was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ meter measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens core of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of eye lens is already formed before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are contained in it later no longer .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore be in the early 1960s , as a nuclear tests , larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere decreased .
in the length of 220 centimeters in length , the lens core contained a low excess of Carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapon , it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland , in its lens core , normal Carbon @-@ 14 amounts were produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ o &apos;clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ meter long Greenland was an age of 335 years , while the record H@@ ai is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ female could get offspring only when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to issue an old age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme lives mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the old record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , caught up at the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on peak , was captured on Alaska in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organis@@ m of living animals lives on spar@@ flame .
so they mature later - and al@@ tern slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are often particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with an elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore dangerous and should concentrate on the way as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very large beast should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
with themes around the building , the municipal situation in the most recent session has been discussed .
with relief , the panel took the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , &quot; finally the marketing of re@@ juven@@ ated residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the basic , par@@ abolic and closing statements and the mot@@ ions have been clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on reference , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; road route &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction period 1 ) are not interested in interested parties .
the municipality is convinced that the weak@@ nesses in the rural and peaceful residence of Schön@@ au young families and upgra@@ de@@ able senior citizens alike .
as it was commanded , building consent will be advised from immediately in the town hall , on the awarding of the plots is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to order in@@ quiries for the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial firms , together with the creation of job creation , the council decided to change the area newly created area in the spring of this year only in the spring of this year .
thus in the area Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n the industrial area is expanded by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main was therefore the best opportunities to move from London to Dublin , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets of Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money stores continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU Pass the admission in the UK is up to date .
this has just major US banks .
several banks have already announced to leave jobs .
the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; Association expects a 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
in Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the ECB &apos;s headquarters in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance fund E@@ IO@@ PA and the CR@@ R@@ B European insurance fund .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , however , is less significant for the financial sector , less significant than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close to the bank@@ note is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg stays a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure is worse .
Frankfurt am much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
the city further points the city with light available business real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer the city is seated in place seven , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris to 3@@ 7th place .
even if life quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; repe@@ ating the I@@ W .
but London will continue to remain the most important financial center in Europe in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it vote .
this also applies to the forces : in London , according to numbers of the Landesbank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck

Clin@@ t deser@@ ve 10.6 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % state taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s US dollar donated USD 1 million for beneficial purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster , for their book concerning its office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns of the last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; was Clinton &apos;s Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ing in relation to its existing promises to publish its tax returns .
it is common to publish their tax return data for US presidential candidate , although it is not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as a reason for ref@@ using a control test to tax authorities .
&quot; you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ian Sam@@ s signed election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Consult@@ ant said to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critic , among others also the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already believed that his ref@@ usal issues relating to property , his donations for charity and various other connections , notably with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the topic and posted a video on the Internet in Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish its tax return .
on Thursday she said the subject also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or less tax for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ers who could still be the case .
Federal Government has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets that would make sure people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton at the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax returns .

Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign has released tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , who now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , will have an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .

Jewish Director of the Berlin Hotel , because Israel &apos;s pre@@ fix was removed &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; off @-@ off - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ sealed a media group after having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel was not listed in Berlin in Berlin because it had demanded Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the &quot; Sho@@ a documentary &quot; Sho@@ a left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by putting an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country code list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be found directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , elim@@ in@@ ates that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to vote for Israel via its own call center .
after a declaration the director turned to the hotel concept .
the answer he received there , &quot; caught him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that behind it was , in the director , the director dissolved more W@@ ut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre@@ fix was deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company has been cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Southern German newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has applied in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a rather big response in the Internet , where the people sc@@ andal the whole sc@@ andal .
some sub@@ ordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that there had been an alleged involvement of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post that pointed out that the hotel is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all the alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; innocent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not take into the express list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the abol@@ ition of sanctions , according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran at the same year rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been cancelled , the interest in pages of Russian companies grew strongly on shops in the country , the ambassador divided up .
Russian companies accept connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further trading is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 decreased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and totalled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade margin was reached by deliveries of machines , country vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan runs for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian abroad consisted of some 35,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel agency , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record number of Irish tourists in Russia will be broken off the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , just relatively few Russians visits Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold Medal for cycling sport
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in the bicycle team @-@ spr@@ ite in the Vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio for fame , when the UK team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow had taken a role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made a legend . he made the legend , when he was stor@@ med home to home a victory of the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ medals .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the railway World Championships in London in spite of the fall of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retirement creates a gap that tried K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , that is now un@@ folding .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a olymp@@ ic record , but in the second round the New Zealand won in the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , the team came back slightly , but Kenn@@ y did the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a large part of the transformation , with the Hin@@ des in a higher gear to slow it , and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to enable the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as a BBC expert from and , Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des fell on the podium again .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make myself a name .
we conquered a Olympic record in the En@@ dr@@ unde , and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was hin@@ ts that he fell down on the track after a weak start .
he moved this statement later , and there was no obj@@ ection of the UK ri@@ vals .
with such a victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad in so many world titles so bad that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom .
with the Form of Kenn@@ ys it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated the Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently most holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese from Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the Sprint , which starts today and will start over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
one can win it with his colleagues .
it feels so lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two gold medals , he should be defeated to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts competition of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ y W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived at their destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , who won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first round of round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the race , with the W@@ ig@@ gins .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with evidence before the qualification , when the officials called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , continuing tomorrow and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ est in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team reli@@ es on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals .
an extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London were down the expectations for Rio .
in the background , Dr@@ amas was in the background , as the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ cases as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first night of the competition in Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite afterwards , then the legendary Call of GB@@ S , who has reached the perfect moment to reach its zen@@ ith again .
future of the melting of Portland due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ t@@ ze of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy agreement and thus re@@ charge all the supply agreements as the supplier of energy companies took .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to be commissioned .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is made in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 work stations -@@ direct and indirect - may be at risk at a closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ate , since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ an .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point of Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked up a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last@@ ly due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ on with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ino Valley , distributed that three more owners will be dis@@ closed .
the facility is in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , among which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting ei , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
AG@@ L also said that the tre@@ aties of &quot; securing transactions &quot; are to be entered into effect as of November 2016 .
the tre@@ aties have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from therefore , AG@@ L is assuming that the contracts for the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong termin@@ ations in wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with that it had already written the value of contracts at the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; skill Alco@@ as ... &quot; to ensure the melt or power supply to the melt , &quot; not imp@@ aired .
the US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force by November this year , even if it is yet a statement , why the contract is returned from the contract .
analysts anticip@@ ate due to the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible locking of the Portland melting ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland generates around 900 megawatts and tom@@ ago to use roughly 900 megawatts .
should both systems disappear from the market , would mean a considerable decrease of demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of V@@ ogue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the US V@@ ogue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn ) as well as the cover of their sister and ends with a classic mark : you have all planned an surprises .
this represents the cl@@ ut@@ ee@@ zed hand@@ ing almost every birthday of a children ( Se@@ ac@@ rest ) brought the sentence that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a animation on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kr@@ is had to leave their other girl somehow to this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim is her what the V@@ ogue cover is defeated , ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ issue is for V@@ ogue the most often sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that is rather res@@ embles a photo magazine as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing 615 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive that over the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ ap@@ le@@ ased out of the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , &quot; the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ at@@ ist Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or youth from today who know how to rot@@ ates a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all on J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers became a bit ten@@ se at the fashion world .
in June crit@@ ici@@ zing Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and named them &quot; the mist@@ ak@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings went up high when the message came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ er on the V@@ ogue cover .
but it seems to have been lying on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ issue of V@@ ogue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertisement for your base of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you images of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it sells from her made images by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in their leisure it is visible in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers annually make 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the support for the country &apos;s aid supplies are reported annually by the municipal service centers , while the industry accounts for the impact of further aver@@ ages on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queens@@ land already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violent actions and those who have no means for un@@ parall@@ eled del@@ og@@ ations and similar - in their request for free legal advice and law stood .
legal services of the community , which are already used for exc@@ essi@@ vely , are ready for further cuts .
as of June the next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal aid .
the Director of the Mu@@ es@@ land of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Association revealed that thousands of people had already rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse due to the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Queens@@ land Municipal Centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from most important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who left violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pressing debts , families who have been dismissed by divi@@ den@@ cies , workers who have un@@ affected problems - all those people have problems right kind and this collection shows that they cannot get the help you need .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government will sh@@ orten the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , causing thousands of state @-@ needy people from Queens@@ land to be forced to justi@@ fy their legal problems without any help .
we call for the Federal Minister of Defence and Justice of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to keep these middle distances immediately , so people need help who need them in legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal aid to national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community service centers and their customer @-@ communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important job .

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l of the European Parliament elections : SPD and the CDU lose
in the upcoming elections to the Federal State of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and the CDU governing party .
this resulted in the representative surveys of the research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Picture &quot; -@@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could continue to reg@@ ain , this is not possible after re@@ frac@@ tions in Berlin .
the SPD , however , would be the strongest party in both federal states and would have good chances to make the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD r@@ ushed out by 3@@ 5.6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party saw only slightly ahead of the CDU which could come back to 23 per cent .
third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left hand would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be present at 19 percent for the first time .
despite the slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Green Party returns to the focal point of the country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
according to the Berlin Congress of Dep@@ uties , the SPD gained only 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they ran again behind the Green party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the dep@@ uties of the dep@@ uties .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could trust in a return , the pirates would definitely miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ mail and Internet in time of time : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator has arrived on the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory amounted to eight Meg@@ abytes , which would be sufficient for roughly two types of sel@@ dom with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers of the devices can still be purchased on the Internet , but they originate from the Stone Age of the Internet era .
20 years ago , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a couple of months before at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in West @-@ bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to receive a lot : SMS and email messages could be sent and received , also by fax it was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML brow@@ sers if tor@@ so slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be stopped like a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black and white display found .
rather proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 , that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
ever since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today saw vend@@ ors , which came every much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere being online today , this is for many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million units .
the worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app @-@ providers and the telecommunications family come .
all around the smartphone in the meantime , around the smartphone has grown .
the decisive breakthrough towards the mass market occurred at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple &apos;s chief announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World as the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a Internet communications , easy to use by touch screen .
Apple began the Apple &apos;s victory , still today the iPhone is the prime example of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now we have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility for 20 years after his invention .
today , everybody has been on the phone today for 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to define the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens Executive Board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessi@@ bility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must extend the Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction in Heath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be able to achieve new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , there are already 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end .
as soon as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will take us on the world stage .
the bi@@ kers had wrong in 2012 and they are wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but Heath@@ row answered every question .
as the London Olympic Games is Heath@@ row for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in we@@ aving growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to both the airport and the whole UK .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ ers of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running ste@@ er , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the enlargement of Heath@@ row is also one .
it is time we expand this Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row and thereby creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England .

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; regarding display block
according to one of the software manufacturing vend@@ ors , we get to circum@@ vent ad block tests , a &quot; cad@@ ence and m@@ ash play . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there would be block@@ ade on his desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which it ha@@ sted that users could update their filter in the program to block advertis@@ ements in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook share that his desktop side would change the coding regarding his advertis@@ ements , to make it advert@@ ise the detection over which part of the page is advertising to detect difficult .
but Ad@@ ad announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ ad Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the lab@@ eled open source community and the det@@ ach@@ ers already exists since the invention of display lock@@ ers in the track , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company established for social media in the fight is a strong Indian for the industry , as a wor@@ r@@ ying ad c@@ ures for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe in the past year , there are some 200 million min@@ ut@@ op@@ iers in the world ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users that connect on Facebook about their mobile devices , making hand@@ y@@ wer@@ age 84 percent of advertising items .
the company has changed it on display block to desktop PCs as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , it divided a speaker .
advertising on your desktop PCs makes a suff@@ iciently large proportion of income from which Facebook appears to be worthwhile as a re@@ mun@@ eration .
on Tuesday , Facebook share that it would be &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to make people more control over it .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that No@@ block new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they might block content on the page that are not advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this is no positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advert@@ iser are a bl@@ unt means , why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people .
woman imp@@ lies suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls witness , after a woman being killed in the early morning hours on Thursday with an assumed self @-@ murder of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 motorway close to Morges in the canton of V@@ aud .
a woman made in Dun@@ kl@@ en , in an act of desp@@ air , on the street and were hit by several cars , the police stopped in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 was that of several vehicles , including a truck , was trying to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not yet identified , the police , who , as well as every witnesses of the incident , have already been identified .
it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be held responsible for responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the Dun@@ kl@@ en on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers do not need to go out that a pedestrian prec@@ inct in the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted , having killed a man and killed a man who had a night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become conscious of the road .
the court stated that the polic@@ ew@@ oman was given to a emergency call -- on a justified fashion , and that the presence of a man on the street had a &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to proj@@ ections , Venus was likely to be hab@@ itable for the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble from climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once might have noticed similar conditions .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow motion of Venus could be declared through its dense atmosphere .
but the most recent simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ row@@ ed atmosphere , and slowly caught up slowly .
the model illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas as de earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ Modell@@ simulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long@@ standing revolution of Venus declared its day@@ time on the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io declared in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , that creates a thick layer of clouds , which is like a rain umbrella , to reduce the surface of a large solar heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that res@@ embles the evolution that were supposed to be seen from planning research .
even though it was presumably hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ates and their water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when their Hydro@@ gen was left off only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy stepped down on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a decision to do the decision on the decision of the team .
alternatively , General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and notice that the club will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past three years I had my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and un@@ certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy scored in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I have thought much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this requires and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a specific decision in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Z@@ acc@@ ic , the Roy was fired on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked with him for his team &apos;s contributions .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed last year in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second game @-@ card spot in the Western Conference round five points .
in the Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ r and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ Oil workers res@@ ume discussions again , put out strike
the working vap@@ ors regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ Oil workers are exposed , while all the parties must set the table for a new conversation round to the table , said negoti@@ ator leaders .
strikes against the field of oil field service Wood Group have been run spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and the Trade Unions can confirm that we have unified ourselves to re @-@ start the process process of the current battle , &quot; it says in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re @-@ start the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company is followed by a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts from the company needed the necessary space to come across the market down@@ turn .
shell announced for his part of thousands of people , and plans to spend up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ az@@ us@@ ability integration with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
energy companies are located on the basis of lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that was forced to leave the European Union by decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the largest employment disp@@ utes ar@@ ising since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the constellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with Kepler &apos;s Kepler leader teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the full catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers why stars in star design are rotating at different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are standing with the planning formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope we learn through the compar@@ isons of our findings , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is 445 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this star design , which were created around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you are now on the fastest .
these m@@ aturing stars abo@@ unds great amounts of ast@@ er@@ ous winds .
since the winds of the stars are travelling , they have a slow impact on the stars .
when a star is broken , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable constellation -- such as sun h@@ edges --
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more than massive stars are turning as less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars of slow pi@@ rou@@ ds faster than smaller .
in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that long rot@@ ors tend to be massive , more comfortable , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare primary qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much ahead of us how we want to learn more , like how , when and why stars are slow@@ ing down their rot@@ ational rates and to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ations of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star occurs from
the tears run on Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base .
after his emotional back@@ drop , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will take on August 12th against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to the &quot; explained the 14 @-@ times all @-@ Star game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
in 2009 Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has issued a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the double room on 31 December 2017 , he will continue to serve as a consultant and a youth coach - at full salary .
when player paid Rodri@@ guez long time with power .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Nav@@ al ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es several mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of Fame of Fame , H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays have only two further bas@@ eball players in the main statistics similar to the market .
nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not yet to be included in the glory hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - that was on the field , it is cont@@ ested at the appearance outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star appeared at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken care of ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , it was closed due to a performance in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ icious , for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute the sperm was still reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done for me for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez then swe@@ pt at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell days are not silent .
while there are many bas@@ eball le@@ gen@@ ds in their final games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ard@@ i .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first ro@@ op@@ ing@@ cases
knowing : Adrian Dest@@ inski from Poland in Rio will not start due to a positive d@@ oping sample due to a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ probe .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be sur@@ passed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a ignor@@ ant athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dates of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro have become known .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the critical Athle@@ tics competitions , this news for the time .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic um hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d has been demonstrated on the last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ ask@@ an agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ zen .
the International Sport@@ Court CA@@ S confirmed the appointment of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 year old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , but only 0.09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the discussion of over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are working together with the International Sport@@ al@@ Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the extraction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news fell above the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old himself went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four @-@ fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was innocent , &quot; the only statement could be supplements , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics athl@@ ete .
according to the report , it is said to act with the forbidden substance for blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ itis EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B Trial should have already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow told you immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why sport@@ s@@ men do not drag the right battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We may stand under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ed ground may not be able to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the &quot; Adrian Dest@@ inski &quot; event was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested positive in the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both cont@@ ests , both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further heavy blow for the Rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team until an exception to the start of systematic D@@ op@@ ings , also the British nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming pool , the previous clubs in China had also sung a violent disp@@ utes between the athletes .
the Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t helped the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium for over 200 m , I will pass over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also in the heart of a meditation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping @-@ Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; said this .
sun was positi@@ vely tested for the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock .
data kl@@ au : such per@@ fi@@ de re@@ pressing h@@ ack@@ ers their sol@@ eg@@ eld
programm@@ ers of replacement @-@ malware is currently targeted for companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ s@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany over 40 percent of surveyed companies have at least once , partly several victims of a attack with ex@@ pressing software .
in Germany , just under 20 percent of companies already aim to establish a Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ Er@@ aser .
40 percent of the victims were ready to be ready to use the perpet@@ rators in order to re @-@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their legal software according to the observations by Mal@@ don@@ ytes to attacks in companies in the company network .
if they are successful there , the potential for pressing sol@@ eg@@ eld is considerably higher than with private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe fast evolution of damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mal@@ c@@ ytes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the pressing software for itself .
it was only the goal of private use , but the change to company attacks carried out quickly during the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it is looking for specific files such as Word@@ - , cel@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files en@@ codes the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
afterwards , the software presents the requirements of the legal notice .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ t Bit@@ coin - exc@@ essive .
however , where private use is the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off , if a ran@@ som@@ ce proposes .
22 percent of the affected German companies registered sales loss due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to undergo the business activities completely , in case of one case humans were in life @-@ danger .
in Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of ambul@@ ances .
&quot; we say always the victims : do not pay , you &apos;re promoting the problem , &quot; says Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
it is difficult for managers to re@@ ject the claim of perpet@@ rators in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good Rep@@ utation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security researchers examined the user surface and contact with the presses and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or un@@ turn@@ key for free example files .
and they will be redeemed according to payments of a few hundred Euro , companies need to pay hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and closed dust removal
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty crow@@ ded , but the HR @-@ V that was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz was indeed extremely flexible in everyday life .
despite the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear of the rear , it works closely closely .
the materials of the inner space are well processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the reservoir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 453 l at high set and 10@@ 26 l at re@@ ject back re@@ ject , but there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back can be folded as kin@@ dle @-@ chair and thus provide storage space that is high up to the ceilings 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot compartment can be loaded well , but the load height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to do his job a bit more quiet .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is still available : a 1.5 @-@ liter petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is should be slightly direct .
the equipment can be seen in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wishes .
the City emergency braking assistant is one of the safety systems ( works up to 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the trace assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision is sometimes emp@@ tied because he rated many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ ann@@ ess objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote driver works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller react to traffic signs and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t when needed .
but the full connectivity is available only for top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App Integration and More .
two USB and one HDMI socket are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .

better traffic flow on the motorway acc@@ ord
a picture st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the right has to be renewed .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand on the road traffic on the surrounding road every night in St@@ au if they take over the highway ( Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction extends on the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße the right hand gauge track about 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , thereby improving the total value at the much @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the District Apostle Meeting Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the driver mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler road .
from here the traffic is only tra@@ cked on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in front of a good three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no longer the required power capacity to absorb the heavy duty of the two @-@ purpose .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and so it is forbidden to pass through it , the competent nation can not say .
however , with years to calculate : for the bridge has an official rest of time until 20@@ 34 .
the national level has been deliber@@ ately chosen for extending the traffic weak@@ est time in the school holidays , because it was to be counted with disabilities .
the traffic will be gone on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you can endure for ever , at night , one is for hours , so far in the wake of the wake up there is no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and over ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently recovered .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many reasons based , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ert , member of the German Society for Sle@@ eves and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
as a result , the In@@ som@@ nia is under@@ going , so the In@@ som@@ nia is unprecedented .
just that breaks out many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German house medical association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or neg@@ atively conditional factors , but also medic@@ ations are stuck .
it is not sel@@ dom , the disorder of a different disease is rare .
&quot; very early wake up is often often with depression , &quot; says White .
and it can be that various factors require each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , akes all two to three hours , and starts bl@@ am@@ ily at all everyday problems and points to sal@@ ts , there is also an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when to sleep with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
if you don &apos;t sleep well over a month with a month in at least three nights per week and on the day they should go to the doctor to take a We@@ ak .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : it is ab@@ beaten , tired , un@@ broken , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has sw@@ ings fluctu@@ ations or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to relie@@ ve the sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , among other things conduct changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic sleeping tablets only in the exceptional case and not at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of inter@@ disciplinary dormit@@ ory health care centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore it should be possible to contact sleeping any problems at the medical specialist .
who can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was to sleep in sleep , and what happens ?
for investigation in a sleep laboratory medical advice for example , for example , in case of s@@ nor@@ ing with respiratory system , at number of diseases or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping trou@@ gh , fixes .
you do not need to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not make a lunch . &quot; says Fi@@ ga@@ ze .
after joining the bed , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes by the body one can carry a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ el@@ ler on the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can the problems get in the handle ?
there are rather many screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
it counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not watching television to sleep , alcohol and night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and not favor@@ ably .
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself as a dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
he took the first gold medal in Doha in December 2014 and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has protected his ex @-@ team mate via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a jungle king over 150.000 € should nobody find any missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the feed system in the swimming sport is bad , while D@@ oping control is very good .
with this , we can not compete with countries which are very much promote and do not see it in the subject of D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls are set to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , that D@@ ei@@ bler would have already reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly what you should also do with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who can not take a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent checks of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the selection of Hamburg , who now runs an iron di@@ ele . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage arrested
professional slide at the Düsseldorf Airport
a civil engineer of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the o@@ susp@@ ects had already committed several T@@ ash@@ - and Bag@@ gage ste@@ els as a ban@@ de .
at 21.@@ 30 a.m. , civil servants was re @-@ known at the Düsseldorf Airport , which was known as polic@@ emen from the past years of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes committed in the middle of July this year and were especially profession@@ ally working and particularly profession@@ ally .
the specialists of the Criminal Code 34 can follow the di@@ ets that were in@@ tr@@ insi@@ sted for off@@ ences from offen@@ ders to Germany , four deeds .
they took over 15,000 euros in total .
Alt@@ build@@ ed , a few Lin@@ den@@ baths , in between still another head@@ quar@@ p@@ av@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works on the first glance at the first glance , but the police counts it among the &quot; hazardous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one arrives on play@@ grounds , a refreshing nur@@ ser@@ y and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which will also be demolished soon , it will be built until 2017 : a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here .
article about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ ant district , &quot; as the competent property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , will be preferred by burning cars during the last weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of hire , however , have occupied rooms and are used for events .
particularly the Berlin interior of the Berlin interior had several occasions for a hard approach to the police , the area as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous authority .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rolling parts of the street , closed parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house @-@ owner houses the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers moved under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
during this summer afternoon the road appears peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the mayor in front of the houses in the sun , others maintain pre@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects , there are an elementary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left Viol@@ ence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in pine trees since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are living here three children , are mainly by the police presence .
with the residents of the hood projects they share the concern of increasing revenues and cent@@ ered .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a pine , who wish to termin@@ ate the majority of the police from the v@@ and@@ ing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin &apos;s inner ens@@ ator and the police , make up their neighbours , obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional working class that is , even today , compared to the rest of the city a lower average number of income and high risk of poverty .
also house sel@@ ections and the resulting living projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in former GDR , among them almost the entire mainstre@@ am road near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared by a real road battle in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ id and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and elec@@ tu@@ ers from all over the world : with them , residents of the GDR times and former house occupied their jaw .
this is also noticeable during the rent , which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ id are attacked as symbols for these development : one recogni@@ zes them from the discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to color wra@@ ps .
no other street was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this that not all neigh@@ bors who have been considered to be a problem , could not be imp@@ ly affected by the crime : offen@@ ders as human rights are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make non@@ damage , and ten@@ ds to meet the newly built new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , there may be no speech of un@@ certainty .
what violence is concerned , it is essential : people in the 94 are their neighbours , they don &apos;t have this .
even the famous burning cars , there are no longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal off@@ point , on the contrary : &quot; here one can help one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er Street , and remained .
therefore it was also so important to get back the residents of their road : from the police , the politics and the media , which suddenly stressed the De@@ ut@@ ri@@ oh@@ eit across the district in July .
however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to carry them away : by healthy new buildings in former building g@@ aps , which push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are finally con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many , - here are people living not so well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not be gu@@ ilt . &quot;
but what should we do if a man never listen to someone ?
there is a fru@@ str@@ ations on all sides , including the police and the residents .
for people who like to engage with st@@ icky bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
whoever moves , should be aware of this - just like a man who goes into a p@@ ubs , there are po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise there .
all only having given names were asked , not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee camp
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer .
in addition , it is a social worker .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the Social Ped@@ agog@@ in supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it can be seen as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , labor costs refugees , authorities , authorities and those else .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the hon@@ ors are more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , the pure wool mil@@ dew that has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cking as much rather than looking for the multitude of task @-@ targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the job .
we searched for a management team with a talent for languages and people combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the area of social work , just a pure wool mil@@ dew .
but administrative work is not its central area , says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it &apos;s about organisation , work with the people on site and behind the scenes as well as network drives .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in operation for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point on the basis of three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and authority was supported .
there are large and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting fle@@ ets that have been recognised for some time .
for the connection , the municipalities are competent .
you need to accommodate refugees in your own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodation need to bear the commun@@ es itself .
the responsibility is to changes from the council with local community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search for some time is very difficult .
de facto administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work until now , unless you are invited to private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the official apartments must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the basin .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine client and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le one .
in addition to a fixed stay , there are plac@@ ements , training places , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and out@@ aging activities for refugees and migrants who have to be established or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Custom@@ ers .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ated and very ti@@ dy , like An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the industry leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
the people have to develop an inv@@ ari@@ ous feeling .
so special offers like sport , contacts with domestic and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so please ski@@ p here to management and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you have to explain the refugees that it takes , and they can take the time meaning@@ fully , for example with language courses .
whoever will stop using the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , wouldn &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable , he will never have to integrate .
the clear majority may be motiv@@ ated .
problem exists , but also says the customer hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; People who are not doing anything . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
