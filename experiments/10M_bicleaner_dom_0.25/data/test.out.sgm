<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - these are both Clinton and rubump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are based on the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and warns before, like the state of the economy - with tax and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton would impress the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, it might be quite different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive regression massively, and he makes himself a wide tax reform with lower tax rates strongly - for private experts and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has set certain tasks to open, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore the tax would be increased for the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost right away.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application in announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investments programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are turned down by the state ritical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">On trump, the internal discussions could be found.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant differences in energy and climate policies are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and driving the coal promotion in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand and demands renewable energies with its investment programme, and calls: "a country will produce the superpower of the clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only for the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transponder fish trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">But at the same time, both the United States do not want to isolate the international trade, but just to protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are then to be paid better then, for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does not want to do in this question is not clear: once again he says: the minimum wage must wait, then he says he would not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the next months should be more likely to develop the tax policy of both bearings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side stands Trump, who wants to lightens the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him, so the budget deficit would be even larger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least of the rich who want to pay more taxes, and their critics say, more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is not a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with big eyes in the room.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is Area Manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social support services in Bavaria, and among others, with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry shinged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all occupied women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say," "" "Every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because of them or death, or because their families send them to Europe as well as their families."</seg>
<seg id="24">There are other reasons for the escape: "many steal away secretly, because they could not see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honour, slavery, or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "that tugs are required for a bottle of water a sexual action is no rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre tells you.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, women would often be considered as minas and worsened in refugee accounts.</seg>
<seg id="32">That leads to approximately 90 per cent of the women who live in the North in Munich, traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women have been so accustomed to say nothing to say.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they do not trust, open to talk about the people, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not want to help, more accommodations only need for them, requested Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they were using a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, reply some with No.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken there are not something in shelters of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Schwaben, alone, women are not separately accommodated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mittelfranken there are several floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the Committee" "" "Rights of women and gender equality" "" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published by the Committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women can be separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated together, it may cause persistent - violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Above all the shower rooms should be separated and accessible for women easily, standing in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women may feel of this protective need, you can read on the quay, which there is on the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested his total advice from the beginning of September more labor measures.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it would have been ministers to agree to the worries regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistant doctors and medical assistants voted on the rejection of a contract which was agreed with the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of foreign failure"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in the reception, I can't forbid that Ankara wants to take this reconciliation at most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the rash, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin was an irpallied smile, and it shined little warmth, even for his receding conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said repeatedly by his "love" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard that would never happen worse than that.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate his enthusiasm for the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable chats showed that Russian state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first of what he mentioned in his introduction: the firing of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from reaction to the time was wutentated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared out and accused Ankara to have fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ship was even bigger, as it was celebrated by a mean friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrough rebuilding is difficult to build if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media led a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed, the Turks would bear all the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations of senior officials announced that Erdogans had benefited its own family of illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He contested this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meetings took place only because Putin received the President of the President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily used for all friends who can get, after spending the last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russia's sanctions were hard - in particular, the ban of charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late summer tower of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the sovereign debt of low-fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is raged on the west, since there was a response to the tempting power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, the persisting penny of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping on it is to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian State leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he urged by the attempted coup d "état for the elected government organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-mentioned for Moscow, a self-intelligibility, which has to change a deeper fear of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glassy palace resulted in Russia and Turkey, one as it described to me an analyst, "Alliance of outside fail": two countries that hailing from the west and poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support other parties.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be characteristic that after almost three hours of first discussions on the press conference, they said that they would not have striped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey avoided this to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member of the Russian combat jet - it certainly is better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">Since then the bank has been distressed because it had been almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, brand RBS "brand have used to protect other consumer financial stamps.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of Pounds in Sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby up to the Wimbledon winner of Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland is only available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralized headquarter and the stock markets are to be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for the private customer, which will receive more significance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEWAN was interviewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB will be to our investor brand, as well as to the brand, under which our employees will be busy, since we are now more to become a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">RBS has become a global brand for the world to become a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not a global goals, but pursue local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be in their own parishes for something completely different and our staff will work under these trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already told that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptions of various brands in his Sport-Sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Board of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical before three years, when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can resume this brands again, therefore I think that the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="16">It has style and is strong, but it is its tactic intellect that differs him from the other in weight control room.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin, Putin said that Putin have ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidiary administration without specifying for reasons. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been deputy deputy chairman since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin (in Russian), he later told the head of the head of the head office (Russian) head office.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state to bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that IVANOV had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei IVANOV was a long time one of the most engaging Vladimir Putin's and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV in television, both men had said that the Chief of Staff to be back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the reason for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially in the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power here?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once had ended as a potential president, would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - overthrew big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are cited on the site of the Kremlin, IVANOV said "it's true that I had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, I could almost say this very complicated item - you could almost say to confidential over four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it happened, I've been chairman of the Russian presidiary administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin was a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Bundessional Service (FSB), which appointed KGB, IVANOV was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called IVANOV as one of five people who he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that IVANOV could be President of Russia by Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister, before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "Handbook concept" to the next meeting.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but 20 percent of the apartments can be used as a social-level." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's amazing to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child to play no longer go outside, but rather, prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens, was planted in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about to pick people up from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hence, it's great to see that technology and activities are not close to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm going to be inspired by the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters, first created for video games in the 1990s (later made a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon will go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS as soon as they were found, "photographs" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "per day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardilemma, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, divided the Washington Post with that within two days after the market launch of the game, the number of people followed up every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for the performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health, people want to bring in "30 minutes" to come from the sofa "and" every day actively to be able to fall, because many public messages are boring for health and are people who look like to look.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who are regularly drives sport reduces his chances to treat cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps by weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it takes people to do something outdoors, that fun do them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars are covered by health - motion, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mürric games that always must complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What does it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier we could follow before our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose his appeal and use the time using the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, thanks to Pokemons, there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activates will unite in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Cheymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to walk with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you come from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn around your thieves.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you arrive from behind, then you should turn as first, so that you can see your attackers and proceed out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the gun to face your face between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with the knee into the lath and turn, while the attackers are together before pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backward, while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers who approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, grab the weapon and turn them, so the attackers cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Leave the weight at the same time and beat the attackers on the chest, then turn the gun from its handle, before moving forward and set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi prepares.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travelling Ian Wright shabt for a guide of his tongue to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undergone his immune system and wordeflex - by taking some of the most polluted and most difficult places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel agency Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped its wake up on a Euro-Schein, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a purge button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to proof the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to the check of each object, he used a Luminometer to show us and show us what he is going to inlet.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought that allows the purge of a train toilet, who has already been used by thousands of others, may become totally shock, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to physicians and medical professionals over the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he ablished, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowel by joining the world and ate independent things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to jawns of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all things in my mouth, Earth, worms and slucater."</seg>
<seg id="12">In his film, he was just right in his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only one refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its balance sheet showed a luminance of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminance of the Luminometres is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that refused to refresh themselves after their Luminometres over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this comes to the worst, what I have a toilet in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will check here nothing because it is inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with valio gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the foal of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer a little something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and explain the advantages of Probiotics as well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led the mad Brainstormings that they ended, that we asked "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just over the products we wanted to provide them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they are associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information about an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, said: "let me lose my respect for Ian, if he had been waiting for Ian, which I had given to him, as demonstrated by the Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things, where it was easier to bring Ian, they anzains and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have recorded some of these dirty deals on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted in 2015, 84 percent of those questioned from lactic acid bacteria have associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain the attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing out of summer campaign with - and vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the focal Parliament voted already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">So far as to date, it is not so far: summer holidays, heat and landrush combat - that is enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals which are to be convinced by the electors are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationists who are on the land are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are no locals, so you cannot choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays, helpers, the posters hang up, flyers and flashing the flyers in the end of the vote, only hard labour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to be able to pass over the people in the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern more than expected.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998, is the strongest party since 1998, is clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strong Neuling Afreccuts, and what remains at the end of Koalitionist.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive electoral struggle, one can see from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributed roses and plauds a little with people, as it already did his legendary Harald Ringstorff's predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise socks got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the bloom of the Afrect.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, you" We "" "" have accelerated the rise of the populists, which will probably cost him now the beautiful office. "" "</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top-edge data, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has experienced how it is when you meet the wrong time at the right place election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">Angela Merkel has invited Angela Merkel for major documents, the Merkel Bundestag is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states" "" "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany, to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast CDU renounces the usual election events on market conditions and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, as a Kokert, plays only an "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Even the Union also noted that you have the base the base that it must be very rigorous to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the sides of the country hardly exists.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU electoral fought against his fellowites is also self-researched: "you have to go there where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game, Sellering has now called for a particularly dedicated campaign of campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only just ahead of the Afonso (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">The SPD was clearly won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22) before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, a small party with seven percent in the polls, would like to make the leap into the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They do not make a modern virtue out of the holiday troubles and impose their election campaign off on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" campaign, "says the Chair Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green electoral rider go to trecensorship to local stimulators amongst the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidacin, curt straight with a houseboat by the mecklenburgische lakes, and it also finds it nice.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly screwed in the name of the terror attack on laws.</seg>
<seg id="2">Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a Dulce status have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciler.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are politically acceptable, "says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of its new security package.</seg>

<seg id="8">Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also, I am holding myself.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the Minister of the Interior, however, it was very close to him and on a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière has left a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, before leaving his conclusions for safety in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already known, promulgated, announced that a new security authority to worry about the crack's neck is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU specifications on flight passenger data and ceasefire.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security regulatory authorities is not surprisingly well.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second start for suggestions that have not been doing so far with the SPD: he wants to crate sympathy for terrorists and Jihadists with double citizenship to the German Pass.</seg>
<seg id="17">"these difficult points will be difficult for the SPD," the CDU. "</seg>

<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even unbalanced and makes questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the inequality treatment of Gedulled for example - the question arises: what does it actually do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not so in mind that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were killed.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people in view of the high refugee numbers are concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things, who employed people, let not let themselves clamps in campaign events even in electoral events.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the devices in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, it's eligible to fight.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD approaches the subject of internal safety increasingly in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days there went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a gardeness dispute over the configuration of the Federal Police, then over a safety-critical ideas collection of some Unions inside the departments also need a Burka ban and a return of double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling for silently tones here.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double pass, he doesn't receive anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We satisfy the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not meaningfully, be sensible.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a Burka ban he have constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is constitutionally unconstitutional, and whether it actually is "reasonable" is for the coalition partner, it has to show itself still.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot of things that could cause dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD also tries to profiling itself with the subject of internal safety.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually purchases sound boards?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before using the commentary part, in order to overcome it under the pseudonym Non-antitational age of men with rough insults, this statement leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most varied reformation of records are not due to a boom in millennials which would like to welcome the curiosity of physical objects, but on Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a board are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is no hormones by Hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older record players retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this Blog is an news report on TV would follow me while I carry out my camera in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit before I stand to stop my hands and something like: "so let's throw us a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart socks the heart of SoHos in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the building where independent sellers have been based - there is a handful of fantastic record transactions.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera when I was able to switch the camera for the next part in which I am standing in immediate proximity to different men in such stores, try to assess your age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I turn from Sister Ray (data number: eight male aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men aged middle age, one woman probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to complete the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I'm thinking," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by myself), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy them when she had been selling and again items that he sold, when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late '60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who want to buy records are rather petalled and like to spend alone time, and add: "I smoke not and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that meets it meets the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhy, people who have heard about the comeback and decided to buy their old boards again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the discussions that I have led, people are usually buried around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy again their disks. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to a plate on a certain type of age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds into a business like Phonica, to realize that disk shops offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers cut off the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel disbanded from the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of objects, happy youth deposits.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possessions of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soldered a staff of a flat stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a board last month is not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntables that they never use while 7% of those who buy a plate does not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I have a stack of Bossa Nova computations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone first came here and said," "" "I don't have a record player but I would like to buy a Radiohead record board, so I'd like to make it into the shelf." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-loads, less music classy.</seg>

<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a dearoused sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of disc lovers: urban Outfit.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the licence to guess the Jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young teammants who grouped for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter are superior to buy a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase outside of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - maybe because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to summarize them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the sector, and some customers in the depths of Soos can be sent to more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money, even the one that is most for luxury objects such as boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and disk burdens, who exist in reality, disk shops and in Onlineforen exist unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are thought to work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the stroll through the stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they keep the starring sight of an unsecret, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders of middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais who live in tens of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week argued the authorities in Calais that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary stores within the camp goods, from cigarettes to Energyh, sell, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals that are offered by the state-supported association and other groups, will not provide sufficient food for growing numbers in stock.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also resulted in that the provisional shop and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but spatially found that the concerns of Calais "prefecture are" absolutely downstream. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive Great Britain of the 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a rupted stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated in Rio at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the handling, Side-Stepping, back on the back, line and roasting power to win Gold - their first Olympic Medal every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat of the Silver Medal was slammed due to the non-bad trophy of the silver medal - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could be traced back to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Fiji had smitten with this form a 15-man team in best form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a comfort for UK - but it probably won't that at least one Brite tomorrow gets a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former chief apostle for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here it just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This mud will do so, but progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to be wonderful and caused the GBS attacks of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the Captain Tom Mitchell and co. it would be running in running buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner of the surfencing.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes of playing game Jerry Tuwai, Jerry Tuwai, added another attack from the right corner that he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly made the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A sharp bend of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to get a third goal, but it only got Fiji only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prepped by other weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as Fiji were born to play the 7, while UK still is daisy.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is that way too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half time and ended the fijian gap... for the four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova was running through a brilliants intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favour of the South African consulate, whose fans sang and dance on the trams.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to see the clerical approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the i-dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff warmed, the Fijis hugged and the GB knocked up into the lawn.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more typealeres gold than for these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 tough hieve that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was there as they were the second Olympics in the bier without tax wife in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports, who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39.ter strained bet, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes, which leads over the surface with the elegance of tears, which does not reflects the nature of the Arc de Triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion to content helpers which make the difference and it was no more useful than the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had a bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a worst situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little to the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky enough to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could begin what the interruption of a minimum, if that could be the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infusion of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who was able to talk about something else than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was a centurion at the Royal Artillery Regiment in an attempt in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeats only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked out.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks go to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have a better person to work or wish for a better coaches.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams arrived from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to take it up.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, going out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for one year before it will make decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventurers Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now it wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that I was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">It took about six months in London to realize that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching position, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old singing in an elderly choir.</seg>

<seg id="5">At the same time, she is doing something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors, "says Erhard Hackler from the German retirement League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Together, senior social contacts can sound and maintain.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the older generations, common Singen had a lot of capacity, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is frequently observed that singing or listening songs in older people are awakened many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and especially melodies, even deartery disease worms itself in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to singing, a special achievement is demanded, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on their own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone do not only practise on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition by singing through singing in chorus, hackler believes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>

<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 sines people who hear, when once a tone goes beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, senior citizens have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone gets from the acquaintance in a veteran army, you can simply connect yourself.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who would like to sing together in a Church choir, can turn right to the church or the church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask help with the internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should be united to a choir, avenge Hackler.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is inspiring, but some observers say that it is unsensibly compared to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With his filter tool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders even to Absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week maintained a filter for several users who gave them slotted, false teeth and ripped cheeks, there are some critics a racist cartoon by Asians - "yellowns."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if this repetitive controversy dropped to a larger problem, that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were spread throughout Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and motherboards, one day after Snapchat, that it would have been deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was thought in homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsient that the racisance had experienced, reminded the filters of inviolating clichés.</seg>

<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-protected, but that the yellow light has been drawn into the most valuable extreme.</seg>

<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters a picture produced, it is a lot more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as product managerin and engineering works for medium, works their Snapchat account to delete others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are working there, but not in positions, in which they are safe or feel good to say about it."</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans had won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, the Americans know them: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic and are equally unbeaten in their group with the British in their first place finish against Japan after 2-0 victory.</seg>

<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in their hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and insofter, a fast relay between competition and struts.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which will protect from the wristband to the runner-up to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos, without having Simone Biles, Katie Leuny or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been extensively sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and Well-being-being advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fuse.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow, there are sports types that are not widely recognised: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breasts and may have a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest arguments for my particular favourite, then you let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the rebounder.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping is already an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, it became the last 16 years so spelled that many people I asked, didn't know that it is a Olympic-port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may also be regional Ignore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes for competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping competition, and has had an athlete, who made it up to the final round in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese, and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear to a clownsschool as the for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous lemurs of its never to end up - but also the grazie of the turnaround and diving, which combines two sports types, which unites it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which is as much as "dive board."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner will jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling moves (turning, hatch and saltos) before landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be judged according to the official Olympic programme according to the execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go straight forward in their journeys to gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go back and down, downwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast another example: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented tracing is nobel, admired, even fanless - and it's enough to stir even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself watching these games as a little tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of these, the trampoline offers a breathing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunts, seemingly heavy toos like an astronaut, go down, then downwards, then go back to top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the goal of no firmament in the distance, only the dreams, elegant lift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the Competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and ducks of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is omniated as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably will see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness increase is achieved only through the Anging and the objectors of male athletes, the same - how it foreseen the male US Turner at the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley is expected to Alexandria up new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators to demand political changes in Ethiopia, beat the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that eighty protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a soloist of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government continued the country and expanded more and more.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people attacked the streets and fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was inhalted according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave us that policemen shot down on an unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, over the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the chief of the UN Authority of Human Rights requires an ongoing investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to meet this land and will even become more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi said," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">U.S. military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians together to fight terror against the region, in particular in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new extension to the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are normally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything as a model for democracy - the human rights organisations have continually led the repression through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereas dissidents were effectively transferred to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, or put into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you submit people and do not need any other options except to protest it," "" "Seym Tesco" "" "said," "" "said Seym Tesco, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from soil utilization to the litgey in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now serves 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this hacky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts predicts that separatists, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were able to exploit more or less in recent years, could deploy the turmoil and to come back.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of deterioration after years of age in front of the surface is now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopian people were able to communicate with the social media, since cheap smartphones have increasingly been more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, especially in protests, people can communicate many people still on the internet proxies that conceal where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian stated that they were among themselves protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">The amharas, which are cultivated in Ethiopia predominantly of Christian high countries, are in the politics and economy, while they explored the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat villages.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the Unrest is Death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel guide, was until his death in a non-public disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical Genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly compensated in that early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractors to make opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this fundamentally," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians, new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was talking to such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested by the government according to information forwarded by the government and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following Razicia, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this period of disturbances went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts lobs Ethiopians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new extension technology, as well as for their measurable progress at the poverty control.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously it does not have the intensification of the internal missal of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it accepts a dangerous ethnic pattern.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of protesting in Gondar, an amharic city, of Tigray led shops and the hatred against the tigray is always usual in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests sweets the US and other western allies in a separate position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights on the nearby Somalia, even if they recently announced that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the west aims to support democracy, he doesn't want to join its alliance in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explained his assertion Obama to be "Sarkasmus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy on Friday that relates his campaign by breaking his campaign, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State of Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gives new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans to communicate whether he was able to communicate and understandable with the American public.</seg>

<seg id="6">But in an early morning, Mr. Trump said, he is simply sarcous.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said within a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to destroy the statement somewhat weakening it, reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, wanted to know the Republican Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism fell to Mr. Trump, while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling refractions on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>

<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism, when he meant, the Russians should hacking Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Of course, I thought the sarist."</seg>

<seg id="18">Instead of the tone to sharpened the Presidential elections, Mr. Trump received an even corrosive sound, because its refractive values went further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new poll of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a huge lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tried to apologize for his provocative statements, he accused his critics to understand his testimony or to understand his recommendation.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he strengthened himself in the focus of the attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps lize brought his loyal miter into the uncomfortable situation to be standing, regardless of how provokant may be his testimonies also.</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government ministered by Obama, when Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, it is ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East to control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest eddy is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Less sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually occur only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swim at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get its offspring only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the Greenland on the ground floor of the North Atlantic, it reaches an average of 1,220 meters in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes down, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of loneliness made lifestyle seems to be a sponsor for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal "Science" in any case of Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness" says Alexander Schelemlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock, this life expectancy which means for spedules a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the theory of evolution of evolution already suspected that Greenland was stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice Sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timelage is sufficient for her time, when they equivalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">These sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the pine bones of a young ice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice cream and seek Cadaver, which are tormented from higher water layers to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as catcher from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502-centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens core of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eye lens is already formed before the birth of the sharks, which are contained in it later no longer.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be in the early 1960s, as a nuclear tests, larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere decreased.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a low excess of Carbon-14 from nuclear weapon, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland, in its lens core, normal Carbon-14 amounts were produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-o'clock for a 493-centimeter long Greenland was an age of 335 years, while the record Hai is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-female could get offspring only when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to issue an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusaleme lives mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The old record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, caught up at the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon peak, was captured on Alaska in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of living animals lives on sparflame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and altern slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with an elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore dangerous and should concentrate on the way as possible as many descendants as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large beast should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow had taken a role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made a legend. he made the legend, when he was stormed home to home a victory of the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they took place in March at the railway World Championships in London in spite of the fall of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver's Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement creates a gap that tried Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the villi, that is now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner in the qualification round a olympic record, but in the second round the New Zealand won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, the team came back slightly, but Kenny did the team to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a large part of the transformation, with the Hindes in a higher gear to slow it, and it's Kenny and especially Skinner to enable the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert from and, Skinner, Kenny and Hindes fell on the podium again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>

<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys there was hints that he fell down on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He moved this statement later, and there was no objection of the UK rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindes said:" "" "it feels the whole GB flags on the grandstand as London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation who won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the bicycle rom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the Form of Kennys it is possible in the field of possible that he repeated the Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a apparently most holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The cheese from Hoy equals.</seg>

<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested with evidence before the qualification, when the officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>

<seg id="45">An extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London were down the expectations for Rio.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the repeal of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltze of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the plant operator will terminate the energy agreement and thus recharge all the supply agreements as the supplier of energy companies took.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is made in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the complex of Alcoa in Portland are standing on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 work stations -direct and indirect - may be at risk at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to dominate, since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorian.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point of Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked up a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculations in terms of the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melon with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latino Valley, distributed that three more owners will be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, among which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp will hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting ei," shared the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also said that the treaties of "securing transactions" are to be entered into effect as of November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The treaties have a 12 month period of notice that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from therefore, AGL is assuming that the contracts for the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All the potential impact on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong terminations in wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL shared with that it had already written the value of contracts at the amount of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of termination" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "skill Alcoas..." to ensure the melt or power supply to the melt, "not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force by November this year, even if it is yet a statement, why the contract is returned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts anticipate due to the poor economic conditions of the sector before the possible locking of the Portland melting ei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland generates around 900 megawatts and tomago to use roughly 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market, would mean a considerable decrease of demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And for us as a generator, it would not be good, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, it was the biggest attraction in Heathrow, just as it was in 2012 in London when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be able to achieve new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone, there are already 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment will prepare an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">As soon as they were ahead in London in 2012, there will be such that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will take us on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bikers had wrong in 2012 and they are wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answered every question.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the London Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an option to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in weaving growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to both the airport and the whole UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented caters of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third running steer, which is supported by £16 billion on private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the enlargement of Heathrow is also one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time we expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow and thereby creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it is looking for specific files such as Word-, celcel- or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards, the software presents the requirements of the legal notice.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of crypt Bitcoin - excessive.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private use is the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off, if a ransomce proposes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies registered sales loss due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to undergo the business activities completely, in case of one case humans were in life-danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by loss of ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say always the victims: do not pay, you're promoting the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult for managers to reject the claim of perpetrators in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good Reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers examined the user surface and contact with the presses and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or unturnkey for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be redeemed according to payments of a few hundred Euro, companies need to pay hard-negotiate and five-digit sums to withdraw their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risked winnings from the Ransomware-Erstress, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains safety specialists Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that three or four people are more likely.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software in the form of a software building to the actual stress.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were made by malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery is a adaptable tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says bisniewski. "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors are then seeking further hackers to spread the freshly collected software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a detective and commissioned another to install the software on the most many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inadvertised calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">Normally, the criminals then apply spammer with natural spread, "says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better back up their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies-IT-makers in the Maldonytes survey trust that Ransomware can move to a file backups and scan software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data is no sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data as such as customer lists or prikalkulations," explains "" "" Malachi-Chef Marcin Kleczynski "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the damages are still higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could take completely new objectives on the internet of things to come to grain in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackers Conference Defcon demonstrated that they could get a thermomentary thermostat with its control on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the brushcutoff of a dermatted heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in the future because of the heating in the future, Ransomek could also be a subject in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you can endure for ever, at night, one is for hours, so far in the wake of the wake up there is no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleeping disorders and over ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many reasons based, emphasises Hans-Günter Weert, member of the German Society for Sleeves and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result, the Insomnia is undergoing, so the Insomnia is unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that breaks out many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German house medical association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychic or negatively conditional factors, but also medications are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not seldom, the disorder of a different disease is rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake up is often often with depression," says White.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can be bad, akes all two to three hours, and starts blamily at all everyday problems and points to salts, there is also an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when to sleep with sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't sleep well over a month with a month in at least three nights per week and on the day they should go to the doctor to take a Weak.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is abbeaten, tired, unbroken, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has swings fluctuations or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, among other things conduct changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in the exceptional case and not at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of interdisciplinary dormitory health care centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore it should be possible to contact sleeping any problems at the medical specialist.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to sleep in sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in a sleep laboratory medical advice for example, for example, in case of snoring with respiratory system, at number of diseases or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping trough, fixes.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a lunch." says Figaze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After joining the bed, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes by the body one can carry a nose goggles, a chest strap and a feeller on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can the problems get in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are rather many screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching television to sleep, alcohol and night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and not favorably.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilded, a few Lindenbaths, in between still another headquarpavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works on the first glance at the first glance, but the police counts it among the "hazardous places" of the city.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "to the facade of a gray house someone has" ugly! "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which will also be demolished soon, it will be built until 2017: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trenant district," as the competent property company Friedrichshain calls, will be preferred by burning cars during the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the inhabitants of hire, however, have occupied rooms and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Particularly the Berlin interior of the Berlin interior had several occasions for a hard approach to the police, the area as "no-go-zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrolling parts of the street, closed parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house-owner houses the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers moved under the jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">During this summer afternoon the road appears peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the mayor in front of the houses in the sun, others maintain prem späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects, there are an elementary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left Violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in pine trees since 1999, and Jana *, who are living here three children, are mainly by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood projects they share the concern of increasing revenues and centered.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a pine, who wish to terminate the majority of the police from the vanding left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin's inner ensator and the police, make up their neighbours, obviously doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional working class that is, even today, compared to the rest of the city a lower average number of income and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house selections and the resulting living projects belong to the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in former GDR, among them almost the entire mainstream road near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared by a real road battle in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigid and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and electuers from all over the world: with them, residents of the GDR times and former house occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable during the rent, which has increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigid are attacked as symbols for these development: one recognizes them from the discs or freshly painted facades, which were subjected to color wraps.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this that not all neighbors who have been considered to be a problem, could not be imply affected by the crime: offenders as human rights are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make nondamage, and tends to meet the newly built new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94, there may be no speech of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence is concerned, it is essential: people in the 94 are their neighbours, they don't have this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars, there are no longer in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal offpoint, on the contrary: "here one can help one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is aware of the Rigaer Street, and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important to get back the residents of their road: from the police, the politics and the media, which suddenly stressed the Deutrioheit across the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to carry them away: by healthy new buildings in former building gaps, which push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there are finally condominiums, which are not interesting for many, - here are people living not so well," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I can absolutely not be guilt."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if a man never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustrations on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For people who like to engage with sticky bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever moves, should be aware of this - just like a man who goes into a pubs, there are poorly complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only having given names were asked, not to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, it is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social Pedagogin supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It can be seen as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, labor costs refugees, authorities, authorities and those else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the honors are more than thankful that Deuterle is now there, the pure wool mildew that has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking as much rather than looking for the multitude of task-targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We searched for a management team with a talent for languages and people combined with a long-standing experience in the area of social work, just a pure wool mildew.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it's about organisation, work with the people on site and behind the scenes as well as network drives.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in operation for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point on the basis of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle Ehren- and authority was supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to find apartments for the connecting fleets that have been recognised for some time.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are competent.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate refugees in your own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation need to bear the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is to changes from the council with local community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work until now, unless you are invited to private apartments, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the official apartments must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the basin.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine client and Annika Deuschle one.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay, there are placements, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and outaging activities for refugees and migrants who have to be established or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customers.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do-profit work - and the motivated and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the industry leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people have to develop an invarious feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So special offers like sport, contacts with domestic and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So please skip here to management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain the refugees that it takes, and they can take the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever will stop using the feeling he could not help in Urbach, wouldn't work and be unprofitable, he will never have to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority may be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem exists, but also says the customer honestly, "People who are not doing anything." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two fearful fear of radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clear," "" "what manure can call" "". "there can be a residual risk and if they don't want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the terrorist attacks they had to be in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they are nothing to do," "" "says Regine Customers." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honesty have to look at the location and in the area of activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always in the background that soon a new store may come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we did not come where we would like" "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the urbacher has already used to fully integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them are both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
