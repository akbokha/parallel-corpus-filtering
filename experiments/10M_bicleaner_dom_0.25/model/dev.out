Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of international agreement as well as Te@@ hran &apos;s dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
the encounter was also said to have a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se since years .
Washington har@@ sh@@ ly critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and will cast Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s poor lack to the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama by the Obama &apos;s Iranian nuclear program has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu was sent to the invitation of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress a controversial say@@ ings , which was judged as a ape against Obama .
the talk was not spoken by Obama , but a meeting was rejected with the election in Israel for the time of his time .
in a emergency call , Professor to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb , with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ ying voice of the police , shot that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and had to come to his house .
I think it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; was alive and likely to be excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials took Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note written on a white block : &quot; I felt so tired , I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no reference to that , in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississi@@ ppi , he had already left 300 miles to the school grounds , where he left the police a popular story of history , E@@ than Schmidt who murdered and killed at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sign@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that the university staff listened to the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that I had taken the cat@@ astroph@@ ic record at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : when the police took him , he took him away .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of it , what Lamb is motiv@@ ated .
the details that were published by the Agency on both ends of the State , as well what students and employees who knew him , helped us to draw a picture of talented , but probably difficult teachers .
students said they were looking around on his classes .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , did not have any history of violence or criminal history .
God himself mentioned the book written in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both departments became involved in the Department of Social Sciences and History , comprising 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some n@@ uns on problems with problems .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised the Lamb , said that he was also a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that every lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
I had previously asked the Delta State University for an ass@@ essing for health reasons and said that he didn &apos;t have any health problem .
this year he had only two online courses .
latest changes in employment policy of the university significant that the promotion , for which I had worked so hard for him , was not able to display an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
these are the questions that I can &apos;t answer anymore .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Trail as he drove back in Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , self @-@ killed self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Bal@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the drive .
it was not immediately clear why the lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew the people who lived there .
Lamb rises in the area .
Lamb started up his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants , teaching Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ agog@@ y .
he wrote his doctorate in Spring in Ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him a smart , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said it was 15 and it was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool guy who lived a few years to join her guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm then at that time .
all girls wi@@ ped out when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and pr@@ un@@ es were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call I said &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick building , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends left and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the bottom , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met ; but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that she was interested in music and blues played .
record I met Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared three years ago in a summer months market .
later they played together one or another G@@ ig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter dies and sings their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , which worked online for different companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment ordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he ended the Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ning Night in the night 5 September , after he had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic game before a late audience .
there was no evidence that anything did not agree .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were on the dream and jo@@ king .
I mean , they both had a good sense to j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , guided the first @-@ term seminar program and specialized in American u@@ cle@@ ans and colonial history , Don &apos;t Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and held President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ commemor@@ ating ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ly &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the m@@ ahn@@ wake , while the university professor &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
classes are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to be@@ ak the fact that the police informed me that Jesus had shot the not@@ ary of his death , and that Lamb kept himself in his emer@@ gen@@ cies as his wife , but there is no indication that the two had ever got married .
Toys R Us plan to set out less labor for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it is not so many Christmas season employees such as the last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will work with him employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater wait for the roy@@ als , and I perceive that the seat is empty beside me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit beside me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in mind that I am an sim@@ ulated staff and a arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a Date .
back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
back for the Future &quot; 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ ates the biggest time travel film that has ever been filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
back in time &quot; back to V@@ OD , DVD and selected cinemas in October will be shown .
UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only be bl@@ ame for millions of people .
the UN leader calls for once again all parties , including the split UN Security Council to unite , unite and integ@@ rative negotiations to finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the foreign minister of the five member states of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ del@@ eting of the general meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compl@@ ained that the insur@@ rection in the Council and the Regional Po@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation inv@@ get@@ able for this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity by the crisis of the crisis in Syria , which they have proven during the submission of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 re@@ frac@@ tive values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to sign him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to withdraw Donald Tr@@ ump from the top r@@ ots in p@@ olls , but it did not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of the real estate business .
of course it is too early in the electoral term .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts feel that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership in the rising of Herman Cain was delivered in 2011 , and none of whom also won a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he would have had to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and start to run their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current circumstances which indicate that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not only a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps core values have been turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ s saw the real estate in Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion from Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these numbers keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of ro@@ gue .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidate .
in a CNN / OR@@ C study last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; off@@ ended &quot; when it would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son said about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent that say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in things to look like ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ ying &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not see tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ ber and dic@@ tive statements , 52 percent of those who have rep@@ ublic@@ s ten@@ ding Irish voters think that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul says the right annual ch@@ ment for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first country @-@ country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has given the personality to a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet , 44 percent think that he did not have the privacy to execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 accidents say that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors used to be acc@@ ust@@ omed to the idea .
when in order to expos@@ e their schol@@ ars , Republi@@ can elec@@ torate can van@@ ish for real .
if she is asked who those who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from the last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since that time , when four of ten sent out their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would gain the nomin@@ ation by just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters will view Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bly .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered together a different candidates , Tr@@ ump still strike them almost every day .
some experts predic@@ t that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leader during the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump , harv@@ ested the majority support .
in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally back to border Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business@@ man with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a close @-@ out of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday , showing that only slightly more than half of voters want to support Tr@@ ump , say that they have firmly given their voices .
naturally , much has happened to change that , and nobody can really say to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door to move to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment , the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their opinion , are twice as often as Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump has been called &quot; R@@ ape &quot; to immig@@ rant in his electoral campaign two months ago , the emig@@ ration was shooting and fishing in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the st@@ icky originate from Tr@@ ump of His@@ p@@ ano @-@ American from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will keep away from Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and destro@@ ying the restructuring efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as long as the Immig@@ ration remain in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will also appear to do it too .
the fru@@ str@@ ations of the government climbed to new limits .
in the meantime , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly caused by their c@@ lich@@ és status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they &apos;re also ra@@ ging in Washington .
a pol@@ l of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ al . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the Five exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg are the most expensive community residence - with view over the North Sea coast .
in the street there is a square meter apartment on average 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer to objects in nature is limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special layers are a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; League has published a ranking of the most exclusive German site @-@ sites - with angular prices thanks to a di@@ zz@@ ying high altitude .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , attention .
but good , who can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is as an exception here , not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream boot thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pir@@ a@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a fortun@@ ate hit by Thomas Müller was paved with FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then he ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ ze have given a dream start in the &quot; mission Milan &quot; with FC Bayern in the wit@@ ch@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coach P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her tak@@ eover in the Champions League at the Greek public champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ cm + 2 ) and ol@@ at@@ ry found ( 8@@ 9th ) at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twelve star success in series should be the first step towards final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally go to Munich on the third run@@ way to Munich .
in his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Mi@@ th@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who was going to pass a f@@ lange of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game at Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is @-@ Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich @-@ kept word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and eng@@ aging performance , without shiny .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them with renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled likewise .
however , Bavaria , who defeated seven European ac@@ companies with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they were bra@@ ve to work with their offensive effort but often too influential independent efforts .
the attacks were often transferred to the left side by playing on the left side , Douglas Costa , who rarely passed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ abor@@ d@@ ell@@ lo .
by the right hand , Müller had more happiness than its flan@@ k from the right half @-@ point in the left gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of them had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown sm@@ elled the ball of Poland on the line ( 26 ) .
afterwards , by direct arrest , the go@@ al@@ keeper with the k@@ nee should be par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern dominated her usual game , Pir@@ dee was able to put a con@@ i@@ dot .
but Manuel was looking for a keeper .
as he ran a shot of ide@@ ye over the lu@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
first , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola filed a qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Go@@ ze , back mus@@ cular problems back in the box , sat at first outside .
the World Cup has not given the green light only after finishing the final training , &quot; Sport@@ y Matthias Sam@@ mer said &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , it has already been mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
even at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the distant Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ ton , Müller continued to set up .
in front of the game , it was come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly coated , Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block evi@@ d@@ ently demonstrated the followers of the host Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impact so@@ cks against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern fan was injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has higher risk to lose teeth
those who are smo@@ kes , not only the l@@ ungs , but also teeth - reveals a Pots@@ damer long @-@ term study .
good news : when w@@ ai@@ des , the risk provis@@ ion@@ ing decreases quickly .
smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this goes out during a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking the risk of smokers should lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to lose the 2.5 @-@ 3.6 @-@ factor higher .
scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ation of the g@@ um , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss can therefore return to frequent fl@@ esh@@ g@@ ings with smokers .
not clear , however , to what extent do smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking at smoking may reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
but it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing back to the level of non @-@ smoking sin@@ ks , declared first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people of this , non @-@ smoking , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads to our insights into good health by up to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of age are meaning@@ less affected by DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier investigations had already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early dental loss .
the new long @-@ term study shows the findings .

EU Commission proposes to fight new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral system to resol@@ ve the Power Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) .
the disputed private light @-@ air equipment for disp@@ utes between companies and countries are to be su@@ pers@@ eded by a transparent system that corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes in his function .
&quot; we want to put a system in which the citizens trust , &quot; declared the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Simp@@ ström when introducing .
the Swe@@ des has submitted the proposal to launch a European negoti@@ ating position in the US Free Trade talks in the US .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is supposed to be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see specifically that the EU countries and the U.S. will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment courtyard .
they are to be taken from the EU , the United States and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise up against prim@@ itive claim .
until now , the Trial Chamber involved one another on the arbit@@ rator , there was no obj@@ ection of the jud@@ gements .
in the discussion of past months , it has become clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment court in the long term .
there , for example , there could be clari@@ fied in disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries for example .
most of all major companies required by large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional refer@@ ral als are crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as a way of parallel , through the companies of pollut@@ ants resol@@ ves the tax@@ pay@@ ers to break national laws or cut consumption of consumer and environmental standards .
in its first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations and camps recorded by the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as in@@ adequate .
the trade agreements with Canada has not been critic@@ ised for the already challenged free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
however , the German economic state Secretary Matthias Le@@ nig ( SPD ) directed the plans in contrast to other progress .
the Commission was driven into account for the Reform of essential points , Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring with other EU trade ministers in spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the Plans &apos;s Plans .
the European business association business Europe warned against restrictions the cl@@ usal of the economy by too many new rules .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Questi@@ onn@@ ade
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s logo has been expected
the new Labour President Jeremy Cor@@ bu@@ n will debut his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Questi@@ onn@@ ade and place for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is going to rise to the first of his six questions shortly after noon , whereby his power is likely to be reviewed by the media and the Labour government .
he called &quot; less Theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary election for Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s leadership , because it comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ir@@ ine and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the sin@@ king of the National hy@@ mn at a memorial Celeb@@ ration for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes to provoke a review of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S and stands in the center of several Tit@@ bits Stories in the Newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention to
&quot; &quot; &quot; a man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood in a respec@@ t@@ fully silence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ en Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , which he chose the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and it acts on dis@@ agreements in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parliamentary Party were originally supported as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements are &quot; st@@ ack@@ able within Labour &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s outline on the position of the European Union and the limit at winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that Labour is preparing to remove all the idea of a limit .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of working and pensions , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds on 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth corporate president to David Cameron , ever since he was T@@ ory boss since he joined T@@ ory boss in the last decade of the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
the Labour President promised that he promised &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr. Cameron and given to him more than 30,000 ass@@ ump@@ tions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the body @-@ dogs of the Prime Minister be con@@ front@@ ative and that he is rec@@ lining both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact strength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the stri@@ ites with resist@@ ors and to focus on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow minister , will represent him if he is not particip@@ ates - for example , if Mr. Cameron is on the road .
he also has the idea to talk that other colleagues would occasionally support the word , and that John Ber@@ ry , the spokes@@ man of the home @-@ house , said to en@@ grave the problem .
when he was chief in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he was involved in the style of a &quot; cas@@ ual @-@ theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but some years later he found that he failed in it .
as they first aired in television in 1990 , the crew was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the judgment and his leadership in the House and his position among his parliamentary report , although critics argu@@ ed , it was become a car@@ ic@@ ature and deliber@@ ate the reforms .

pounds increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has already spr@@ int to data that indicate an increase in salary growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to that , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 has been increased by the fe@@ ot@@ s@@ target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
the percentage had been the fastest and raised income since 2009 at the time of interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1,@@ 5@@ 505 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the tremendous share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer by the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world , and bring brands such as Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were encouraged by the competition Group for luxury goods at Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
one of the most recent sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore increased by 5 % after the Berg@@ bau@@ ri@@ ese said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share of shares as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the German Packaging and Paper Group MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sachs attracted its estim@@ ation for the company Rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after having reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.6 million for the first half .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages in expansion will end@@ anger the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this buying power will balance the higher labor costs of his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and that could mean that there are no fewer jobs .

Pegas@@ i@@ da poster depic@@ ts the potato @-@ driver idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both both - and in the potato @-@ woofer , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger restaurant owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
inspired by the expression &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner , on a poster of the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato has closed its meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster in a Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had a chance to see on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has been to register its patent in Munich at the Patent Office in Munich .
there , it has been protected as a utility patent since recently .
so how much flesh and how much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer , doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Al@@ h@@ ay .
just as much : &quot; it tast@@ es even better , &quot; he finds .
even during its customers , the culinary international understanding come well .
Met@@ cash is launching the kick @-@ off campaign on the fight against algae sei@@ zu@@ res
met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ up campaign launched to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di offers the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over the Social Media , as well as Events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ Distribut@@ ors and suppliers are jumping on board , associated with brands such as ice @-@ manufacturers , composed of D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A stores samples and store owner , the associated tickets for the South Australian football League at faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the whol@@ es@@ aler conduc@@ ts its annual investors strategy on December 29 .
it is much in the game , because South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of h@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop business and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley reported that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away , but mainly independent retailers can take away .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley claimed that IG@@ A retailers could lose $ 360 million of turnover per year and will lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery stores with a high fixed cost reduction of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost an amount of $ 13 million before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ mat@@ h said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most likely .
Morgan Stanley is expecting met@@ c@@ ash@@ s in the food and grocery market by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business@@ man in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash rejected it publicly to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contact Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , while income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food@@ stu@@ ffs and food trade , which is about 1,200 IG@@ A retailers , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 , refl@@ ecting the operating debt reduction in revenues and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholesale dealers will invest over $ 150 million to deliver sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week to improve and deliver IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores due to increasing growing fresh foods and to deliver better choices on private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and load remedi@@ ation programmes are expected to settle and hopes that the major dealers will return to profit again in 2017 again for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi coconut B@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ o@@ ac@@ is ear@@ ns more praise than cr@@ iti@@ que for its behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deser@@ ved to view the President of the Australian tennis @-@ association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ u@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; , was caught because of the not@@ ori@@ ous con@@ frontation with C@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters into the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualification for Cincinnati shortly afterwards , Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice with the refer@@ ee , having beaten us : &quot; WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have had to strike C@@ yr@@ dom , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he crushed a tennis bat , after a cr@@ steam had failed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ o@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I quite er@@ d@@ ful is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken one bat less than he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ on in the US Open , but he is not the first player who destroyed a bat of Fr@@ ust with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has in the US Open extremely well , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe that he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he never seemed to be a problem with the other players who is always trained hard , it &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves it to be judged by his own services .
He@@ aly was also supported by the decision to take into consideration the decision to take into account the decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; than the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term goal to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on competition , and not all around the tro@@ tro@@ users around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think that Nick very quickly made the asc@@ ension of people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . it is rising up in the eyes of the public , and he finds some worst errors and deser@@ ves all the criticism that it can think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency bed and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all that tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants were in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land Islands and Serbian officials responded to indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence , set up for an unknown period in a rural strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built up there and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
as a police helicopter spread over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and they cried with the Hungarian will@@ ing@@ ness against Hungarian will@@ ing@@ ness .
some estimates from protest food and water back .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants coming back to Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral .
in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in Prague , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic &quot; in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels to make no common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had sought refuge in the capit@@ als Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have reached another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the influ@@ x of the continent .
but Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a bal@@ m action from Brussels or his neighbours .
the emergency stood on Tuesday , in two southern regions , officials gave more powers to uph@@ old the crisis , so that they ha@@ lock and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ y@@ j@@ ar@@ unto said that his country is also necessary to build a por@@ cup@@ ine wire along its border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants over the country - after that it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the last months , Hungary is for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East became a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an input point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed to it that the majority of the upcoming economic refugees who are in search of a better life , and not war refugees , are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into effect at midnight in Hungary , take on the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high gate , to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , led to a crime . these laws also bear severe pen@@ alties for human traff@@ ickers .
&quot; due to the situation that originated by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; said President Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but repor@@ ter from Associated Press have already seen anti @-@ armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said authorities 45 people in attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come over by destro@@ ying the fence , they are now in police custody , and accused of off@@ ences against the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence .
in Tuesday morning there were also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train ride with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos led the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary was opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and pressed a crowd of crowd to push down there .
about 20 succeeded to get caught , but thousands left off .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would like to use food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s ledge ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race to nomin@@ ation a national level , but sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton now has support 47 percent of democratic voters during preliminary election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rising by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced that he is responsible for the presidential system , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the election .
more than five months before the beginning of the preliminary election , most democratic voters predic@@ t that it is too early to say that their ad@@ visory opinion is sure that candidates will help them .
but Clin@@ t supporters are more stable than one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost some winn@@ ings at a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders scored some winn@@ ings .
Clinton holds a lead over women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections are reduced .
their support for the men is clearly reduced , and there is no other one here with 5 points .
Clin@@ t beneficial in democratic voters under the age of 50 years has p@@ ou@@ ched , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton has a huge advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the country are saying that they would be backed by enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some pre@@ ference and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are stronger with those who currently not support Clinton - only a quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters will say that they were willing to help others , less republi@@ can elec@@ torate say this about their peak beam Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supporters are asked in an open question , why they want to be the correct answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman was president ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
the Clinton &apos;s support association is also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement relating to the handling of problems and elec@@ torate is also quoted .
since the vice president th@@ rows the potential for the presidential office in the balance of arms , 57 % of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes it should not do it .
if the voters are asked by the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den at the top .
with Clin@@ t &apos;s don@@ ors more than half that bee had their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
decides that Bi@@ den , not decided to can@@ dic@@ ate the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton thus increases from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters are considered to have the best chance to win the election with the best chances of winning ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 per cent over the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has increased .
nonetheless , at the question of what is more important at a candidate , Democratic voters call questions of voters .
alike in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate is the un@@ acceptable candidate for voters .
the Democratic candidate , or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of their party .
well , Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy and st@@ worthy of strong guide qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the leader best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s tons is assi@@ mil@@ ated .
thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the preliminary elections see general Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , roughly a quarter of the democratic ten@@ ants have no opinion from S@@ anders .
since qu@@ eries of Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as an Secretary of State , most Democratic Vot@@ ers are pleased with their declaration of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans is now un@@ happy with their statement , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y did not have any impact on their general approval of Clinton , although 36 percent said they still have deterior@@ ated their mind .
they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views are worse than Clinton .
although Clinton had seen from the voters of their party as hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it remains a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent are seen as hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voters think they do not comply with hon@@ our@@ able and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote country are not frank@@ ly hon@@ est@@ ly and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , obtain good notes on tour .
out of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush were the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority look quite honest , but as at Car@@ son , many have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the survey sample of 351 German voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves back to nationwide p@@ ump behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times head@@ line behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two Candi@@ dates have meanwhile accounted for half the support of voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatic increase
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors are still in large numbers . support is growing at 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was carried out prior to Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son out@@ performs well in demo@@ graphic groups and is sur@@ passing as a ump in republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , except of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Kas@@ i , has fallen down with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who has fallen below the deepest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
the former governor Governor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C pol@@ l , which has been published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ s , behind the ump of 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also demonstrated dr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
at a glance at the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side th@@ iev@@ es for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son himself ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign of campaigns in I@@ owa .
pleasant beach temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even when peak values are measured at distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is already sufficient for a trip to the Mediterranean , in order to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a more short term at a maximum of 17 degrees .

five of the Brotherhood members bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a ch@@ ic@@ ane rit@@ ual as a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be a murder against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood can brutal attacks in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police to his death .
officials said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly att@@ acking , while he tried to wake up over a frozen field on a target . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell to un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , such as the police .
they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing to exchange his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to advice Council , said Ed@@ named Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle above that of Michael den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief of Police Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ve , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g repe@@ ats repeatedly with bl@@ unt @-@ strength injuries on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died each year in the har@@ ass@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in a declaration .
bro@@ th@@ erh@@ oods and its members must be drawn to ac@@ coun@@ table ; and this stage of authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury organized an indictment due to murder of third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , will also be charged with evil attacks and formation of a criminal case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only responsible for the participating people , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this has also been sanc@@ tion@@ ately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases its interest
a zinc @-@ cav@@ ity comes , and the number of goods sh@@ amed into account , R@@ end@@ ition is to be bor@@ row@@ ed for bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long this will last and how long it is to hold .
in particular , the history for the economy does just give low instruction to exp@@ iry .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate , and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve at the increase of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor will react like the economy and financial assets .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so fierce that investors ur@@ ges not focusing on what they begin to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could determine that the whole off@@ ence could possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of a zinc deficiency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is in@@ sof@@ ter of some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US Inter@@ est to normal altitude , but still on a low level to control the seis@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there is no effect .
here is an important historical trend , based on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of zinc @-@ caves may take care for a while .
once the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to decrease assets from 12 to 24 months after the first rise , which is reflected once again the delay in monetary policy , said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study to what has happened after interest @-@ caves of the F@@ ed .
in more detail , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to zinc @-@ caves , quite flat in the 250 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , CEO plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , was published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to act later in the Incre@@ ase cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often boost it often .
in the current case the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a zinc hei@@ ght@@ iness of the F@@ ed .
according to the Deutsche Bank , 118 Zin@@ c &apos;s claims had been accounted for by the nominal GDP at just 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015 , only few are expected that this will remain and anticip@@ ate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter after the realization of Atlanta F@@ ed .
zinc @-@ caves at a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; If this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken up all the year to a zinc hei@@ g@@ ings of the F@@ ed and all eyes were directed to the general meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that week that will end on Thursday .
while many Strat@@ ov@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could agree on an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a likely chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all high @-@ performance cycles from 1950 to today had taken place in a super cycle with increasing the GDP of GDP and re@@ vo@@ iced by re@@ vo@@ irs during the beginning of recovery in the shade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is am@@ big@@ uous recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , whom the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l since the market takes interest rate , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
as a result , the R@@ end@@ ites seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle is made .
at the end of the Incre@@ ase cycle , the shareholders are immediately falling asleep , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Sw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead that yields from longer @-@ shorter and shorter bonds to result in a de@@ fl@@ ation of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds bring usually better yields in such a climate even though . &quot; we still are careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ in , in a analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there is some evidence that the market has adjusted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the far@@ th@@ ur@@ ve , lending , lending has increased and increases vol@@ at@@ ility - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy .
in the large and entire company , companies carrying the greater part of their business activities in the United States , benefit from interest rates and attractive local products .
multin@@ ational corporations and high debts are worse due , since a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ ds to respond extremely positive after an initial rate hike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a strong balance sheet , companies have exceeded the average annual score after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ at@@ ility at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with a lower quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
consumers outside the pure stock levels will also benefit from the increasing dollar .
Spar@@ er could see gains of higher yields , even if experts different from different opinions , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew Bin@@ gham
the Con@@ serv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is becoming increasingly different from commercial ni@@ vals .
he also co @-@ led to the BBC Music Awards and said they just received The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins , the sending The Voice to and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of parliament and boo@@ sts new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something of doing what the private broadcast@@ ers do not do .
the conservative MEP Andrew Bin@@ gham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ caster radio station &quot; evap@@ or@@ ated &quot; and is not increasingly well @-@ known from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; susp@@ icious &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also worked on the BBC Music Awards , starting in December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to include The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples , where you actually only quote what is on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ gham said .
BBC general director reported the accus@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 shows far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music playing , which is really unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music to be found and new works may be commissioned , I think also really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey came to work on the har@@ der to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British are informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media , and sport for it under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on its feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice to the BBC , the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Shopping and Boy George as Judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC @-@ mode .
he added , he wishes to find that the company was hit a hit from our house in the house , &quot; when it star@@ red the next time .
however , he refused to include the order of further rows of The Voice in the future , or put money to the applicant for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August , the slow@@ est , and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for sale
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been drilled , and many of the Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into a gh@@ ost town .
but experts say that there is no evidence that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there is evidence that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and then , in the course of time , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sales survey to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago , as a buyer for purchases , with its mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example , at home on the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now , one comm@@ utes a way , and we may see that growth is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon from America was imported as one reason for downstream sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases on the last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buyers boo@@ sts their computers in order to make their bar@@ gain , and few tra@@ ders over@@ threw their dealers .
experts believe that Black Friday , in whom the Bu@@ yer could im@@ pe@@ de for bar@@ gain , buyers might be unable to make purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium took out that £ 5 spending money was spent on £ 1 £ 5 .
some products such as television and washing machines will now be carried out more than one @-@ third of purchases over web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buying clothes and shoes online instead of in buying houses in the ones of the ones .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca for the crane accident Sh@@ red@@ eten - Bin Laden &apos;s family
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first be@@ aters in Mec@@ ca by the roads
Saudi Arabia sets off the collapse of the enormous Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims assembled themselves , when 29 of the victims were killed by the streets in order to bury them that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca .
this firm survived , largely in white , the way to tender their respect , when the first of the dead stood their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ren@@ aissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the fun@@ eral pro@@ cession passed by the Holy Sites , where only days earlier a building crane collap@@ sed by the ceiling of the mosque and then over@@ thrown onto the bed .
the bodies were approved for the assessment as the Saudi King above the building company of the Bin Laden because of the cat@@ astrophe , which caused 3@@ 94 injured , a sanctions imposed .
the bodies of 29 bet@@ s that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central African Mak@@ k@@ az , were driven by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was a father of four children who jum@@ ped on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual h@@ iller .
Saudi &apos;s officials already pointed out that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca by thousands who continue to come to the city will continue .
today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group would have shou@@ ldn &apos;t let the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arab version of L@@ gs , which was published by the government Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English language service in the News Agency reported not this detail , said that the company &apos;s leader abroad may be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to un@@ veil what was caused by the fall of the sick who collap@@ sed in a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ cau@@ sea , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrested in front of the p@@ addle who later takes place in this month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group had no statements on the collapse of the sick , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Decree also provided the group because of no current safety measures and because they have not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of Kr@@ ates encomp@@ assed Mec@@ ca Gross@@ mo@@ z@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over longer construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a mad son who had escaped from the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in am@@ id@@ st winds and rain , only a few days before arrival from millions in the Kingdom for a pilgrimage that is needed at least once every healthy match .
officials said that 158 people stay at the hospital .
government representatives stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the members of the killed , and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheapest Eastern European crafts@@ men passed by
Brit@@ ons spend more and more tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe divided a rise
this means that 200 other screen @-@ fix shelves , which are to be seen on tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales will close together nationwide
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Head @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Brit@@ on show their hammers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favour of the deployment of qualified host@@ els , which do work in their home
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to hit walls , you really belong to a minority .
for Britain increasingly employ workers to perform DIY jobs in their houses , leaving the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the tree @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed chain , said that a large increase in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services to lowest prices may be over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more screens and close to tra@@ des@@ men and close to 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said they would deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , than eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment the men weigh over at the moment .
she said it was necessary to present the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it is still working a majority of men in our stores .
we must move this to a balance .
basically , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also engine@@ ered their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company , who occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - there is a key topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher re@@ reported a decline in Half @-@ Year Award and the operations , after the group had the cost of sending the shops .
because of its trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches .
Lab@@ elling of a@@ I / DO@@ B because of failure in Court
at the regional court of Klagenfurt , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball @-@ Viz@@ em@@ master a@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer because of un@@ faithfulness and play@@ ability .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with counter@@ claims .
he was acquitted on effect from this alleg@@ ations in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel discovered in the preliminary investigation that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of United States between 2006 and 2011 , where they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage is about 400,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also indicted for financial statements .
this fact was the chairman of the Court of Justice , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ able at a later date .
the defence case , however , issued the defence that the association was not in charge of a wealth project at no time .
the sports officials would have been active only on the expenditure and the sports club , for which it had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had spent much time and money , liabilities were financed by the liabilities ( approximately 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; then we stood before the situation : do we keep the club on or un@@ lock the club ? , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread calls for the financial authority .
he decided to take on this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have failed to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his capture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , only no debt may be made .
in addition , the payout on the payment of damages endu@@ red until 1991 was also contributed by the respective financial results .
therefore we have had a part of the compensation payments only years later , namely from 2003 , when an increase on the account was paid out .
so , shipped and un@@ detailed bookings , the former Ob@@ mann dis@@ courses the processes .
the two accused Ac@@ counts and Sav@@ ings Cl@@ ements the two accused , said the second accused .
why the withdraw@@ als of the association were not explained in detail , the judge asked .
the association was not interested in detail for financial support , so that only the freedom of debt has been , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club onto the association &apos;s account against an initial investigation .
these were rep@@ aid , the accused was .
it accounts for the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
this did not answer a question for a long time .
then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if something happens , nobody had known anything of this money , the prosecutor represented in the room .
the co @-@ accused was inform@@ ing , justified the function .
this transaction was formulated as &quot; claims for damages . &quot;
why call compensation ? , would you want to know judge and state attor@@ ney .
the first def@@ endant , that he had not understood with this formulation , had not been mis@@ understood , since the association ever had an damage to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the attor@@ ney says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the function , he has never drawn up a cent content , he only accounted for od@@ ometer money and di@@ ets .
however , with di@@ ets the association charged € 1,000 per month , but the actual effort , however , was much higher , added .
exact documents for the early years could not occur .

the second def@@ endant had also been killed .

Hewlett @-@ Packard - more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the ongoing workforce reduction , since the beginning of three years , the management of the company has been expanding further jobs .
no end has been found at the U.S. Compu@@ Ser@@ ving Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
the U.S. technology group plans to set down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers as part of its restructuring .
the company plans to be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special loading of about 2.7 billion dollars , falling down from the fourth quarter .
the ongoing mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs have been completed for three years .
HP had employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year .
in terms of stock , the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share accounted for 2.3 percent .
based on the California Palo Alto , a group of printing based in a new company , the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - split by the future advanced areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both companies are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC market , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services , deployed to the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ producer .
in the third quarter of July , sales of both PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the Ear@@ nings went back in 15 of 16 quarters .
hp answers with a break and massive level sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded to customers that customers buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are more than previous online .
Whit@@ mans re@@ training plans see a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs in total .

for other states , air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive .
24 percent of them are to interv@@ ene in the conflict .
however , in cooperation with the Syrian government of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of the respondents , 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : demol@@ ition in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have used the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and the water designer to several hundred injured refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ Cor@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced violence against the border control point .
he reported about the telephone :
a group of refugees forced the border .
behind him , a polic@@ eman station@@ ed and behind the polic@@ emen were prepared .
40 to 50 refugees began with stones , sticks and plastic bottles to public officials .
officers were initially un@@ interrupted pep@@ per@@ mint .
thereafter the police used rub@@ b@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn something .
an pregnant and evi@@ d@@ ently last woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had in@@ hal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees caught up in himself and suffered under bre@@ aths .
pressing the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pep@@ per@@ mint .
time of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ Diplom@@ a
the world ob@@ serves when the US @-@ Diplom@@ a will meet at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the still last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates will be kept at this present status of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event since it &apos;s seven years ago , since the F@@ ed is interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach to a situation in which a large central bank could reli@@ ed down the zero area and a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is at a relatively low power base , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ uted outlook on global circumstances .
you have warned the markets to set a rise , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good .
the decision should be posted at 20.00 CET on Thursday
emer@@ ald ar@@ cher at the Delta State University after bl@@ aming
after the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Mississi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - before he later killed his colleague , Sh@@ annon said a note to tell him that he would &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could do it un@@ happen , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississi@@ ppi , said that record , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He has shot on someone and killed someone .
he said to the staff of the emergency call , that the police officer must send the police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but that &quot; nobody is bo@@ thered by &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb gave no explanation for his k@@ isses .
as a police entered the scene , Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note went out from 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the record said that Pr@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said the authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was proclaimed by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years when a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ un@@ iss had a daughter , who is 19 and it was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he worked online from home , according to the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of prints .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ ning that had a dog named Light@@ ning had met him for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said I have called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not into prison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers brought him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , coming up in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a kiss .
in Spring 2015 , Lamb was awarded a PhD in the University of the University of the University of the University of Germany .

Eu@@ ro@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group by
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of group .
in 2013 , the Lufthansa Group aims to save one million euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the worldwide approx . 1000 exec@@ u@@ tives will be generated in the workplace .
with the pilot network , there are new negotiations throughout .
the Lufthansa build its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates low @-@ priced int@@ row@@ ings .
the goal of real@@ ignment is an contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and placement syner@@ gies , part@@ akers on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no more executive board for passenger goods in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ ro@@ being should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in the Executive Board about Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich shri@@ mp@@ s will be responsible for eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of eu@@ row@@ ings , which the Group aims to compete in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet .
to date , the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees were complex .
the airlines will be renamed under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot of the pilot phase ( VC ) , negotiations after the judicial proceedings will be resumed on this Thursday .
that shared the union .
topic of talks will be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit speakers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year made with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faster results for sustainable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and air@@ line led to various strikes in the last months .
background is the &quot; Wings &quot; concept behind the transitional provision of the pilots .
it fores@@ ees a Lufthansa in the fight against cont@@ ested routes to the corporate owned airline Eu@@ ro@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play months due to double Fra@@ ction
Luke Sha@@ w suffered double Fra@@ gran@@ ting of his right leg at the Champions League &apos;s defeat in Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this is the left of the while , he brought to the weeping and exclu@@ des him for at least six months , Louis van G@@ aal gives hope not to play that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a not@@ ori@@ ous attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated at the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before it was hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg correction and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe a day later and then in Manchester under@@ gone surgery .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United comes very heavily , and then it happens fantast@@ ically , and then that happens .
in the changing cabin , he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double correction , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and a penalty of fine .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mexican .
van G@@ aal noticed that the Italian refer@@ ee had s@@ cour@@ ged .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ man and a red card were due .
it was a very deterior@@ ating attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et of Sha@@ ws began : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I &apos;m , my way to gen@@ esis begins now , I &apos;m coming back again . &quot;
in addition : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the British Defender has an additional inc@@ entive to recover from the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this kind of injury is leaving the place , all are very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you heard that it is a very worse injury , it is not good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only one I could see was the ball , who was in another direction , so it looked like &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 I said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how to feel it , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very well doing so sorry . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was transferred to the hospital , after a f@@ oul@@ ding of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you meet almost .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favourite child@@ r@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who founded in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , agile , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nicely and good , except that of the follow @-@ below , in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead of re@@ building a syn@@ op@@ sis of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to extend the quite short original text .
&quot; in the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air has gone a commod@@ ity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see her wish to see a real tree filled . &quot; a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss all@@ el and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that was not yet suspected , the text of Cameron &apos;s text reads , partially as the Sum@@ mary of the Lor@@ ax movies , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a product , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he too has to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron ev@@ okes the action of the book so little familiar . here , a wor@@ sen@@ ed boy , like the local environment through the ast@@ eries of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , s@@ me@@ tic creature , &quot; which is devast@@ ated in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a assistant that The Lor@@ ax did not read for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street Spe@@ aks said that the text might probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ke El@@ ection Office .
super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ us employees were delivered , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was very clear from the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
if you encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re , the England for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test defeat not on my map .
I would not close a forward win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Site is possibly more experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing installation , and the common spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a adol@@ escent setting .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develop as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
information related to this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course .
at his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ te@@ e@@ ers are targeted at the results .
there was no question mark by Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , as - and I said this before - players are their own best choices .
a long time ago , he had been extended over the course of Ly@@ th , but he had his own dest@@ iny .
if he hope to take another successive purchases of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even if he did not get so good achievements , and I &apos;m not surprised ; he is mainly a team man .
the question , how much time a test will receives around his sign , is difficult .
Ly@@ th was given seven chances of how Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was 9 .
only Comp@@ ton was the chance to do return and down@@ wards .
the only reason to be lifted up was that England initially caught Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a bu@@ zz@@ ard which I imag@@ ined .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ tor , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he scored 236 votes to us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s expansion in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een to cook for Cook , get it up for an extra spin punch and four Qu@@ icks , di@@ pped , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot beat there , and this left hand has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is not a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first Drop , before he appeared as an open@@ er in 2001 .
he instantly made three hundred p@@ uns , and looked not back .
afar Ans@@ ari enters the K@@ ader as a Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited relationship with him he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think , it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup pro@@ w@@ lers that raise their hands and the trainer have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England made a few smart additions to the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ t , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the testing games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the most common guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and into a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela did he take advantage of which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even when the news are in tune with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I haven &apos;t got a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team manufacturers do not determine the timet@@ able .
and you must remember that as with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not met with light hearts .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = out of Great Britain out of the EU ) could win the amount of ex@@ ag@@ eing if the economy plays in a fl@@ ashing device by 2017 .

foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at schol@@ ar , and told that some states , as deeply under@@ stri@@ pped in different crises such as the EU is now and not always made from their own fault , Great Britain itself created agenda with split quot@@ ations and distur@@ b changes that they are usually not needed .
in Brighton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not even if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb at Summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they are allies for reforms .

Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks too bad for it , as it happens in the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated endurance of how Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .

it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will become a ban to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British should avoid their energy better to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do , because most of the similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies did .
therefore , possibly , some such ministers may not int@@ enti@@ onally demonstrate help , completely in the SN@@ P style , while Great Britain &apos;s lec@@ tured campaign in 2017 may now accelerate my boy@@ friend .
&quot; the new hearing was a ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of the new hearing . &quot;
Europeans know how burning the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU @-@ sk@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the pressing ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , in 1975 , which was not supported by our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
it is possible to recall that Boris Johnson , the bronze Euro Opportun@@ ites , who formed a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Straight @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90s .
in all his rec@@ u@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley was part of the steering @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ instruc@@ tors who own most of our large newspapers .
actually , Tony Bl@@ air thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas in order to take him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he dis@@ agreed with Cam@@ er@@ son &apos;s referendum , because Bl@@ air had turned the principle on the not adopted amendments of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door .
he has never denied the press .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly reception on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems to repeat this danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott , the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and today .
it can last but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ h &apos;s official position to Europe - I press it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ an &apos;s tendency and wild animals of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can indeed say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; An Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and television this week said than the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ en dis@@ closure of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell having been a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father worked in television as an effort to be loyal to his Labour cabinet re @-@ shu@@ ffle , without going to go far and to lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , to remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ y expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , and what J@@ C told his fellow workers and dep@@ uties for all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the gl@@ and Bott@@ om @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n want to mediate , remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and particularly in the stru@@ del of the social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s right , Cameron is not giving freedom to freedom for Europe who allowed him to keep lab@@ ours assistance in speech en@@ vi@@ able for a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental multi @-@ purpose activities to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Belgian Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist relations - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ sidents who is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .

experts crit@@ ici@@ ze report by Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
the claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking developed from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; of the past month and describes it as an &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data in@@ quire and directed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the P@@ he established his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two further researchers have asked to write in BM@@ J , using the statement &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the efficacy of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public statement is that the current estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single meeting of 12 people , which were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ critical analysis analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) for providing their opinions on the damage of various Nik@@ ot@@ in @-@ half products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was to have received from British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the Refer@@ ences of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , said they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed on the meeting would receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that it should have received before reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International to receive them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also indicate economic financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco check .
at the meeting also the tobacco line of P@@ he participated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research group of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sur@@ passes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there will be no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations made by p@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes were permitted as one way to smoking cigarettes or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J re@@ acts this claim before .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his sear@@ ches .
all evidence suggests that risk of health risks of E @-@ cigarettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
P@@ he has the conclu@@ sive obligation to make public the public about what evidence is proved and not , especially when it gives so much public confusion over relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80.000 people die each year with regard to smoking , smoking costs the National Health Care System $ 2 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clear suggestions of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking by smoking , we comply with our National jurisdiction .
BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival to give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting charge will only be used to do the type of programs that will not be sent by other UK channels .
it crit@@ ici@@ zed the BBC that they are likely to see public broad@@ casts that probably are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard @-@ cont@@ enti@@ ous time window against the most popular shows of their rival and transmitters , like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC general director of Tony Hall , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried in touch for six years at Channel 4 without a success to join the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that to show the BBC programs in order , or that clearly informs clearly by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under his investigation into the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you don &apos;t want to keep the broadcasting charge , what I think about it or in the long term , it should be asked at least on programs that do not make or put it on behalf .
they send The Voice to a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a possible broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it is natural sense of sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is a such program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own @-@ production .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arms .
I stri@@ ve to see how that publicly @-@ legal television should be .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would even decrease in at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC will be on the hunt for ass@@ ess@@ ments , &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to guarantee long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular Shows of the BBC give that which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ lecture at Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal non @-@ legal system programs should go to BB@@ C4 as they are not able to measure their tasks , and they can argue that , though they have created all these sacred missions for justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window in which nobody wanted to see them .
for the broadcasting charge , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can receive the best value of it .
of course you think all , think that one gets a great value for £ 150 every year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC would examine her Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and maintain and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said only a bit of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % in the radio - and it should take part in the publicly @-@ legal television sen@@ ders in Australia and Canada . this is to be informed and chat .
on the issue of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television can be shown , and with commercial transmitters alli@@ ances to make all online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ze@@ Gen@@ etics can control brain cells using the sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ at@@ odes can change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified glass systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ odes will alter the direction in which they have sound imp@@ ul@@ ses , which are for higher frequencies to be stopped .
the imp@@ ul@@ ses work due to an en@@ roll@@ ment of mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms presented the power of a new procedure , called probe Gen@@ etics , by which ultrasound is used to activate a series of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian a laying down of a day the depths of brain stim@@ ulation could replace an inv@@ as@@ ive process called on electric pul@@ ses in the brain treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fas@@ c@@ ers generally respond not to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , enh@@ ancing the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate to the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves feature structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion @-@ duc@@ ts and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the th@@ rows .
the sound waves operate the opening of these icon@@ duc@@ ts and activate the cells which they are m@@ apped , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled em@@ at@@ odes , the Hal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified that some of its mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion @-@ duc@@ ts .
when he apply ultrasound on the changing creatures , the sound waves are reinforced through the micro@@ bub@@ bles and turn it into wor@@ ms , where the newly changed mot@@ ions are dis@@ connected .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool which allows scientists to dis@@ connect neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light and dis@@ abling .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ne@@ tics could have some advantages in comparison to this technology .
in contrast to light creating an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound scan may occur un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to trans@@ itory human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other applications , he could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student dormit@@ ory on a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have been off@@ ended - and the numerous , long @-@ fle@@ eing complaints about others .
most of the things I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence is made from easy to ven@@ ous sho@@ cking up to an absolute fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to s@@ lan@@ ting : people tell whence you are com@@ fy if you have taken away Sabbath year , where you do not love affair , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just one yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like in contrast to those , with which you would not speak , even if your lashes would be fire and these extingu@@ ishers would be .
let the people go .
the rooms of people often convert into beverages , Film / night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
3 . related : do not think of taking the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted a rough handling of the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student halls make up a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away to get the energy back I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a personal pol@@ l of soci@@ alizing is exhau@@ sted - and send it an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
talking about kno@@ cking : do you do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closing through baking .
since you begin the Uni at the peak of the Back Man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck at the doors of the Back Man@@ ie , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve contempl@@ ated you . so , now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made delic@@ ac@@ ies is a good way to close friends .
their minds are committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will associate their face with a pleasant surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a person b@@ aker .
bad mixed d@@ pumps made of flour , sugar and fat lead that people find sleeping when you anchor .
to steal food , a skilled crime is in residence halls .
of course the cl@@ aws of chick@@ ens is a theft , but is it the take @-@ take Mil@@ k for your tea ?
check it with the dairy shop .
the chances are good , they say they themselves to operate even if they cook in the inside .
if anyone ste@@ als your stuff is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to get more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added a dish@@ on@@ our to their milk to pun@@ y th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they shou@@ ldn &apos;t make noise , the people from sleep or out of work .
it is not merely to be a person of person , but that you belong to man in the tru@@ est sense of the right to man who sit in the glass of glass .
a girl in my corridor asked its neigh@@ bors , whether it makes them something big , watch &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even bre@@ aching music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos; clock , they were kin@@ dly allowed to sleep another two hours before she finished their own music , and ended their door , and sat down to her three hour exam .
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would fail to move into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
in addition , it would not be un@@ essential , if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouse in order to separate themselves and then take them every day and then perhaps experience , how they all draws together all common friends ?
of course , the heart gets its own ways - but if a hot fellow @-@ hab@@ itable is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try the least to talk about your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you consider that someone out its key in its in@@ closed room is the limit between a Ul@@ k and mob@@ bing f@@ one when it seems .
a good aspect is funny , but it takes only moments until it gets bo@@ omer@@ ang .
create a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never mind someone &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and place their keys into a glass of water which you then set in the freezer - but get your poss@@ essions in the ceiling no more than twice .
housing houses for refugees , solo trav@@ eler , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ener
the property owner Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner ental terraced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
so for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need residential space , as well as the alone rising mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ener . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to make it comfortable and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees to spend on the housing market .
business@@ man Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how fast affordable accomodation can be created : he builds in a project terraced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees to push for the housing market .
what solution can you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for humans remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee family we also need sufficient living space for decades .
a very thin , three @-@ storey terraced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row house needs a least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if people under@@ take people in residence blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three main units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees to say it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then , the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , excluding plot .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted for six months .
that is appropriate .
did the building regulations simpli@@ fy their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I &apos;ve been doing correctly by my project .
particularly complicated it makes the dro@@ pping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ a special construction and the placement regulations .
gr@@ um@@ el@@ ly .
the apartment is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities there is space for the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have been accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but are you not spar@@ ing the compet@@ itor to pay affordable appart@@ ments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is that : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but luxury apartments that can hardly be aff@@ ord in any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need residential space .
not only refugees , as well as the alone rising mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ener .
I show how one can easily and easily build it today .
this is why it is .

iOS 9 : as you get the new iPhone OS version when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking on &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are exposed to the installation , since they get an error message that means the &quot; software update was failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the trial .
this may possibly mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create room - but Apple has made it more likely to do this because it is easier to er@@ ase apps once you make a special tool , and then re @-@ install immediately when the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is re@@ charged during the update or is located in the vicinity of a charge unit , so the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple is not able to turn the update as the phone may termin@@ ate on half way and this could lead to a down@@ fall of updates .

approximately 2000 patients come to the Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll in the practical field of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in the North German practice level , there are approximately 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another clinic practice .
a positive side effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .

furthermore the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border checks are lifted by at our south border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel in parallel .
as of course , it is clear that everyone who wants to make an application for asylum , could also &quot; be &quot; of course . &quot;
the provision and safety of human beings is standing in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; the Minister , said .
people must know that we do not accept the bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considered &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would like to travel further refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and there were also cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
all so this Minister for Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . intensi@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian border with Croatia is however already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen Area .
as the Minister of Ministers , Slov@@ ene wants to avoid the borders for refugees but not inter@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted to travel in the night Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to travel to the registry .
in Croatian police , it was able to interv@@ ene in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles have been involved in new refugees .
the men were mainly for Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
fire services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country was expecting around 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian Border , which had been brought to the Hungarian border so far , passed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied that it was it that people an@@ ise to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , in any case , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the border region of Si@@ d , where further busses would be expected during the day .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were traveling through Serbia around 500 kilometres from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made us , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
it is now possible to pass the previous shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly lower west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive potential for limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic pointed out that his country is prepared for the case of a strong growth of refugees relevant plans for potential appro@@ ach@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t call him , but he pointed out that Croatia was as non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full possibilities for limit control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you lead to strict controls in order to qualify for the membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partner has since been consistently through a good testimony that concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side after the Hungarian border around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports they published the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities the two trans@@ itions of Hor@@ g@@ os and B@@ g Bre@@ g continue to remain fully blocked .
whether the remaining refugees continue to travel to the Croatian border , still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to calm Wednesday early at a local moment in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keep the debates about alternative rou@@ ds of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for bre@@ wing .
there are currently no longer a very high number of refugees .
they could not say if they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
tool rates migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private refugees who have already begun to distribute the refugees maps of refugees , where alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still cleared of min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police reported that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex lists mixed , financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the final quarter , and the Lie@@ utenant @-@ Gig@@ ant promised his earnings outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its market transport .
the company also said that she is planning to hire some 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation period .
the share was held by 2.5 percent in the market business 45 minutes before the opening ceremony .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said they earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than the previous forecast .
analysts expect according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower price comes despite the price increases , which will rise on average 4.9 percent , and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher charges for land transport of heavy and large par@@ cel , which will be charged starting from November .
the company said that , however , expect the result compared to the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher income and growth for growth in the online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides solid earnings when you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade .
the plans for vac@@ ations in vac@@ ations were announced a day later than the rival of the Riv@@ a@@ UPS , the plant plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra employees , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex promised 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , analysts were predic@@ t@@ asked .
revenue rose by 5 percent to 12.2 billion dollars .
six of cement plants cons@@ ulted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in the last few years F@@ ed@@ Ex noted a decline in international priority mail order to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in his unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent in the previous year , but the operating result was actually flat , due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express @-@ unit achieved higher income due to higher prices while the result was down due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
at the pre @-@ market trading , about one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at her most expected meeting in the year we spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table sitting to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to head the Leit@@ z .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story seat sa@@ vers is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a memory of that the F@@ ed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ell@@ ar and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order by the Congress : maxim@@ ise the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an in@@ written third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X factor in a decision to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they grow solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il could make the most c@@ res@@ cent F@@ ed representatives in the global financial markets , these vol@@ at@@ ility due to raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and is it only by one quarter note .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important part of it , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at Mak@@ ler@@ ei Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when searching for a pre@@ text , the interest rate has not increased , increased un@@ certainty around the global market enough to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed will do what is uns@@ ure on itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surveyed by Bloom@@ berg , have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed , with a key indication that shows only a 30 % chance on an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promise that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose at 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % at 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy controlling the sentence in this week said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at the Moody &apos;s Capital Markets segment Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does it , it would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , lest they get into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a zinc deficiency would calm the financial markets as it would act un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
one month ago the F@@ ed appeared to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow dis@@ appearances of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ell@@ as said in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the liber@@ als of liber@@ als , more economic progress would be necessary to increase the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed looks at full time .
wage gains have shown signs of recovery .
and even though , inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives had said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world pushed together at the end of the last month , after China had utili@@ zed his currency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dow Jones Industrial average value had dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would increase global growth .
this month , the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow is now reduced by almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation in complex calculation when you should increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US bank@@ note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty on what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authorities of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere reference of the then Chief Leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 said that the F@@ ed could &quot; hide their mon@@ et@@ ous expansion &quot; in the b@@ ulation of turbul@@ ences around the world .
in a world , in the markets and economies , increasingly sem@@ inated by the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , it can not only monitor the developments in other place , but also meet other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding for the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell said , Director of the global strategy for asset management in En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey Be@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , understood this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has made a history of over@@ actions to finance market movements that are not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
L@@ acker , a legitim@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , agreed for a Zin@@ c cav@@ ity , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its head@@ quarter by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions , despite restric@@ ting the impact on growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives left these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market leadership in 2008 said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il didn &apos;t come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely they will not run into the situation , in which they were afraid of interest , because the markets puri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not think that it should take time .

the Brazilian pap@@ al organization S@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women in the sho@@ cking way , how important food during the break @-@ time is . you do this with the presentation of images of babies , who are painted at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , that give babies every nutrients that need them to build a strong immune system .
because of the extra energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake does not have the only di@@ eting ability to make mothers .
a recent study conducted under the leadership of Robert Water@@ land , professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet variable women affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
remarks for the new Bern@@ ardo of Sports Hall
the municipal office of Bern@@ ried appro@@ ached the building contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he became an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ haul gym at the Bern@@ ardo Sports site is in step by step forward : in the most recent meeting session , the function@@ ed building contract has been un@@ blessed without great discussions .
previously , the panel of members agreed on an association with the valid development plan &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the saddle roof is expected to be built with a non @-@ cent@@ red First and roof par@@ ap@@ t .
the concept of planning is the fores@@ een use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; in this way , we get a wonder@@ fully large south roof , &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was again the roof of an attic that is prescribed for ener@@ ge@@ tic reasons - less than in the building area - below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore needed because the development plan does not notice a &quot; exceptions . &quot; whereby the entrance of the simil@@ ar@@ ders usually prescribed by the Liberation orders more restric@@ tive .
however , in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics , there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we are getting there no preced@@ ent , &quot; as St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ ast@@ ation construction at the sports centre is a community project of community and SV Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated 2.3 million euros .
grants will be expected by the training and width of the school .
in the next step of step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the State Council together with the inspection .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg clinic moving to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed more than planned - in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is at the same time as the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees take from P@@ ei@@ go@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
we see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the rural district , confirmed by Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
the Supervisory Board , however , will take a decision about this decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue .
the vast majority of fishermen to go through Fischer and the continuing interior stop at Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the staff that do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim , so j@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of the plans .
this change also triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only since the beginning of the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic , and now changes to private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital .
on the question of who is to follow Him , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to be ready to take over the bat@@ on from 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
in case of the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in every case a &quot; appropri@@ ation &quot; and an extension of the bid@@ ding in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alize in the internal area of g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team shall have to carry out both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ igh@@ ty , which has more than 35 beds , will eventually be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county was planned for 2018 in 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
land@@ lord J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ors met that the house , which is in possession of the Federal Council of Justice , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several thoughts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which better things could not happen ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this occasion did not happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as fishermen about the Qu@@ asi moved to the Le@@ ch , who had been positi@@ vely greeted by employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen work for more than 30 years as principal physician , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer @-@ colleagues to take over the item of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once more than 100 beds ) was closed again in the last decades of closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and birthday assistance .

hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously wounded while the ma@@ ize harvest died in the afternoon of the afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) there were several h@@ unters in use as the police hur@@ ried .
after a scra@@ ping , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered heavy injuries and were killed in hospitals .
just how it could happen to the accident , initially it was un@@ clear .
the crime Police re@@ determined .
mis@@ chief 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
the police have susp@@ icious the police on the remains of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the interro@@ g@@ ation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the young people killed and their bodies have been thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is missing a non@@ violent race from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
the young woman was found at the evening evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as Public Prosecutor and police on Wednesday .
as an energi@@ p@@ ite is also the 20 @-@ year @-@ old at the Monday evening , who , according to speci@@ fying , led and investig@@ ator led to the excav@@ ations of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been officially reported on Sunday morning , after having not agreed to come home after a visit to the festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of his young woman , the investig@@ ators first beat on personal items of the victim .
after questi@@ oning in the friends of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ance of the mis@@ chief , a murder against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally considered .
the alleged off@@ ender successfully led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the bodies were found .
according to the authorities , the authorities were said to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police and put the dead bodies into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators place a man@@ slaughter .
conclusion over the facts of the facts will bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against homes
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is a challenge in front of a challenge .
the distribution system in the German residential building has long since begun .
with the older refugees and employment search from the EU , more people push more people on a market that already over@@ bur@@ dened in many major cities .
they compete with income @-@ income citizens for the last paid appart@@ ments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable homes , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this result , a study was commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Hou@@ sing Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees have no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers in a premi@@ er accommodation .
many of them stum@@ ble onto the apartment market and lined up in the long gravel in front of the apartments .
however , according to the statistics , last year less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were rent .
however , the negative development of the apartment market is not just in the rising refugees .
the study also makes serious adverse events in housing developments of recent years .
Germany &apos;s move a residential dispos@@ ition out of itself , which is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study , is currently missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
there were therefore many working groups in large cities , listed in WG rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily due to their flat in the apartment market for longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in big cities the number of square meters per capita has sunk again for the first time in the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Hou@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social apartment construction again .
this way to the gr@@ under@@ soil tax will be w@@ ai@@ ded and the land tax for subsidi@@ zed flats will be exposed to temporary property .
according to the Alliance , they are also necessary to achieve attractive am@@ or@@ tization .
the support programme for refugee sub@@ committees of the state bank Kf@@ W comes very well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was held on Monday night with 184 million euros more than half of the € 300 million available .
the project could be sh@@ oved even now .
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
according to Hungary , practically no longer gets through , there more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces announc@@ ing the transit of Slovenia into the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
the route is dangerous , however .
Croatia aims to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Home Secretary Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the devast@@ ation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get there from there to Western Europe .
500 people have arrived at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik &apos;s border , reported the Croatian television channel RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws , which came into effect on the same day , do virtually unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing to prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , kids and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , there are people who would not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning Croatian police arrested the first fu@@ g@@ iti@@ an refugees on the border of Serbia on the EU @-@ neighbouring country .
most recently , media reports were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and taxi in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t stum@@ ble on the border .
there are other haz@@ ards on this side : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance will now quickly create a safe passage .
the Hung@@ arians joined the border after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police arrested 366 people .
just before the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian Law@@ s stages the winter and damage of the border with us as a criminal off@@ ense .
in the South Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed there were therefore 35 criminal proceedings inst@@ ituted .
the def@@ endant reduced adhes@@ ion to five years and the deportation out of the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers met on Tuesday , with almost all - 93 of them - most import@@ antly - most important .
the applicant has 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees living there .
however , there is no one view , however , to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ring &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we started to clean up workers .
they gathered the litter , leaving the tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and one of the recording camp in the border area was rebuilt .
the goal of this building was to express itself extern@@ ally .
only a few refugees can reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has strengthened its border controls .
but around 20,000 migrants lost their country in the country .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people wait for the further drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on prescri@@ ption of German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees meet regularly .
Mayor made &quot; Gest@@ ational &quot; on the Border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were after the bridge &apos;s feast on Sunday with the premises , when suddenly there were ten people with traveling music at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Mayor Gary Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany surprisingly demanded the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday but for them in W@@ ern@@ em , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and the stran@@ ded along with two other hel@@ pers and whose cars ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red over the border into the near Pass@@ au .
previously we have only shortened the unexpected guests , with snack and beverages .
we were just right , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very than@@ k@@ ful .
a man did not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded towing on Sunday evening in Wels , held by a ICE train in Wels to Pass@@ au , where the railway traffic was stopped at short notice that the rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but not to try again .
but the Regional Court was placed in front of the W@@ ern@@ stein Border at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge Festival with the Bavarian neighbours have been soci@@ ably organized by the Bavarian neighbours - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of seem@@ ingly sacred politics :
rather than in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , on the erection of structures , our German Federal Chancellor intensi@@ fies and publicly re@@ marked by the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Nazi @-@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
sorry , this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans that are faced in the border regions with cha@@ otic conditions .
even the fle@@ eing state will have to state that the &quot; rented land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , in view of the persistent refugee centres and the near@@ ness of the coming winter , with us de@@ cent states for certain seek@@ ers .
and it will be an even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 win@@ try qu@@ arti@@ facts
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee under the refugee .
Christian Konrad , it &apos;s usual , that his word has its weight .
the government used an earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to en@@ act qu@@ arti@@ fic@@ es for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already received the chaos at the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we don &apos;t have no homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior said on the hand of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
there is a total of 8@@ 5.000 Qu@@ arti@@ facts in total in the hot year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 accommodation will have to be found in the next weeks - 20.000 people are allowed to provide .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without a floor , &quot; he said Konrad .
with the captains of the country , he has already led discussions .
they had backed these hands to him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it goes well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ates supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which shall be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations the asylum coordinates is also provided for the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ps like we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer private individuals un@@ complicated accommodations .
Moreover , one is hoping for hotels that leave blank in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in terms of emergency , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ei@@ er must have a certain amount of hand holder or size of the finishing .
for a fixed time , &quot; emergency pressure &quot; must be considered .
in contrast to the Interior Ministry of Health , Konrad was committed to establish Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who doesn &apos;t say un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able without another in the face .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er bear the Republic no cost as they declared themselves .
their number of employees will increase to three to four .
so far , the own qu@@ arti@@ stry search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
not a opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees , is planning the city of Linz .
this is currently not necessary since the people currently explo@@ red without these measures , mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says .
for the emergency , further sites have to be tested for their s@@ ut@@ ec@@ tivity .
critic@@ isms of the city of refugees in the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not slo@@ pped &quot;
in a longer switch@@ board with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the Governor Josef P@@ ehr@@ inger ( VP ) received the further advance in the refugee en@@ quiry on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has asser@@ ted me that the German borders are not to be destroyed .
to continue the journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
but now , there is the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not happen anymore .
the protective seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular journeys .
in other EU member states , P@@ ag@@ inger once again called for stronger solidarity in the refugee query .
that Austria also leads to its borders even on its borders , is a logical result &quot; from the incident of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; at Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the stock market IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased at young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine to invest in the start @-@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard , and later also to equi@@ p themselves .
s &amp; T already wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - where Nieder@@ haus@@ er says : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
in the new location , 1.7 million euros was invested by the Tech@@ center , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ centre , which is part of a third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been regarded as a Tech@@ centre for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ centre .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of rest in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it in@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ struc@@ tor opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old in@@ dwelling of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ Market @-@ Ark@@ ade . after all , she now has an increase in the form of a further business local .
in the Fur@@ la shop , opposite the business , in which it sells pockets , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of various manufacturers , now everything about ladies pur@@ se of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
large bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in service since yesterday .
the first was changed several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long ignored , whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision amongst others , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were from the idea of a private site to which only her bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only interested in Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots .
Bre@@ it of her fashion interest has gotten s Bre@@ it of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I &apos;m afraid of most , if something developed and I can show new trends with substantial prices .
why so some woman when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ental , may also answer the specialist person with the last safety .
perhaps it is about it to utili@@ ze a beautiful bag of any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from one place whose inhabitants are called an@@ vil .
this property connects with the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he comments alien@@ ously in foreign country , journalists don &apos;t address or decl@@ ines knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office r@@ ashes to campaign struggle .
and cuts out well .
this is registered also in the pe@@ eled K@@ all@@ stadt where grand@@ parents come from the real estate agent .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wine Road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants is about -@@ zig corners that is related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the campaign mode .
the healing of Simone L@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villages think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think you &apos;ll find that somehow , but they are not so pro@@ found@@ ly impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone L@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a native documentary filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous Spr@@ ings , to which Tr@@ ump also includes the Heinz ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for equality , comes to &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts , he did not put it there .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but tend to be the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a grand@@ mother , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dental attention was the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high @-@ condition : the gi@@ ants , says it .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the dealer .
the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated , and in the United States opened a local place for gold dig@@ gers .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the property sector were first plot runs in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of Tra@@ y : her wish to return to the home to the homeland , the Palat@@ inate was then belonged to the Bavarian state .
he did not accept Tr@@ ump , because he was once bred without permission , the Director of the Institute of P@@ hal@@ e History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film release .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ child of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally markers of the follow @-@ up .
he repeatedly rep@@ ented over Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a city wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ arity , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a removable Permanent Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a beg@@ otten Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was bor@@ n@@ ated Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the winter , retired , sees the Americans rather dist@@ illed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always about thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump should come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never been w@@ asted about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension is mentioned in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm , a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family on a visit to the church organ , which generally accepted well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that out of Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better if he didn &apos;t make the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such ra@@ dic@@ als views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had been in their grandfather in the United States would have been such as he would have been there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting threads than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ yed Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not it , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts from organis@@ ing the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson makes to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of driving force of the liber@@ als , but there is no major shifts in the reviews of Today .
the Breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m @-@ Bull introduced the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts of David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha ar@@ my@@ tage , was living in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls , and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play Australian TV spectators any role to play as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major capit@@ als , in comparison to the Today 33@@ 9,000 .
today &apos;s a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his figure remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Today has closed the gap in the last months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sun@@ rise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the last months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August , Today showed an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 h of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50.000 .
in September , Sun@@ rise has on an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are in order , thank you for checking !

the great emphasis for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Robert to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recently edited father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached an impressive size of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were asked if Thomson could bear a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven testified strongly with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and beat the blo@@ c ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe revealed to an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ate Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia is to be confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately succeed at 17 : 30 .

the last three match agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
un@@ bri@@ d@@ led mystery ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are probably not ignor@@ ant who wins the Bachelor .
the wife , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was finally immersed in greatest confi@@ denti@@ ality .
and none of the three left girls will certainly not give up , if it is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we went with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three two are checked , you probably have acci@@ dentally put a note on who will be the victory .
Sam Wood resi@@ sts his lips up to the final on Thursday .
all three women left in lyri@@ an way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If you &apos;re not who , who should get the last rose ? , &quot; who won &apos;t won their answers to match those who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood from the first day had to connect to another relationship .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and observed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I imag@@ ined that throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands at both feet on the earth , making it so much fun with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood used as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week reached its clear that Wood &quot; could be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and my family , it was clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I was set af@@ ire on him now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to whom Wood should choose if not they , she was av@@ our@@ sel@@ ing .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten in Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his moving into the U.S. - and there were many other teams sent after an impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ den for the rest of the game when he lost a rum@@ ble as it lost the Aussie Rug@@ by league conver@@ sions at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return , and also in the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula was still showing his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies , before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula confirmed Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ ad Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by custom e@@ ams coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey to take care of his pat@@ ron@@ ym and to worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched on a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first playing area of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it certainly was not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian mer@@ its for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not be able to introduce a worse start into his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that &apos;s coming together , just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ den made the sn@@ ails with his Origin , back then in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

now , asylum seek@@ ers want to push out the Free voters as quickly as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger requested more staff for administrative charges , which are responsible for asylum . &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .

4 people killed , after police officers shoot in Nepal on prot@@ esters
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after demonstr@@ ating rubber belts in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday said .
the violence broke out on the evening night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station where some of them threw stones and burnt bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have applied tear gas and then shot down into the air before transfer@@ ring to rubber fin .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why they used the rubber compound , from which it may be able to kill but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously a so high death rate produced .
the meditation was the last in weeks violent protests in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ mat@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce its political influence .

coverage by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful weight loss surgery helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ sized people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if light @-@ overweight people with diabetes after the loss of weight loss live longer than those who do not get surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study at J@@ ama Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ Surgery are using different methods to reduce the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has been used to treat type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out by humans that are disease @-@ ob@@ ese using a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people who have a BMI over 30 are considered in ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers used from Tai@@ w@@ an min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - Mag@@ enb@@ ypass and Mag@@ ical slaughter - for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who underwent surgery is from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI was among those who were non @-@ surgical treatments were equal to 29 .
among those who undergo surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was dissolved and 28 % partially dissolved .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was fully dissolved only in one percent and partly at only approximately two percent .
Moreover , the results were presented in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general , in general the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as opposed to improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , so the Chief researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team demonstrated average results in two types of surgery .
for the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas dosing group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher decl@@ ines in the BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and recorded more overall survival ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy humans in Sweden , that operation has led to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was diagnosed in ob@@ ese people who had subjected to obesity - about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group compared to conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery people said Black@@ stone , it is soo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because they say that this operation is lower in the lower BMI Group , &quot; excluding the risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have to wait too long until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have attached their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the true solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist guide asked to termin@@ ate violence in the homeland of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which is dedicated to Eth@@ ics .
he demanded that the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of the West European countries indicated on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama proposed an effort to support the crisis of Germany and Austria to support the crisis , he emphas@@ ized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to worry about several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and true development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about how the killing in their countries is decreased .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 and issued that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my side dish in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he put power , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; children are increasingly being more common to these products , and sad@@ ly a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; Lop@@ ez CNN says .
he said that some children are disinf@@ ect@@ ant to drink while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube showing how you@@ thful disinf@@ ect@@ ants will drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed marri@@ ages with alcohol @-@ alcohol mou@@ th@@ wash , in order to get a har@@ der drink .
younger children can be ste@@ amed from attractive v@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes , and orange shower , which are very attractive for children .
ham@@ mo@@ ck infection are somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for infants , few spl@@ ashes are able to lead to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medi@@ cally director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ebooks centre at the Hospital of Kansas , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would don &apos;t let drink whis@@ key , but humans leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come about it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume too much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl , who recently had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from following straw@@ berry du@@ ck @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought to treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold once had been dr@@ unken with an adult , Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said , a emergency doctor who was treated in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah caught her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors supervised the mind over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma when the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head back , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very sc@@ an@@ x@@ ious , &quot; said Or@@ al Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ Pass &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could be fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has both parents and teachers recommended to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ection chie@@ fs and disinf@@ ection disinf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after the swal@@ lowing of ham@@ mo@@ des@@ infection , which had a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
people of health authorities toler@@ ate that the product contained Me@@ thane , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was recorded as an active substance .
in January , three students of the fourth class were admitted to the State of New York to po@@ is@@ oned her &quot; teachers &apos; teachers , using anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; then there is a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to ham@@ mo@@ des@@ infection and spent her from their room .
the police were considering the failed blu@@ epr@@ int as &quot; D@@ w@@ ät@@ z &quot; and showed inter@@ disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles are damaged

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bo@@ red low@@ lands - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and previous national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the ranking .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the rank .
they speak of Old Fir@@ m .
they speak of both teams and that is what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I &apos;ll turn all things , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Cel@@ tic will have to fight , but the Norwegian boss decided to move things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the following exp@@ ulsion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ eil@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it - but we must go on .
we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes players better .
now it is important .
warm c@@ auti@@ ous in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago that he made a couple of January transfers , Rang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful in the signing of new arrivals and insi@@ sted that he does not want to inter@@ rupt the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the Summer Window . &quot;
the players who come in summer have this pres@@ eas@@ on time to integrate with what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Cel@@ tic objective t@@ ang@@ u with retreat of return
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Cel@@ tic during the transfer period in conversation , showed that he could withdraw back when his contract expi@@ res at Sw@@ ans .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , cups or le@@ agues that didn &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while being in the United Kingdom so far .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the Swiss unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the level of Ukrain from 5.5 percent , as shown by the statistics for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , the number of jobs in Scotland fell by 12,000 throughout the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.000 .
the unemployment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell commented on the new numbers and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation stone for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s nearly a year ago that Scotland has hit the historic decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I be witness to be an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening I will sit in an audience gallery in the Death Chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ a is executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was the best friend for the first time in January and when I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalty .
there would be a unique perspective .
it is true that repor@@ ters could see in the USA , and since often more applications are available as places , a huge lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
fir@@ stly , who is chosen will observe it in the engine .
I can &apos;t do that .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ a , I will sit with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of months with telephone conversations and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to aband@@ on my imp@@ unity .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained with you .
she dre@@ amt that they could have &quot; it better &quot; well , &quot; but it still th@@ inks that it is false what I do .
Richard Glos@@ so@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he tells me not what I have written to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to present an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with security , that Richard Glos@@ so@@ p is innocent .
his deeds after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ aries of the act .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough proof to justi@@ fy a death sentence .
I think his execution is false .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and from this perspective I will see him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not claim to be obj@@ ectively speaking .
there will be other repor@@ ter that you can apply for it .
what you will get from me is what it means , a man will die unnecessary .
man after mo@@ ist police raid talks to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Perth to stop the police was successful , when he found himself in the sh@@ allow and sum@@ p@@ tive water , just a few meters from a police officers attemp@@ ting to ski@@ p him to the shore . &quot;
the police in C@@ anning V@@ ale was launched on Tuesday for a drop @-@ down incident in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming up , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too thr@@ illed to make his uniform , therefore he turned to be a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Ser@@ ve Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , Cou@@ sins entered his car in the tr@@ ench to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River .

Peter Moody claims that ste@@ wards tried to draw him out and threatened to end race racing
Peter Moody claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria had tried to install a sp@@ y in its st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he w@@ led to the ste@@ wards and the Integration Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she brought a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race @-@ day treatment of the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
today , Fair@@ fax Media said that he had always attempted to do this , which is best for racing and himself found himself under difficult conditions than it went to explain the positive co@@ b@@ alt sample of li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had with@@ held 18 months due to sp@@ ying accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want to see it &quot; how to get high grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have taken care of it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated , that everything will come out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes it re@@ acts and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to do so what I said .
I will go home this evening and sleep well .
I want to climb the main walking , and I want to think that my owners I try to try my best .
when you start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moody &apos;s bomb explo@@ ded in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integral Unit had tried to leave his stud .
&quot; more than eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and gave him a job in my st@@ ables to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody to Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ er .
if that &apos;s the case , they should certainly contain her n@@ oses , because they have failed to summar@@ ise me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ y , president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , recent CEO of Route L , were aware of that of the time and are still today .
should I bring this to the view , that it is personally ?
does the Route L have cra@@ ven behaviour and perhaps takes people outside of the train@@ ers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the sector ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there I am there .
perhaps they have to take my license and put me a doubt , and I don &apos;t doubt that what I say you can think about it now .
but at that point I am at the point where the matter is , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will execute the pressure on them and press it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit @-@ cycle levels of the train@@ ers have constructed with the long @-@ co@@ b@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could not throw his license on the table . &quot;
Moody , best known for his preparation of the un@@ fortun@@ ate master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , announced the race @-@ tags rule &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound was applied to the horse &apos;s hor@@ s@@ eback , which had viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to take responsibility for it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has ir@@ radi@@ ated the mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been that night .
it could be yesterday all day so that what was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moody could con@@ gr@@ ate a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day . an inquiry into the affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one went to well , &quot; said Moody .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals in ring strug@@ gles against ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda &quot; from two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators are able to fight the &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high season finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a little covered note to the Storm team after his team had reached the Final victory against North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; para@@ dig@@ m &quot; of the Rug@@ by league and said that the two from Queens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends the neck of his team and said that she concentr@@ ates only on her &quot; contact &quot; during the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach in his team is confident that they are concerned that they are concerned , from the Storm team to be defeated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that dives again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring games she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focal point and this has been the trend for us .
Tr@@ ent is now for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is probably not able to lose it , so it was a bit of shock to him .
it &apos;s been strange as it dives again at the time of the season .
Bell@@ amy has been inspired the idea of the &quot; enth@@ r@@ ying soccer &quot; with his ment@@ or to remember that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ wings the Premier League won with &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; soccer league in 2010 .
Wayne made by exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a bor@@ ing team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a partition .
but now he has a team that can play and that we are acting as an exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play .
I build more confidence because they say these things , because they are a little concerned to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think of us when it went around the Big Games .
Bell@@ ini also pointed out that the game of the Storm against Roo@@ sters results in a higher result than the match of Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t watched it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game but is that exciting game ?
or are breaks do and have no points a bit ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me there are the rules .
if they mention to us , it means that we will hit the stage again in a phase .
the Storm team has freely won that weekend , since they won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday evening in the final in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with $ 200,000 deposit to Drug Invest@@ igation
a man , who may anticip@@ ate a lifetime penalty due to his experiment , in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were s@@ elled to Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men that were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he found his co @-@ accused in the J@@ ach@@ th@@ afen in the mid@@ day and later on the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to own a commercial lot of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the Café may have been a harm@@ less reason .
judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the escape danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared his judgment on Wednesday .
in case of the criminal case , he lied to the police on its where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars than security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the detailed explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Judge F@@ agan said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they alone will not be sufficient to stop him , and he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against damage , under the conditions that he claims his Australian to his Serb pass , on the police open a day , and keeps himself at a start @-@ stop at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to expos@@ e ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
a ped@@ oph@@ agus employed the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as this slept , log@@ ged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ wanted pictures of children who were sent to him from another user .
the girl aw@@ oke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she looked through it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ arms immediately her mother .
so the police stum@@ bled and saw the five pictures , analyzed the computer that were found under the address and discovered some sort of &quot; web research , the terms for the search of in@@ cess@@ ant pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then maintained with the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; a ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; he gave &quot; a polic@@ eman to make them afraid . &quot;
the Prosecutor &apos;s Office in E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson said the Dun@@ dee &apos;s Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a su@@ p that he ad@@ dic@@ tive to fri@@ gh@@ ty people .
he said that the sear@@ ches were performed on the computer , said that it was done as he claimed to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did so to temp@@ t it .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girls took the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and at the weeping .

J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human being un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court was given a former in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel former office in Te@@ gel , which was accommodated in a small cell in months .
because of injury of their human dignity , in@@ mates have been eligible for financial compensation when they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision decided on the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the person affected could not hope for money if they were imprisoned for few days in confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an explosion @-@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : it was integrated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel Palace group between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
afterwards the man , who , according to his address , was meanwhile installed on the free foot , moved to a larger cell .
his premier@@ ship in Germany was failed in violation of the outstanding detention conditions against the Land of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court found the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and referred the case there for a renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber court now decides about the amount of compensation
also , for legal reasons , only a few days of dis@@ claim@@ ers have been author@@ itative for the compensation , it was given an appeal to the same .
otherwise , &quot; a short@@ com@@ est of the right protection of personality is to fear . &quot;
the chamber should now seek the amount of money compensation .
the constitutional judge have already strengthened the rights of pen@@ alties in the past .
so they spoke only in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee of damage , because he was imprisoned in a cell nu@@ de .
human un@@ worthy is according to a 2011 decision , even the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel event in November 2009 , Karlsruhe confirmed a de@@ cent accommodation with a parall@@ el@@ age in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was over three months , daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ bad case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come to the head@@ lines in the last few weeks .
the det@@ ain@@ ees should therefore always arrive at 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ vity himself , it should be already come to s@@ lu@@ te themselves because of the cl@@ amped position .
after the alignment of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for offspring with offspring , 19 are supposed to move in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are able to do that &quot;
the migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany about ?
according to forecasts of the German Interior Minister this year , about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are expected to come to Germany according to the statement of Vice ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany , to record one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say back and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
according to various forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal State Department ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as you have built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all at affordable hi@@ ps : annual payments fall from 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 nation@@ alities from the rental period , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments to apply refugees .
Federal State Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this from the point of view of P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 resource rewards would have to arise and therefore would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per ann@@ um .
in the meantime , scientists and Federal Association declares that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in the housing .
according to estimates by the Institute of Employment Research and Professional Research , 55 percent of the fle@@ eing population in Germany can be employed .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically being asked to help them in their qualification , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , however , it is necessary to see whether they work in Germany .
labour is the key for social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation of the recording group , but also for the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of immigrants , says mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , a political shift was given to the throne in Germany : from the ban for refugees to recogn@@ ise work .
while so@@ oner for asylum seek@@ ers existed for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , the asylum seek@@ ers was reduced to three months in November 2014 , and the asylum seek@@ ers , which are asylum seek@@ ers .
in society - mainly because of the specialist in society , mainly aff@@ ecting the visibility that the refugees should be able to secure access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German .
so far there is no adequate supply of general and vocational @-@ related language courses .
investigations also show that employment are most widely convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
there is therefore a network of networks in view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Royal Path to work integration .
the Berlin School Military Administration has found that only few of her parents give her children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the roots of their parents it is only once important to famili@@ y the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ hr@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management are distributed in various languages .
if the demand for refugees intensi@@ fied by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase their training capacities by increasing more technical colle@@ ges .
students without German knowledge have to be prepared in welcome groups on classes .
but they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin School of school .
the German Student Union estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees in Germany wish to study .
in principle , no Federal Republic of asylum seek@@ ers or oration of the study - the only exception was Berlin , within the ens@@ er Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , but now abandoned its position .
study consent for refugees can be facilit@@ ated from the education institution .
because refugees with a stay or Dul@@ ce do not receive performances after the asylum seek@@ ers law , when they start studying .
in principle you will be no B@@ af@@ o@@ g , since it will not fall under the circle of the b@@ yp@@ assing persons .
Ged@@ em@@ ian refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years now , to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
these financing must also be closed , but will call Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for science , and the German Student Union .
the students should get up immediately b@@ af@@ o@@ g .
Islam will continue to play more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many are the religion important part of its identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely adopt the same rights as they have churches , and to further develop existing state churches law in a new state of religi@@ ons .
it would also be important also to establish an Islamic charity , which is profession@@ ally att@@ ened to the new@@ com@@ ers .
obligations to the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam must rely on clear persons and willing to work together with the state in many areas and to break some control possibilities .
this also belongs to the will@@ ing@@ ness to act to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism towards religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany as well .
those who wanted to off@@ end these conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately gave their right to hur@@ ry here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ ic .
integration will be much more today than today a topic of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society has to change , dis@@ degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
namely , Germany - as a result of European decisions - a decade of discrimination and a gender equality law since an ensu@@ ing decade .
but it is very slow at how the NSU race series showed , in the police and authorities systematically insp@@ ect the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and stakeh@@ older groups will be for long demand and to under@@ take international agreement as the anti @-@ ass@@ is@@ ion@@ con@@ servat@@ ories of Germany , in the coming years , when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the sole of all .
generally Germany is in force to medi@@ cally care for the expected refugees to have medical advice , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we do this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery is required to tap water all the doctors under the registration of health cards .
it was carried out later by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly frag@@ ile , so many people with the limited power catalog can see the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum .
otherwise , physicians will take to create the doctors above all .
so far , even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ gh proved to be worse than other patients in Berlin .
not only in medical clinics , while in medical practices the interpre@@ ter would have to be taken over , ur@@ ges for them .
many refugees have also been assisted in case of emergency medical care already in case of emergency medical care .
and with another diagnostic sight .
there are clearly more untreated disabilities under refugee camps , and in the young people it is going to be HIV @-@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with some other disease images , the German doctors of their apprentices@@ hi@@ ps are simple , however Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; paras@@ ite di@@ arr@@ he@@ a or tuber@@ culosis are not as hard to recogn@@ ise . &quot; and what if the medical relationship continues , be bl@@ ur@@ red in sight by the refugees .
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system ; some refugees don &apos;t have doctors .
in order to practice practic@@ ing , however , they must re@@ prove their qualification and do it once more tests .
according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees in Germany , most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic strain or depression .
especially orph@@ ans , refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study presented by the Technical University Munich showed that every fifth Syrian refugee children ensu@@ ed in Germany .
whoever is suffering from post@@ trau@@ matic strain disorder suffer@@ ers , among others , suffering so @-@ called Flash@@ back with short@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death cases .
other symptoms are ins@@ om@@ - and concentr@@ ating disorders , strong sho@@ el@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms should be chronic , a early treatment would be necessary ; Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ically ill refugees have a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers in the social re@@ tention can make a request for a psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
Moreover , in the social offices mostly affairs managers or doctors who are not trained for mental disorders , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst since more than 33 years .
so , the gift of the inspir@@ ational family is in the blood .
it is important to us to take away people from their everyday life and take it to a completely different world for two hours , under@@ lines the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Jun@@ e@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; Man@@ gement award with cos@@ mop@@ olitan @-@ fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
this fl@@ air will experience 50 cities in the nearly 3 000 km long tour .
the program of Circus convinces with talented artists from around the world .
in the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ thic C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm into their sp@@ ell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their handic@@ raft .
the Cub@@ an Duo want to capture the Cub@@ an Duo with the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ Films .

60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ ized Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ t in the position of cir@@ cus are only subject to the subject of different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst takes away also : &quot; if it &apos;s not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they are going to be lov@@ ingly called , is read on every request from the eyes .
we want to collabor@@ ate with animals and have fun with them .
does not feel well , I don &apos;t want it to the Man@@ ege .
the top command thus : good to ensure the animals .
the family Pro@@ bst particularly proud of its Zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a blend of a sh@@ land p@@ ony and a zeb@@ ra family .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a fence and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for all visitors .
&quot; one is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if there are five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ y@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers a false speech in the parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , down the platform in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall spread rapidly via the Social Media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also sc@@ anned by M@@ EPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with pro@@ clamation .
last month , she had booked him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese stated that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians SMS messages received messages on their phone numbers that they chose to inter@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ ve &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it war@@ ns the members of the members , that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament will end and once they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .

Hewlett @-@ Packard opens up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to generate between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs within the restructuring and savings efforts towards the company &apos;s services .
now this year , HP will split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and split the computer and printer @-@ owned by its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service operations .
the expected place of vac@@ ant proceeds to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure to the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ woman and Chief Executive Officer , said the unity after the separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and stronger , when HP is today , and we have a wide and sophisticated portfolio of shops that support companies while moving to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better prepared than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US Dollars per year and will be concentr@@ ating on the provision of an integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 1930s by the Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical installations and the Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the place of birth of Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC producer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely focused businesses can deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the latest Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and unless his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to be sure at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly not un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had severely terminated the last season after a separate ank@@ le viol@@ ate and then returned to his old fl@@ ung during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury not threat@@ ens the career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone , who was not good .
that is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
he was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from purely medical point of view but like W@@ enger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a pleasant patterns .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different ill@@ nesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ as@@ ies in the last five times .
the larger image for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 with most po@@ ison@@ ers of injuries .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ sky , but Arsenal believes that improvement in the physical rate will last continuously during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time to strengthen your body and win mar@@ tial arts , &quot; W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to overcome the .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will pass through a career of its kind , which he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is taking a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u de@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta can start to start .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ on Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to hold the balance , and the players who need it to get a little sn@@ ail drop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are passing through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadion in Zagreb is one of the slots with the biggest in@@ ference in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the last season has been started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was struck on Tuesday night by an earthquake which was measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved the doctrine from last season with the Champions League &apos;s surrender to Monaco and will continue to lead the help with his management assistant to his first European cup triumph .
&quot; this pro@@ pul@@ sion is immune , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Arsenal had never folded in ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m too long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ festi@@ vity : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for males to open oneself , now even more doubt than ever , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high proof .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ate ( CA@@ LM campaign against her@@ ed@@ itary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of man to question the culture in question that men seek to seek help seek them .
Friend@@ ship is the heart piece in the struggle to master this challenge .
a current study in more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms revealed that , when the l@@ apping had a suff@@ iciently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its chances are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental heal@@ ings keep the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media , communications , with its focus on the substance , the in@@ fertility of the answer is often more important than a meaning@@ ful contact .
our digital life have the need to make strong , cheer@@ ful and fun to appear , even though in reality the isolation is dominated .
this su@@ perf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , anything at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire stated recently , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focusing on the head was placed .
each character has not been defined by his work , but through his personality who sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents in their football matches in cozy s@@ lan@@ ders , and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even if they often keep back , completely to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as one employee of the telephone call , it declared to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hearing role for people who are de@@ pressed in de@@ press@@ ant and sel@@ f@@ ici@@ ally vulner@@ able to me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in the position to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I tried to offer long @-@ term clearance mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .

di Santa insp@@ ire to help PS@@ G to gr@@ ind , Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani to Malmö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to take part in Malmö .
here are the game figures and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani thought course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ land stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League &apos;s debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion to their way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased its lead when Cav@@ ani recorded a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A you need a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they stri@@ ve not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way towards the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ h@@ ov@@ ics missed chances before entering the gate . he became later in the game against his home town team and against the club , with whom he began his har@@ dening career back in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or even to the Champions League . thus , it &apos;s a good start to create 2 : 0 and look back , even if there are certain things we need to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good pre@@ mark .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry we didn &apos;t yet have one or two more goals . &quot;
superior him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold on weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided to hold his place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kick@@ ed out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ ms was taken as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Manchester , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö defense , before it pushed into a long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off went to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was excited by a five man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ pps in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had a little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself referred to itself sometimes , with some wr@@ inkl@@ es and bad inclu@@ sions , not least from Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was not least induced in the first half of experiment alone in the first half after the re@@ boot had started .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow player into the play , and there was a passport of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic to transform the Di Maria into a fil@@ ming , which was provided by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute .
the second gate finally fell after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth install@@ ment , after Ibra@@ h@@ ovic had put up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malmö in the game could come back , and only an outstanding intervention of wild animals from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , could stop the final result lower before replacement Player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi can stop a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later told that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
watch from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

previously they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tig@@ ers appeared on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins inserted a chance for the rise within a match between Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game slot .
for Detroit even though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F speech , which was more difficult to summar@@ ize over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make a fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager &quot; Brad Pr@@ ism .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon maintained its early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside ings , then once in the sixth and then ninth time in ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) beat out for 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three rings .
it was just his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I will have to go into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Nav@@ al on July 6 .
&quot; he has swallowed the bow well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good at the ( crash training ) , saw clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he put it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh floor , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double in the left position .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a colorful , and Simon brought his second b@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y .
Hard@@ y was over the wall , the only man when con@@ fron@@ ted with whom he faced , in front of the designer ro@@ ok@@ ie , Miguel S@@ ano , who was a Two @-@ Run three @-@ run sh@@ unting .
with a pair of jo@@ ists and the finish in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe at a Double Play .
it was the major league in the Major League leading 27th time in that season that couples struck a Double Play
after arriving at the end of the 9th marks an Insurance Run , there was a R@@ BI @-@ double against the lat@@ er of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed stand S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth wave .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the opening of the game by an even moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers had captured three rings in the first two inside against the case of the veter@@ ans of veter@@ ans who had been canc@@ eled against the game from the injuries list , after having missed more than a month because of a back shift .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I want , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt well while I bet and felt that I would have some quite good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after winning the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first hand , H@@ one gave Ian Kin@@ ley at Second B@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ley .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play the single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the R@@ unn@@ ern in the sc@@ oring position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third to get the threat .
the tig@@ ers came into the second , one one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single von Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great coup , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not sm@@ itten it especially well , but he has caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever sp@@ har@@ sh@@ ing@@ A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three hits at six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal San@@ chez was due to injury of the throw .
it was investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the Sán@@ chez in 2007 .
Sán@@ chez , from the middle of August on the case of injuries because of a shoulder distortion , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the physical list to start the T@@ wins .

first F@@ öhn@@ ons@@ lau@@ ght , then pronounced cold front
during the coming night in the valleys of the fjord of the f@@ ohn breaks through , as with Met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z , on Tuesday .
on wed@@ n@@ esday and during the night , the F@@ öhn struck partly with storm strength through the F@@ ir@@ cles .
after up@@ going on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold fron@@ tage , the strong rain forest , wind power and a temperature back@@ drop .
like Met@@ e@@ o@@ news in a message , Switzerland is presently located on the front of a large low @-@ temperature region over the British islands in a powerful southwest pour .
at the night@@ mar@@ ching up , in the night the f@@ ohn breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn describes the f@@ ohn to the f@@ ow@@ ling with ar@@ ches of 60 to 100 km / h and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can also pass through to the adjacent middle @-@ end and even on the mountains are even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on wed@@ n@@ esday , stor@@ my hair dryer for som@@ mer@@ ce temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees begins to stone moisture at the edge of the Alpine Route .
here the rain keeps going on until Thursday night .
in sum equal to the south of the Alps , some 100 liters of rain per square meter can be accounted for over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has already been a lot of heavy rain during the last days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn describes the air , in a row a cold front with vig@@ orous , sometimes swe@@ ating rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind passes sharp@@ ly to win@@ dy , and the temperatures go significantly upwards .
the following days present themselves in the north , at 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the weekend , it will be sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees .
Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been baptised in the park on Wednesday as far as nam@@ eless space in the park on the Opp@@ io rally on the name of the German reform .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right next to the Colos@@ se@@ um in the middle of the year .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the community of evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Protestant Lutheran congregation in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries than minority groups often only in secret societies .
with the square it is visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the town back then as a sin @-@ label .
his negative impressions would have encouraged him in his future battle against Rome in his later battle .
in 1993 , Luther had then initiated the division of the Dutch church with his theses against the laser trading .
hammer artist spent three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ stone is one of the main buildings painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost is writing the introduction and given Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that now appeared with magnificent paintings .
at the beginning was the spectac@@ le for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 moti@@ ves his personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and canvas was formulated .
its &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and visionary forms has the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - what is by no means consistently with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective topics , the quite ob@@ sc@@ ure can work .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked in his Bible project for about three years , where he has met a sub@@ jective digital selection from the many thematic areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles of course , which are dedicated to St@@ ations , Pl@@ ages , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he thus beha@@ ved spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt on the basis of painting with the particular Bible verses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bible verses and thus translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into current context &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original Bible Reports of Martin Luther and , each in a set of the artist , which is here formulated its personal thoughts to the particular situation .
the cost@@ ume band has gold let@@ tering .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old dou@@ gh@@ ed dou@@ gh@@ ter into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were finally fulfilled in all the clari@@ fier for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 was born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler of the Order .
&quot; since the up@@ bringing happened along with the reed stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt reminds of itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up and to do it again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ inst@@ ate art in fast life again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is min@@ ted today by Advert@@ ise , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is pressing in there .
artists have another pleasure and delight , things to show .
images always have anything hidden and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt want to leave the viewer in the pictures &quot; cap@@ turing , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; that is always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like he under@@ stands with his paintings . &quot;
I don &apos;t notice that the Bible has to be completely rec@@ ess , but also chosen for him important , mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no co @-@ operation on the eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was created a few images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler to Luther &apos;s publishing house this work is an invitation , &quot; its life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images for M@@ öh@@ ler speak for both the ( biblical ) language of love and also the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fl@@ yers - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , companies contrac@@ ting , pe@@ an@@ ery designed for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - still before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished .
di@@ vis@@ ing in politics and administration around pollution , especially in those residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway .
so hills sh@@ ielded up , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permission to enter in October was the first par@@ ent@@ aries of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bu@@ ck now in child and youth affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year something more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be realized without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the work in the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga marks a clear sign in the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the p@@ ushing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures his assistance in solidarity with the cont@@ ag@@ ious problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle , this is nothing of me , I have nothing to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested in each individual to get this topic in the cl@@ ut@@ ches , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang ren@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he will inten@@ sively discuss the refugees in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister for State , O@@ Cin@@ ğ@@ uz and Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will surely be a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could help and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must set the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Bundesliga , therefore , has expanded its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee @-@ alliance to grow four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; beyond the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained ren@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEFA European Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some states also support this program .
this weekend , the 36 pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ware set a clear sign when it will take place on the left tri@@ bun@@ ch logos instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) to support the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ sman Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama created everyone , nobody can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be football , no , we must use our blast , our influence and our possibilities to help many refugees who have already been so incredible to help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoff@@ en@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent figure of the League . &quot;
for the EM qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach discussed the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German soccer . &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies would have launched its own projects were great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have issued will be on football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association combined with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publ@@ ishers have already called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported ren@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Board loses an eye on an accident
at the end of July , the board of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye through a fall in the beginning of July .
at the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he fell to a water crystal , which he carried away in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bl@@ az@@ ed and was able to go out and dra@@ gged on the road - that has he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ is Pl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could never go after his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beginning of October we meet at the chair@@ woman of the weather in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is involved in the meeting and &quot; fully work . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will return to Germany in October and continue to perform the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I had all the time in regular engagement with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually comm@@ uted between Germany and the USA , but since summer it was no longer located in the German SAP centre in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a kind of personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; says that everyone can happen so . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to stay up again when you please . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus down against Kras@@ no@@ dar : woman f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus down their first group game in the Europe League .
the national player is also a table leader in the soccer league in the Du@@ eling with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t turn back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
if R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga Round of Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ E @-@ Coach has left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high stress of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el is unable to change his pedi@@ gre@@ e only in the R@@ eus position .
this way he announced an shift to the door@@ ke@@ over .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking up the square of regular art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained in an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teachers praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future is used in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left unt@@ ou@@ ched .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for@@ mid@@ fiel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premiere of Mit@@ eus holding the goal of the Bv@@ B in the European League , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ f for re@@ covering : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not so wrong &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rob@@ ot@@ au@@ tos : government wants to iter@@ ate a pioneering role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer by the will of the federal government .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy expert from the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which , among other things , investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA study of a new mobility era .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated driving , automated driving , increasing traffic reliability and make certain amount of boo@@ bs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic also with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that come together with representatives of industry at the IAA .
the strategy panel of the Ministry of Transport is emphas@@ ized by the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and an elevated resolution on digital radio stations .
a test track on highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to give the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional Dis@@ claim@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to verify legal framework conditions , and , where necessary , to adapt to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in such a way , Germany will also be able to raise the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , so far only the man looks as driver .
the automated driving takes over increasing driving the car , the driver will be more and more the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Economic Department of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , vehicles will be expected to expect public roads in public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around € 8.4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the trucks may carry more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said SPD transport movement S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability in case of accidents and safety of personal data by the driver must be clari@@ fied clearly .
yet the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on the AA road@@ survey carried out by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA test results is that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent are still likely to believe that 31 percent do not think of it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 are reck@@ oned by independent vehicles , 33 percent in the United States .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after an increase of the digital sales of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to vote in the entire drive on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , traffic could present at least 15 percent , while standing 45 percent .
good everyone would leave the control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight only in single from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision is to be concluded at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; you have experienced the guys in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get this title without Timo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hence the B@@ oll was at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed Spon@@ sor@@ um in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer a clear favourite , &quot; explained by the Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ch@@ char@@ ov .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo has also chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , and we have been European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate us , &quot; declared the space @-@ fifth of the world .
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has pulled down a serious injury on the right leg .

Gaul@@ tier feels to become old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a juni@@ per @-@ p@@ us@@ el@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , that look terri@@ bly , thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ nen out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - so that he put men in coats .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was bound , meanwhile , it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a happiness that the Mod@@ esch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed its original variation on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a bit after death , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you dies , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the previous work of the man , which has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the vision is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which was operated for much effort : in order to tap the pupp@@ ets , for instance , a styl@@ ist was hired .
14 tons of material used the makers according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
just before the start of the October was another special treat : a leather p@@ ants out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are pregnant as men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ t@@ &apos;s old Teddy is visible in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ itated modified vent@@ ures of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his t@@ ed@@ dy construction and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
with a doll to play , his parents could not allowed him .
the dis@@ card of fashion he was brought down himself later .
he &apos;s mild fashion magazine and looked to the designs of other designer , how Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought it , but of course I bought it .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ lin head as fashion @-@ niche
it used to make the long embroi@@ der@@ ers in and around Pl@@ ushes down to the meter .
these stu@@ ff@@ ed materials and tops were produced in large amount for customers working for example bl@@ ank@@ ets and curtains .
today the alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ren@@ zer Pl@@ ates .
instead the fashion is important .
in the beginning of Pl@@ au@@ lin &apos;s top fashion , fashion played a bigger roll , then p@@ ushes through the hom@@ o industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls several examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional trac@@ ts .
ever , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that ref@@ uses on past bul@@ ls , an increasing client potential .
those who have no commercial use in the textile industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they already account for half of all orders .
Mo@@ unting seats Pl@@ ates together with nine other companies member in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they must wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years around 80 percent of turnover have been leaving .
private shops and also the wholesale trade , there are almost no more .
our products are hard to reach customers on this road .
the mass product will be produced much cheaper in the Asian region today and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
Moreover , the export , currently moving to Russia and the USA .
so , there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tried to score as well as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the nit@@ ure in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have been a seal of quality , which shows that we produce eco @-@ ecology and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berg exterior of the Berlin University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region you need to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a power field between the refreshing ideas of designers and companies that must remember mainly economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a existing design is often only varied to hold a customer base .
a few years ago fashi@@ onable textiles designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter new the historic snow tip .
take the machine at some places small ch@@ icks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the la@@ zy gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ heart of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ry made inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start talking with traditional Pl@@ au@@ lin head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a elabor@@ ate method it shaped the pattern of silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ au@@ sterity - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , after Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors were living in pl@@ ushes and surrounding area and who want to remember a memory card .
this makes me see my jewelry as modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ lin .
Disney also plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

EU wants to double mercury limit value in space
the European Commission wants to double limits for mercury in large smoking fish and consumers make a much higher dose of nerve gifts .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an agreement report by the EU , critic@@ ised the plans seriously : &quot; risks and side effects of lack@@ ed industrial and environmental policy are decl@@ ining with full force of gay and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
in Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt , the limit values of the nerve flow for large fish at the end of the food chain such as Hai@@ - or S@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; should be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
big rap@@ es@@ fish exist already so strongly with mercury , that on the basis of the still relevant limit values about 50 per cent of the length should not be sold .
after the dou@@ bling of the limit values only 14.5 percent would be dis@@ able .
in return for this movement , the EU wants to drop the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , said this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller fish @-@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are as low as low , that they already hold the intended maximum values today .
therefore , the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant de@@ fl@@ ection man@@ oeu@@ vre , which helps only the economy &quot; says Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt .
mercury is a heavy @-@ type heavy metall , which is strongly sub@@ cut@@ ted over the food chain , particularly in smokers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government therefore warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only small amounts have especially been able to cause harm to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ dition of the Nerv@@ ous System &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares its homepage with regard to the limits but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ing the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not expect to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets mainly through coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total population produced in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish around Elbe , Rhine and Danube &#91; was &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Perman@@ ently crossed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited in the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the European War@@ nings regarding mercury in fish already reported to the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
