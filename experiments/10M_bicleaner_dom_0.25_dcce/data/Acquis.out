the B@@ IS may include standby credit agreements with central banks of the cred@@ itors in order when banks represent a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the amount paid by the cred@@ itors to the mechanism , and within a total amount of 2,@@ 7@@ 725 b@@ illing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all the future growth rate of the member countries .
however , some conditions now are called , to which the B@@ IS would be ready for use .
at each standby credit , the B@@ IS would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions to be exceeded , but without the fact that a total of five years is exceeded .
at the opening of the loans and their full extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a creative vision vision .

the draw would be made at the closing of the agreement with the agreement of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would be eligible for time periods taking into account the means of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who comply with the B@@ IS on similar conditions under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would correspond to largely the market rates .
if the B@@ IS necessary to proc@@ ure the necessary funds itself on the market , then the interest rate could reach a maximum which represents the corresponding margin increased by the Li@@ bor rate .

a reference to blood group determination must react to all tested blood samples which contain the anti@@ gen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g for the antibodies or any other on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the same way by the manufacturer , then the following factors or phenomena do not occur : a ) ha@@ em@@ ol@@ y@@ tic characteristics ;
the tit@@ er is measured by always a renewed re@@ lu@@ tion of the Re@@ ag@@ gregation , which was measured to double in a suitable medium .
the t@@ iter is the re@@ zi@@ pping value of the strongest ser@@ um@@ ulation , in which a reaction occurs ; the th@@ inner is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object shafts , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has fixed for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents to the blood group of international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are worked at the time standards .
an international standard pre@@ h@@ at contains according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in single preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents to the blood group determination of most speci@@ alities is expressed as a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational disease which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic floo@@ ding .
the tit@@ er gives the di@@ lu@@ tion of the re@@ ag@@ gregation in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents to blood group determination , for the International standard pre@@ ferences available ( e.g. Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International standard pre@@ fac@@ ulty ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents to the blood group of blood , we should not be colored , at least as long as not until an international Convention about a uniform system has come about .
reag@@ ents to the blood @-@ type determination are in such a manner and in such a amounts that this is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity used in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy process described in this protocol .
the manufacturing Laboratory has over all production levels and controls of reag@@ ents to form the written records of the written records .
adequate samples of all returned reag@@ ents are to be kept so long from laboratory agent until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents contained in the reag@@ ents of the reag@@ ents may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of re@@ ag@@ gregation .
for technical reasons these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective activity .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , with dried re@@ ins , the amount and composition of the liquid necessary ,
Moreover , this label , or label on the cardboard box , in which the individual containers are located , or which included the containers , added the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , with dried re@@ ins , the amount and composition of the liquid necessary ,
every show is entitled to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the system .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood selected by the group B which can be characterized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum , human red blood cells contain the A @-@ anti@@ gen , i.e. those of group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human red blood cells containing no A anti@@ gen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the again sol@@ dered , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ ference of the anti @-@ A blood group of blood or a corresponding comparison would be split by A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml in no case .
when an anti @-@ A serum is mixed with an same amount of a 5- to 10@@ percent shiel@@ ding from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination is supposed to be dissolved in any time when the same attempt was dissolved with the anti @-@ A blood group of blood or a standard of equal Avi@@ ra .
anti @-@ B Serum can be obtained from the blood selected by the group A which can be characterized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
anti @-@ B Serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells containing B @-@ anti@@ gen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells containing no B @-@ anti@@ gen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the again dissolved but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ fac@@ ulty of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group@@ ums or an appropriate comparison would be to tit@@ el@@ ding B blood cells .
when anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a same amount of a 5- to 10@@ percent shiel@@ ding of B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , but the same attempt to re@@ boot the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group@@ ums or with a standard of equal Avi@@ ra .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is extracted from the blood selected by the group of 0 that can be identified by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , including sub@@ types A and A2 group AB , including sub@@ groups A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B , there are no human red blood cells containing no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of group 0 .
it combines human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) anti@@ gen ( which are not influenced by anti @-@ A serum of blood don@@ ors in group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard pre@@ part of the anti @-@ A blood group of blood or equal comparison , separately against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is dissolved in parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ fac@@ ulty of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group@@ ums or an appropriate comparison team against a cle@@ aring of B blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml in no case .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also eman@@ ate an easily recogni@@ z@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with same amounts of 5 to 10 percent over@@ flowing between A1 and A2 blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be dissolved after the same time , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ ferences of the anti @-@ A blood group .
if the anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with a same amount of 5- to 10@@ percent shiel@@ ding of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be dissolved within the double time , but the same attempt at an anti @-@ B blood group of blood or a standard of equal Avi@@ ra is carried out .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with an object carrier with the same amount of a 5- to 10@@ percent shiel@@ ding of A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera any specific@@ ity can be one of two types , which is distinguished by the prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , among which an ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others who are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ id such as about bar@@ der@@ alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following requirements on the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard pre@@ ference are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons that are immune through the anti@@ gen D of the R@@ h system .
it acts with human red blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen D , but not contained with human red blood cells that do not contain the anti@@ gen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a t@@ iter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the again dissolved but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ rh@@ o ) Ser@@ um or a corresponding comparison transmission compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which contain the anti@@ gen D , the serum should contain the possibility of blood cells , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen , react .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object shafts according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ per cent ag@@ ger@@ ation of C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in about 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more persons that are immune through the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it acts with over@@ flooded human blood cells that contain the anti@@ gen C , but not contained with human red blood cells that do not contain the C anti@@ gen .
this ser@@ ene is therefore only specific to the C anti@@ gen only if the tested blood cells are w@@ aged in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .

anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a t@@ iter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a who are intended to use object shafts according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form of anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed with an equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ per cent of ag@@ ger@@ ation from C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells within 30 seconds , a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within a period of 120 seconds .
sera the speci@@ alty anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ alty anti @-@ D + e can be won directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or Anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective among the specified response conditions at the same time .
is a serum to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the Ag@@ ility time is intended for all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not inferior to be lower than with the an@@ gering anti@@ body .
