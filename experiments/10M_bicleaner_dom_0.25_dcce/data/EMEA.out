this document is a summary of the European public transportation report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be explained as the committee for human health agent ( CH@@ MP ) in order to be implemented in order to supply recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the check @-@ in ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendation of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve itself in the mouth ) , as a solution for inclusion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . host thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar disease , a psych@@ ic illness , in which the patient man@@ ic episodes ( periods of oral mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe physical episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine .
the injection solution is applied for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral dosage of the medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution for inclusion or the melting of tablets can be applied in patients with the hat@@ ches of tablets trouble .
in patients who are using other medicines that are equal to the c@@ ili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted to ab@@ ili@@ fy .
this imp@@ aired the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of neur@@ ons each other .
Ari@@ ad@@ mir@@ zo@@ l presumably works primarily as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin plays a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and it will be prevented .
the effectiveness of Ab@@ ili@@ fy , the re @-@ act of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases which compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Ab@@ ili@@ fy was conducted over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of Ab@@ ili@@ fy and placebo , to avoid re@@ acts , to 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with ab@@ ili@@ fy .
the efficacy of ab@@ ili@@ fy injection solution was observed in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which compared to ger@@ min@@ ted un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psychological ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale of bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment were investigated .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tray and the solution for dispos@@ s@@ ling ( recei@@ veth ) .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients showed that the c@@ ili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms that received a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Ab@@ ili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms was more effective than placebo .
Ab@@ ili@@ fy also prevented the revival of man@@ ic episodes for up to 74 weeks in pre @-@ treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
ab@@ ili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more efficient than placebo increased accidents and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Ab@@ ili@@ fy for inclusion ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled ) , temp@@ oral secre@@ tion ( increased ali@@ br@@ is ) , ti@@ chel@@ ating hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ ce production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ rained blood , in@@ som@@ bre ( sleep disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
finally , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of ab@@ ili@@ fy in treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to serious man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l spoke , compared with the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the result that the advantages of inj@@ ections in rapid control of severe accidents and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with man@@ polar episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a licence for placing on the market of Ab@@ ili@@ fy in the whole European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of heavy until serious man@@ tic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day during a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
a increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patient groups a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of addi@@ ctive behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ection disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of cancer by Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , over@@ sight disorders , conditions that are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , h@@ yp@@ t@@ ins , treatment with blood pressure tum@@ ors ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ie ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ es Sil@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l auf@@ en@@ berger .
if patients were treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ mis should occur , should be drag@@ ged to reduce the dose or break treatment .
if a patient who develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , are to be set .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ ons in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or for states that are related with cr@@ amp@@ ings in connection with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l in patients with p@@ sy@@ ring@@ es associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l were treated , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dos@@ ages and the announ@@ cing for un@@ wanted events with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases also extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or death , was reported in patients that were treated with at@@ yp@@ ic anti@@ psych@@ otic drug , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ic anti@@ psych@@ otic drug patients treated to direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and spon@@ ges are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enen patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , which is known as anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in which weight gain as a side effect , and might cause severe comp@@ lications , and might lead to serious comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system is careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medicines such as Se@@ dation is taken ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remains unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ in and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects , and therefore similar to similar dos@@ ages .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ s. the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l resulting in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you consider the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential use of potential risks in patients should prevail .
other highly efficient inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ tions should be made .
according to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dos@@ ing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ abe@@ tic or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a stable increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be given to alert their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
because of insufficient data base on the safety of people and due to the in@@ productive studies during the animal studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines including strength vehicles , including strength vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequencies listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ eine and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ ced in therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was in patients with arith@@ me@@ tic treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with arith@@ me@@ tic treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic syndrome , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ nasty events and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or un@@ deliber@@ ate over@@ dose associated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence .
in fact , no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose associated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ; it is however un@@ likely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of use is , since Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma arrangement .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption about the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ m@@ eric recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 receptor and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ ing dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ n , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ as and on the put@@ ties .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 consecutive patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 out of the response of response to study diseases was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values of measuring values , which were defined as secondary data purposes , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l Group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ced in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in the primary study of weight loss , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ tic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I error , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l showed an effect on placebo improved in reducing the symptoms of 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ tic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ ad@@ mir@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effect on placebo .
in two plac@@ eb@@ o- and active @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ tic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed an effect on placebo improved in week 3 and a maintenance effect which was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ zo@@ l also proved a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic remission of the Man@@ ie on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that partially reflect on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy in some cases , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing the symptoms in comparison to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 . in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ time expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a remission during a stabil@@ isation phase in front of Rand@@ om@@ ization in comparison to the prevention of a bi@@ polar returns , mainly during the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ie .

the mean eli@@ oration time of approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is located at approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l , with an intensive met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ s. on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in an pharmac@@ ok@@ ical examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific analysis for Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to ethnic origin or the impact of space on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ical characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure , compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study with volunteers with different tren@@ ching of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to pull battles on their metab@@ olic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in re@@ treated gift , re@@ productive ox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to can@@ v@@ ative potential , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects covered a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent secondary tox@@ icity and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) with rats at least 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the average maximum dose when people ) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the average maximum dose when people at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of eradi@@ cation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ all of monkeys after repet@@ itive administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- until 3@@ fold the middle class dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose when people is based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the concentrations at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found at the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l no more than 6 % of the concentrations that have been detected in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys in the study ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .

the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
for prevention of recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who already received Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , then the therapy with the same dose may be continued .

hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases also extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ one or death , was reported in patients that were treated with at@@ yp@@ ic anti@@ psych@@ otic drug , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ic anti@@ psych@@ otic drug patients treated to direct compar@@ isons .

in an O@@ lan@@ ced in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in the primary study of weight loss , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ tic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ ad@@ mir@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .

in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold in the middle class of j@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for quick control of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be completed and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , injection is recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given ( see section 4.5 ) depending on the individual clinical status ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further major treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the medication with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tray or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
no investigations on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces are caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ al therapy with gasoline engines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be deemed necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedi@@ ment or blood pressure . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or medication ( by dis@@ ma@@ yed or illegal medicine ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , over@@ sight disorders , conditions that are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , h@@ yp@@ t@@ ins , treatment with blood pressure tum@@ ors ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ie ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ nia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ar@@ zo@@ l auf@@ en@@ berger .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and indication autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and spon@@ ges are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enen patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is observed and might lead to serious comp@@ lications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was higher compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as a single @-@ ap@@ hi@@ bit in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly known as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; Po@@ or &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ier@@ s can result in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma deriv@@ atives of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 into higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l .
other highly efficient inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages .
according to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dos@@ ing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was higher compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequencies listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral arith@@ me@@ z@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study about 12 weeks was the incidence of 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zol@@ - Treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under Lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with arith@@ me@@ tic treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , there was no medi@@ cally significant differences .
the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic syndrome , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , late dy@@ nasty events and increased mortality in older de@@ men@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the arith@@ me@@ tic injection solution with statistically significant significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ ors compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , the arith@@ me@@ tic injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in relation to placebo and similar behaviour in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed medium improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ itation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the population , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ z could be detected due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 228 consecutive patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the response of response to study diseases was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % .
current values of measuring values , which were defined as secondary data purposes , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ o ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ced in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in the primary study rates of weight , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ tic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to Mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study by man@@ ic patients who achieved a remission during a stabil@@ isation phase in front of Rand@@ om@@ ization in comparison to the prevention of a bi@@ polar returns , mainly during the prevention of a return in the Man@@ ie .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ation injection , the AU@@ C is greater than the AU@@ C according to the gift of the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two formulation .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time to reach the maximum plasma effect in 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection was toler@@ ated by rats and apes well and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target body after repet@@ itive gift in a systematic exposition ( AU@@ C ) , which were in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum humane exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies to re@@ productive @-@ st@@ icity to intraven@@ ous application , no safety signs relevant concerns after matern@@ al exposure that was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) of the maximum humane exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for security vulner@@ ability , tox@@ icity in recur@@ rent gift , re@@ productive ox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to can@@ v@@ ative potential , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; this means that they only limited or no meaning for clinical use .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study at the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously obtained a anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift and as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug containing a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
all in all , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treated medicines .
viewed only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines and survival compared to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane worked as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
it may not be used in patients who are silent or before the start of the treatment low neut@@ rop@@ ic numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the treatment was not more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el disease , and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines are not to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission announced the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the placing on the market of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ m@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( Neut@@ ral phil@@ ately &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ ropath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory Neu@@ ropath@@ y Level 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement of degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and with all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate satisfaction of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with inter@@ ven@@ ed kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to im@@ use@@ fulness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ art@@ ax@@ el of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have considerably more pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other forms of formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
when an allergic reaction , the medicine should immediately reset and introduced a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient can not be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated and the neut@@ ron number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ al has risen again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( Bil@@ ir@@ ub@@ in &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while it is not detected in connection with abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with the car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ cases were un@@ usually unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or the underlying cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant or women in the anno@@ ying age , which are not effective receivers , except the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ adequate .
women in the baked age should be applied during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable refin@@ ement method .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after the treatment does not bear a child .
male patients should be advised to consult the treatment of a sperm account since treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fert@@ ility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ re@@ dness ( very frequently ) and sw@@ ing@@ le ( often ) that can work on traffic conditions and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ym@@ car@@ cin@@ oma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical Phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable vital tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quick reversible and dos@@ ing ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ va in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as Mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

guarantee 1 The frequency of the transition effects is calculated based on a defin@@ iti@@ vely in the case of a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no significant connection with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ated active ingre@@ dient that supports the coupling of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ ber@@ indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli through in@@ hibition of its de@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
this stab@@ ilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ zy@@ t@@ ose is conve@@ yed into the end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ ums promotes the transportation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial transport is conve@@ yed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ or , and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( and ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for m@@ ating Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ air @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic m@@ am@@ o@@ car@@ cin@@ oma treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic m@@ am@@ o@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic Mam@@ m@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ resistant P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 hour in@@ fusion with the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
at the recording in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ ot@@ ous general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 Met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ amps .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general contact rate and time until the progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy at a periodi@@ c re @-@ ropath@@ y grade 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ als of neu@@ ropath@@ y on b@@ sound to bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 minutes in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the active section ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to an intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration increased to multi@@ ph@@ atic way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ cular distribution and / or soft@@ ness connection of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ical characteristics of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared with an 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ resistant P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ resistant P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue @-@ coated , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily reported to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic m@@ am@@ o@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the total annual dose generated with less than 1 % of Met@@ abol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which has a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to an organic pharmac@@ ist , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference ten@@ ant &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels that could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion comp@@ lications , if a blood circulation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , having experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to in@@ ject to a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or co@@ aches of care , provided that they have an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy alone , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per month for adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be used before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and an iron supplement should be administered during the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy alone or in patients with kidney problems , a anom@@ al@@ mic may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or that the body does not suff@@ er@@ ase the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was used as a injection in a v@@ ein within the framework of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered caused by kidney problems compared to reference ten@@ ant .
all in this study patients had been injected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were transferred either to Ab@@ se@@ amed or to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
Moreover , the Company also presented the results of a study in which the effects were examined by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were deported to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continue to continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , irrit@@ ating @-@ like heada@@ che and lac@@ t@@ ness .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , because further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
finally , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug has been achieved in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , dedicated to Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on medical specialists in all the Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medicines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a licence for placing on the market of ab@@ stre@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of em@@ ulation and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ors , mal@@ ign@@ ant l@@ ym@@ ph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m M@@ yel@@ oma who received chemotherapy and with which the risk of a trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anom@@ al@@ ies ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron defic@@ ien@@ cies are not available or insufficient , in case of planned major operating income ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for a reduction in foreign bl@@ ut , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron defic@@ ien@@ cies where a high risk of trans@@ fusion comp@@ lications is expected to be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot be part of an aut@@ ologist blood don@@ or program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
attacks and fol@@ lic@@ tions can be different depending on the age , gender and total disease last ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical course and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
an increase in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed in a patient individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration concentration .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the lasting hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
the patient should be monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for checks of an@@ emia and the anus @-@ ymp@@ t@@ ome .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher maintenance doses as a patient where the initial anom@@ al@@ ies is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher maintenance doses as a patient where the initial anom@@ al@@ ies is less heavy ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .

An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome and - following releases can be different depending on the age , gender and total disease last ; therefore the assessment of individual clinical course and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the patient should be monitored in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the par@@ ab@@ o@@ ct@@ t@@ ome .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ ine number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value , the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ ine number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has risen from the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value to ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ cul@@ ine number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , the dose should be retained three times a week .
in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ fier numbers increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the output value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa therapy is un@@ likely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with light an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ reaching deposit of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conden@@ ses should be charged twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operating procedure .
with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program - we will be able to stand large iron reserves before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 g / kg ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery ( Day 0 ) .
this should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ operative 300 / kg at a period of 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery , and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients receiving treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in at a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ last@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not get ill or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ rob@@ last@@ open@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , inst@@ ant@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ il@@ ro@@ mb@@ s ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ stically @-@ known ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are intended to participate in an autonomous blood don@@ or program , the application of ep@@ ti@@ ary disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial disease , vas@@ cular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cervical disease ; in patients with recently restored heart attack or cervical event .
ery@@ thro@@ rob@@ last@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body PR@@ CA after months of long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in .
in patients with sudden effect , the reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , should be determined with high demand for failure ( ice , fol@@ acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ or@@ ol@@ y@@ sis ) .
if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ds value is normal ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ id &quot; Index &quot; ) , which is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / Mik@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ cy@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marks for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should appear .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in patients with a risk of anti @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al anom@@ al@@ ies ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic kidney failure , the threshold limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular disease were observed if ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis stim@@ ulating substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefits that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration of an@@ thro@@ mit@@ es and avoi@@ ding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically in@@ suffici@@ ency or dust @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded , in maintenance therapy , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .
according to this knowledge , the treatment of anom@@ al@@ ies with ep@@ ages in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ ased in di@@ aly@@ tic in@@ suffici@@ ency , do not accelerate the progression of kidney failure .
with tumour patients receiving chemotherapy patients , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in response should be taken into account ( patients who may not be trans@@ coded ) .
if the h@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize adverse events in accordance with Section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic agent - dose for 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under participation in the respective patients , which should also consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger electri@@ fied orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , at the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ y @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia was investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger electri@@ fied orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , because they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with an initial cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded that for treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting dose of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled studies , ep@@ et@@ ine was not proven for ep@@ ox@@ ins , to improve the overall survival of tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic anom@@ al@@ ies .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received chemotherapy was led , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted
if ep@@ ic@@ in al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , blood cholesterol level should be monitored by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ k should be adjusted to increasing hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit .
in @-@ vitro studies of tumor tissues , there are no indications in the interaction between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F for ug@@ at@@ ological differentiation or pro@@ lifer@@ ation .

the most common adverse effect during treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is a dos@@ ing dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ie .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ ovascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

survival and tumor sites were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind plac@@ ebo@@ arding studies and
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients and the control patient .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients with a anom@@ al@@ ies due to various more frequent Mal@@ ign@@ ome con@@ sist@@ ent an un@@ clari@@ fier , statistically significantly higher mortality than in controls .
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ s and associated comp@@ lications when patients with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in treated patients and controls are satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine , and negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant@@ ine ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transfer@@ ring a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in of 13 g / dl , as many patients were included with these characteristics .
ep@@ o@@ in @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ time of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved by intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the final gift .
( bone mark@@ fi@@ bro@@ sis is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to a secondary hypertension or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were treated three years with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mark@@ fi@@ bro@@ sis compared to the control group was treated with di@@ aly@@ sis patients , which were not increased with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of fra@@ c@@ tures ( bones breaks ) , including patients who recently suffered a lower trau@@ matic stro@@ kes ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to take at least 500 m@@ g. of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with stro@@ kes should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflamm@@ ation ) short after application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , the symptoms can reduce symptoms , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che .
for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingre@@ dient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material used for Z@@ omet@@ a to review by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and it was investigated the number of vert@@ eb@@ le and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over 50 years , which had been suffered recently a stro@@ kes ; it was investigated the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was , whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds a bone substance ) decreased in the blood again or at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of cycl@@ or@@ tions in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding any oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ ente ) over a period of three years compared to patients under Placebo 70 % .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ c ) , the risk of mit@@ igation fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are often less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion center and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta is providing re@@ con@@ n@@ aissance material for the treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis which contains evidence of how the medicine is applicable , as well as similar material for patients who should be explained to the medical side effects of the drug when they should apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for placing on the market of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the whole European Union .

treatment of oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis • In case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • for men with increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hips .
to treat the post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis and oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended in two or more weeks after the operational supply of the stro@@ kes ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta was observed in patients who have observed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly recommended in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. orange or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first acet@@ ylene in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended , since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data for dis@@ use@@ fulness and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient @-@ population only limited clinical experience .
an existing hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia is treated prior to the onset of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the fast setting of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure a temporary hypo@@ thesis can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly recommended in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should become a dental examination with appropriate pre@@ emp@@ tive dental treatment before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who require dental gri@@ ps , no data are available , if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw range .
the clinical evaluation by the doctor should be based on the treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days of Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total samples of anticip@@ ation was comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ i@@ rable drugs effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney failure of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney disorders ( i.e. , an increase in serum cancer ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with placebo compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory devices , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , when compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the killing @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients were supple@@ ment@@ ing sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after one stro@@ kes and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical trials , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely tested , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as tubes , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the Kiev area of Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally , above all in cancer patients , above oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( pri@@ m@@ r in the jaw area ) reports that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ei@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections , including oste@@ opath@@ ic infections , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients according to dental tra@@ ctions or other dental .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients occurred oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area with an Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients treated with placebo .
in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ emia , can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was reduced to either a bone density or a BM@@ D score for the Sch@@ enk@@ ir@@ k ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without a sign of an existing sp@@ ine body .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ or@@ tions Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ bies ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
effects on Hü@@ ft@@ fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta referred to a constant effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density on the Len@@ k wir@@ t acid , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared with placebo @-@ treatment significantly for all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar sp@@ inal column by 6.7 % , the whole body rose by 6.0 % , the gross margin by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ op@@ or@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of oste@@ bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to placebo increased the tra@@ ctive bone volume and the receipt of the tra@@ ctive bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( BS@@ AP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) serum and the beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in periodi@@ c intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced BS@@ AP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP has been reduced significantly by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group treated with a group of 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D in total and sc@@ ary pre@@ h@@ ings at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total assets and 4.3 % at the shaft .
clinical efficacy in males in the Horizon R@@ FT study were 508 men random@@ ized , and 185 patients were evaluated for the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical trials amounted to 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study on men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was in relation to the percentage change in Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at related to the percentage change in the Len@@ den@@ wir@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , especially active until moder@@ ately heavy kill@@ ings ( medium serum mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ x @-@ specific upper normal value at inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proved in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
with the combined results , a similar decline in pain intensity and pain intensity was observed after 6 months in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ fication at the end of the six month study ( based on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up period .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach of 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients will be maintained during a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes long in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ at@@ tics that proved themselves as dos@@ ing independently .
then the plasma torch rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentrations , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ atic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ to 0,@@ 24 and t ½ years 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal recur@@ rent phase t / ½ of 146 hours .
the early phases of phases ( α and the left , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and differentiation of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the applied dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ym concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentrate against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance from cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzy@@ mes is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid does not metab@@ olic for humans and because they are not a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metab@@ olic dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min requires no dos@@ ing adaptation of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
because there are only restricted data for severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , there are no statements for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ treated intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg of body weight .

Sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose containing the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Office for Human Rights ( EP@@ AR ) , which will discuss the studies of human subjects ( CH@@ MP ) in order to supply recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( in particular overweight patients ) can not be displayed , where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medication ) can be applied .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ate resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sulph@@ ate resin or insulin may be maintained , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the sulph@@ ate resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin may be better util@@ ised and the blood sugar level reduces , so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ plex therapy was examined ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ate resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to reduce blood glucose levels when applying the dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ plex study , the effect of an additional charge of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ate resin in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients , the patients who participated in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.14 % in patients who participated in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( path@@ o@@ ys ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may possibly be very sensitive to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other elements , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ it@@ ti@@ zer ( high casserole , acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not indicated in case of met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited issued an approval for placing on account of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient in in@@ adequate and in which met@@ form@@ ations is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
to use Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are due to the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
the patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and oil if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come Study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase of reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure showed , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with enhanced output liver values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
when AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver values are as soon as possible .
if a patient symptoms developed that point to an ec@@ tical er@@ ectile dysfunction , such as imp@@ ass@@ ump@@ y nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ to@@ el@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver values to be checked .
the decision whether treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the launch of the laboratory parameters should be led by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be absorbed by fat deposits and in some cases linked to the fluid .
as a result of a Hä@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a slight reduction in central hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins about 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and at a lower extent also in patients under sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ len@@ ica and insulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is regarded as oral and triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ate resin or as a dual @-@ technical combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
after the launch of the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the consumption of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a ; however , physicians will be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients are dis@@ rup@@ tions of visual acuity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic statement should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events for bone qu@@ arri@@ es from randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients who compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative treatment .
the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient asks for a pregnancy or this entry , the treatment is ab@@ orted ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medication which are metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium she@@ er and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ z ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the insulin @-@ resistant insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thereby reduces the availability of the metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the lens and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens that can be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drug .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents occurred over the three times the upper limit of the norm@@ ality as often as placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced ma@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease the frequency of a heavy heart failure was diagnosed with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch has been rarely reported on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it was compiled a summar@@ ized analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ xed , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative treatment groups .
in the period over a period of 3.5 years , fra@@ c@@ tures occurred in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative treatment .
with taking a maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work on an activation of specific core rec@@ ep@@ tic acid ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ 130 ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal mus@@ cular cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been in@@ adequate , despite three months of optim@@ isation , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue only insulin ; a reduction in insulin was observed with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one group .
clinical trials above a year showed a statistically significant decrease in Alb@@ ums in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ fers in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus Pla@@ z@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , fixed examination of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics at 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials comparing to placebo a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as mar@@ gin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plasma gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels below Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ eri@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de levels , this both about a effect on the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well as on the vast Tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ active Study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease were randomised to either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after or@@ ally use , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , with the top con@@ cre@@ ations of un@@ changing Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma , usually 2 hours after application .
this base corresponds to the contribution of M @-@ IV for efficacy in about the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

according to a general use of radio@@ active mark@@ edly Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the lower ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changeable Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the total active Met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced ren@@ al function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance is similar .
in toxic studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agree with a repet@@ itive administration of Plas@@ ma@@ volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ hil@@ ic heart hyper@@ trop@@ ics .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thereby reduces the availability of the metab@@ olic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , inhibit@@ ing of hyper@@ pl@@ ums ( with male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( with male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epi@@ thel@@ ium were induced .

the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures for 100 patient years with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one patients who compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative treatment .
in another study on two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ d were examined .
clinical trials above 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Alb@@ ums in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ fers in comparison to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , but also improved the postoperative tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de levels , this both about a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well as on the he@@ y@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption as well .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin .
in the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ col ) hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , pointing out that the blood sugar levels were similar to the same as with other human beings .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) on human RPE cells or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can result in blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane at the treatment of diabetes compared to risks compared to the risk of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing on the market of action of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect together with a longer lasting effects will be desired .
the injection mol@@ ds must be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was injected .
patients whose blood glucose adjustment has significantly improved , for example , in particular , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic warning message can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any changes as regards strength , mark ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast vert@@ eb@@ rates , non @-@ insulin or insulin delivery ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin of animal origin ) can result in that a change of dosage is required .
if using Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient an dos@@ ing adaptation is required , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients where hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions came up after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin .
prior to travel that go over several time zones , the patient should be noted to obtain the advice of his physician , as such travels have to be applied , that insulin and meals must be applied to other times .
the doctor must therefore take account of any inter@@ actions in therapy and should always ask for other medicines prescribed by them .
4 . both mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia that can occur with a non @-@ controlled di@@ abe@@ tic therapy , increases the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fert@@ ility in uter@@ o .
severe mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid can lead to consciousness and / or cr@@ amp@@ ons and pass by temporary or permanent dis@@ rup@@ tions of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally - peripheral neu@@ ropath@@ y A rapid improvement of blood sugar may be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful re@@ ropath@@ y and usually reversible .

a mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic can develop gradually : • Easy @-@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acid can be treated by the oral care of glucose or glucose foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have glucose pieces , swe@@ ets , cookies or past@@ oral fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1,0 mg ) with in@@ treated aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously through the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum occurs within 2 to 8 hours and the entire active duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in it , that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of columns ( Hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ se@@ - ) places on the human molecule @-@ molecule were moved to aqu@@ eous humor ; none of the met@@ abol@@ ite formed is active .

it is recommended to increase the temperature from the fridge at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) - after the use of the insulin delivery room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is used in accordance with the instructions for the first use .
some patients where hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions came up after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can result in the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for placing on the market of action of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be applied , then the amount of the long acting insulin delivery .
3 If an dos@@ ing is required during the patient &apos;s change , this may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
prior to travel that go over several time zones , the patient should be noted to obtain the advice of his physician , as such travels have to be applied , that insulin and meals must be applied to other times .

the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum occurs within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire active duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and young people The phar@@ ma bi@@ kin@@ i profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of di@@ abe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between the ages of 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , however the assumption is close to that the pharmac@@ ok@@ y profile is similar to children and adolescents from adults .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already had signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in joints ) or plaster notes ( &quot; St@@ ones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystalline deposits , which can lead to gel and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ imal , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first time of treatment , tox@@ in cases can still occur . therefore , it is recommended that the patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ icity .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ tation , as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared with placebo ( head@@ medi@@ ums ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hypertension ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients who did Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are heada@@ ches , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( N@@ au@@ sea ) , rash , and ab@@ normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart failure in the history , there may also be an increased risk of certain adverse events affecting the heart and blood vessels .
finally , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that Aden@@ ur@@ ic had been active in the blood more efficient than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of adverse events related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hypertension in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the health story well known or currently under present plaster ) and / or a plaster .
if the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid level amounts to 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) , can be considered a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
patients with severe kidney disease have not been investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and young people have no experiences yet with children and young people , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

cardiovascular disease in patients with severe heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended for the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ fying medication , it may occur during treatment to an acute remedy , because by lowering the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid resp@@ i@@ eg@@ i@@ eg@@ els , it can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue .

liver disease while clinical studies in phase 3 were observed with slight decrease of liver values with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function before the start of the February ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin Z@@ was not performed inter@@ ruption studies on Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ den ( a inhibit@@ ing of the met@@ abol@@ ization of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
at subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with a rise in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ icide , the magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ id , delay the intake of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .

a paid higher incidence of the test reported by the test kit was observed in the total feb@@ ru@@ ary study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no significant connection with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kler@@ os@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the hospital .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and the ( test average evaluation ) could be recorded in connection with the medicine and in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups a total of more than once were listed below .

7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open @-@ time extension studies were 906 patients up to 1 year long , 322 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the un@@ treated events reported during the long @-@ term - extension studies were similar to those in the studies of phase 3 ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treated events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long@@ time extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported or reported in the regim@@ ent studies of phase 3 for these doses either or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study described below ) , which were performed with 1.8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and plaster .
in each study , the primary efficacy point was in each study of the patients who were the last three monthly ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid level &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ en@@ ish value at the beginning of the course of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment of conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) and statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority for the treatment of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional use Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the Ser@@ m@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ id@@ y at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 / mol / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in week 2 and maintain permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ en@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney cancer . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney disease ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the percentage of the serum concentration of kidney disease , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ act study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years showed that the permanent reduction of the frequency response to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) showed that less than 3 % of patients required in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a plaster ) .
this was associated with a reduction in tox@@ ic@@ ation size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of gyp@@ sum no@@ des to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ time extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentr@@ ates ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration simpler and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , the AU@@ C is greater than the dos@@ ing proportional increase .
after taking easier or multi@@ functional doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration concentration was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent bars @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 mg after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma combination of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistently reaching the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that this oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites are formed primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id primarily arises by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ed Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at about 49 % of the dose occurred in the urine as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to distinction about the urine , some 45 % of the dose last found in the chair as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure . after taking multi pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild to moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in the ratio of normal kidney function .
the middle total AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times of 7.5 m / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function on 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver working limitation after taking multiple sclerosis of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moder@@ ately ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function , the C@@ max and AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the metabolism of the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC dose when compared to younger subjects were observed .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fert@@ ility In male rats a statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary dr@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ treated group , with approximately 11 times the exposure of the people .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metab@@ olic and urine composition , and not relevant for clinical use as a result of clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fert@@ ility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were about the 4.@@ 3- or of the therapeutic exposure , the matern@@ al tox@@ icity came on , walking with a reduction in the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ ower and a development delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions that approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and while supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects showed .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or use of other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplement ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of feeding a meal , the patient may not take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

agra@@ agra@@ f is administered by adult patients , a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted in order to prevent the organ of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ ud@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t were submitted , whereby the application of sub@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in were compared .
the main indic@@ ative of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ tation was down after a year of treatment ( for example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter studies have been carried out for 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and investigated objec@@ agra@@ f compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

only doctors who entrusted with the immune soup and treatment of transplan@@ tations should be entrusted to this medicine or make changes in the immune condition .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , this can result in gra@@ fts or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ taking or overweight .
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; alter@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be made under the close control of a medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
following a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dos@@ iz@@ ations must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ m remains .
the dosage of V@@ agra@@ f should be primarily based on clinical assessment of removal and compatibility in single case and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; recommendations
after upgra@@ ding from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus valley level should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after the change@@ over .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure was measured as a valley level , both in both kidney and organ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ m valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under je@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ mat@@ isation phase .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ m is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , may take an adaptation of the agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the j@@ ady State reaches .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application for the supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation , the immun@@ om@@ ression has to be maintained ; therefore , a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified .
dos@@ ing recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ tation proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the oral care therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift of the morning .
further dos@@ iz@@ ations may be required later , as the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can change the course of stab@@ ilization of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ting Adv@@ ance Pro@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift of the morning .
dos@@ ing Recomm@@ end@@ ation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily , so this change@@ over has to be taken at a time of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after a change from other immune soup to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with both in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation is recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
transplan@@ tation By adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day .
other transplan@@ ts , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ m , pan@@ cre@@ as and dar@@ kened patients , came in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 @-@ 0,15 mg / kg / day , in pan@@ cre@@ atively initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with gut transplan@@ t in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ ing adaptation in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining aperture mirror in the targeted range can be necessary in patients with heavy liver disorders a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ine ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including regular determination of the serum curve ) is recommended , a calculation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f at the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ as on a T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is be careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to Tal@@ mirror in the whole blood . the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of removal and compatibility in single fall under state @-@ of @-@ blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ valley @-@ controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ valley levels of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dos@@ ing adaptation , changes of immune soup , or by simultaneous use of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady State is entered .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of T@@ acro@@ li@@ m lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for garn@@ ished - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t , blood concentrations generally were used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus sub or interference .
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be made under the close control of a medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which has been proven to other immun@@ om@@ ou@@ si@@ va as a therap@@ ist , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ation formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation with adult heart transplan@@ t and transplan@@ t receivers in childhood are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ation formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a reduction of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ cular mirror in the blood and a atten@@ u@@ ation of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant pur@@ ification during a treatment with paragraphs ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ cular concentrations in the blood is offered as the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases less than Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y was observed in rare cases , which may therefore occur under the agra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid load and oil .
as with other immun@@ om@@ ou@@ si@@ va , the interaction of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients who use T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of P@@ res such as heada@@ che , change levels of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision problems should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .

the simultaneous use of medication or vegetable medic@@ ations which are known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase the blood values of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ cular levels at the same time , monitor the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to monitor the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintaining uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was performed with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cott , such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the M@@ acro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood cholesterol was mainly due to the elevated bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal metab@@ olic syndrome .
high @-@ rating pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute dis@@ rup@@ tions , can increase the concentration of T@@ acro@@ li@@ m in the blood or lower .
the effect of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus with medication may metab@@ oli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism will affect the metabolism .
since T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a and thus increase the hormon@@ al exposure , it is especially careful of decisions on the underlying measures .
the results of animal experim@@ entation have shown that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend its half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of examinations on transplan@@ tation consultants does not provide a consideration that , under T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus an increased risk for undes@@ i@@ rable events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended to possible adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , ie :
the imp@@ acting profile of immune soup can often be found precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .
below are the effects of adverse events following their frequency in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( incidence on the basis of the available data estimates ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ ropath@@ y and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi @-@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immune care therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about dry or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated l@@ ym@@ ph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with the treatment with T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ sol@@ uble and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma map@@ rot@@ eine can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ tic .
active mechanism and a dynamic effects on molecular levels can be medi@@ ated by the effects of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the inc@@ enti@@ ment of the connection in the cell .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um @-@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal transfer due to T @-@ cell and prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

also chronic transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ - syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % vs. 8,@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ mi@@ et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ et had to be converted ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted by T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ tation was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % vs. 4@@ 3,3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ mi@@ et al . , J Heart is transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients treated with T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus patients .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ ric value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ found faction of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus , or for treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , the metabolism of the metabolism will be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates .
this means that T@@ acro@@ li@@ m is almost entirely metab@@ olic before the distinction , the differentiation mainly takes place above the track .
in stable patients who were taken up from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) in the ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than under pro@@ gra@@ f at approximately 10 % lower than under pro@@ gra@@ f .

Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevention of blood in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital bleeding ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application is to be addressed if the treatment is applied to the treatment of blood cells or preventing bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method that describes as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar in the European Union approved medicines named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , is differently manufactured , so the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with serious to moderate h@@ ed@@ oph@@ ilia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was investigated by preventing bleeding as well as surgical intervention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ant@@ ments was awarded with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 86 % of 510 new blood levels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Schwin@@ n , heada@@ che , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII .
it may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ utter factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval for the placing on the market of Adv@@ ant@@ ments in the European Union .
dosage The dos@@ ing and duration of the constitu@@ ent therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ defect , after the location and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
with the following domestic rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity is not to drop under the specified plas@@ m@@ asp@@ tiles ( in % of the standard or in the i.e. i.e. i.e. i.e. i.e. in the ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and the acute danger are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of patients is past .
during treatment course , the control of the administered dose and frequency of inj@@ ections is an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma image .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and different half times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of blood in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A are to be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. factor VIII per kg of body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ ze should not be achieved or if the blood of blood is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to verify a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be er@@ ased .
the rate of appo@@ intments is to be addressed according to the patient &apos;s finding , with maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication during treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , rejected Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 positions is the biggest and from genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ P ) with more than 100 individual days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tic inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product on another , the re @-@ act of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare emergence of H@@ äm@@ oph@@ ilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and still life .
those in the largest number of patients treated A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which have occurred in previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk for education of inhibit@@ ors , heada@@ ches ( 5 patients ) , fever and Schwin@@ n ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data not ab@@ rated ) .

the blood flow was maintained during all the time and maintain the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavier to moderate h@@ ed@@ oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure compared to 26 ex@@ positions ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed an inhibit@@ or @-@ inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. modified in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , one of the 53 pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with a serious to moderate h@@ aul oph@@ ilia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure compared to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrate ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously not treated patients with an ongoing clinical study of 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E patients treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamin@@ ated proteins was analyzed by the examination of the anti @-@ body composition against this proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant up@@ trend and a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cells , otherwise no signs or symptoms , which was referred to an allergic reaction , or more sensitive to an allergic reaction .
in four patients the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ople reported in several repeated product texts within the framework of the study .

the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective parts in the human body , carries normally damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells may increase and share .
the company put data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the building , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers from the company , there were still some questions solved .
based on the exam of the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP is created on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore was not sufficient for the patient .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven that it can be established in a reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment , nor for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company was unable to consider the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ mil@@ ion @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the active ingre@@ dient means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hypo@@ thes@@ es , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len inflamm@@ ation of the nose path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al grin@@ d cheese ( stored nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken completely with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and finished as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( di@@ pped nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on the pen@@ gu@@ ing of the nose .
the main effect dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p@@ ens@@ n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome which was reported by the patient prior to the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients receiving their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated by a standard scale as heavily the symptoms in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ p@@ ens@@ n@@ ymp@@ t@@ ome , the patients reported in Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze had a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.9 % in patients who had p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ ment alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed an increase of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who lost the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ ments , sw@@ elling , psych@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ vity ) , hi@@ pp@@ ie ( appetite ) , hi@@ pp@@ ie , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nie ( insom@@ nia ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
in patients who may not be sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ in or one of the other components , against ad@@ re@@ ty active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for treating aller@@ gies ) .
in case of patients , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ om@@ angle glaucoma ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hypertension ) , disease or vas@@ cular diseases ( hypertension ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval for the market launch of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to break , break or chew@@ ed ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the absence of data to im@@ authenti@@ cation and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after un@@ sound the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els can take from time .
after the decline of s@@ ill @-@ skins in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els contains , the drug is also con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed in patients treated with a Mon@@ o@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etry activity in combin@@ ated application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ aders , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ y@@ dro@@ pl@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ cology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ aders , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s disease and do not submit the data to arrange corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
safety and effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit their data to arrange corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
the patients need to be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or speed@@ ometer , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as heada@@ ches or rein@@ forcement of heada@@ ches ) must be informed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups it is recommended to be careful : patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension and patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction in the p@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bl@@ adder or bronze memory in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze explo@@ sives at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent .
in addition to clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ ic tests , no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the placebo @-@ treated patients could be detected , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
this is not yet identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not block and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the imp@@ ur@@ ality of use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected gest@@ ions , however , no increasing frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and should not be applied to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ in pregnancy .
however , the patient should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases , in very rare cases , it can lead to a benefit of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S @-@ Depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , com@@ a , heart @-@ circulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ior .

a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , just like At@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ ligen@@ ce , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ature cells / bases as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adult P selection on end@@ oth@@ el@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of fluor@@ o@@ gens , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day , there was no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ ters in the recommended dosage can reveal further symp@@ tom im@@ etry , such as an increase of blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal aller@@ g@@ ic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ amin@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined using the overall interest for the symptoms ( except nose grin@@ d cheese ) significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined using the nas@@ al grin@@ d cheese , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ec@@ table within 30 minutes after administration .
according to the Peru@@ vian application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ ine was reached on day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ a@@ inet@@ d study , which was conducted with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were badly affected .
a components inter@@ act study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ at@@ can be organic equivalent to the exposure of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on security systems , tox@@ icity in re@@ treated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive clean@@ ers , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot recognize any special haz@@ ards for human beings .
the combination had no tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredients p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els .
in re@@ productive studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els was in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inclusion ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve itself in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children ages one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or w .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or w .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal aller@@ g@@ ic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( tra@@ ck@@ ling , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ ens , interference of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment was measured .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to the inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
when allergic rhin@@ itis resulted when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms of symptoms of 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two trials at Ur@@ tik@@ aria the acceptance of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the SP Europe approval for the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease exp@@ ir@@ ation and can be completed again after the sound of symptoms and their re @-@ act .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in the context of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in addition to the ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , it was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patient should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ om@@ men@@ eness , which can lead to an imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic resistance , or the ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic documents , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events related to patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events , which was more common than placebo were ti@@ re@@ dness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ ches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent cap@@ tiv@@ ating heada@@ che was treated with 5.9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose trial , up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ pul@@ ators cy@@ to@@ k@@ ic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ature cells / bases as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adult P selection at En@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al@@ cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of fluor@@ o@@ gens , including rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the ten@@ der@@ ing of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ ling , Tr@@ än@@ tie , Tr@@ endel@@ burg on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the total of freight in the life of life with Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively explo@@ res the burden of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ep@@ tic@@ aria was also examined for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology eman@@ ology in the different forms is similar , and chronic patients can be recruited via a simple spec@@ tively .
since the history of hist@@ opath@@ ic diseases is expected by all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also associated with other forms of ur@@ tik@@ aria for an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic , the minority of the patients who did not react to Anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic , was excluded from the study .
improvement of the youth strike by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with placebo in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the error of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in an Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which the patients were similar to patients with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ population was comparable to 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no points of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , this is not yet identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ mes , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not block and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg made food ( fat , cal@@ orie breakfast ) not to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical studies conducted by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a comparable degree of the exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in re@@ treated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive clean@@ ers , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be seen in no special haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ption doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper bre@@ aths or anatom@@ ic anom@@ al@@ ies , there should be a role in diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and check@@ ups .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 are metab@@ olic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher sub@@ load rating ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , the restricted metab@@ olic , is identical to those with children who metab@@ olic .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems should not take a fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ ol@@ ation , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in addition to the ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , it was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall effects of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group as at the placebo group .
clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events related to patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who came into question for a antibodies dose of 1.25 mg received a daily dose dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets brought tablets with adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no benefit of the psych@@ ic acid .
in clinical @-@ phar@@ ma @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was not affected by the simultaneous intake of alcohol either to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced power levels .
with adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the linear@@ ity of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ ling , Tr@@ än@@ tie and Roman of the eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ ling on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total of freight in the life of life with Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us pills effectively empha@@ si@@ sted through seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted Phen@@ ot@@ ype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in the black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in chew@@ ing @-@ asi@@ um ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar phar@@ ma pharmac@@ tical parameters were observed in an pharmac@@ ok@@ a@@ inet@@ d study with Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulate of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , the restricted metab@@ olic syndrome .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no points of clin@@ ically relevant active ingre@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at the recommended doses were similar to those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , this is not yet identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ mes , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene closing plate with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent polystyrene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application for preparations for inser@@ ting with scal@@ ings of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .

directly before applying the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats are taken from being taken without damage .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in addition to which ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic documents , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day when patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was taken good for use ; this was documented through clinical laboratory results , medical examination , vit@@ al@@ sign and EC@@ G intervals .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth of the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day , there was no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no influence on standard measurement ranges of fluor@@ o@@ rest@@ ation including the rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the ten@@ der@@ y of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ ling , Tr@@ än@@ tie , Tr@@ endel@@ burg on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total of freight in the life of life with Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively explo@@ res the burden of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets once daily put in the mouth , for the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
immediately before applying the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the melting tablet is taken , without damaged them .
the efficacy and dis@@ ability of a@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tray in treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall effects of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not significantly reduced the safety profile in the adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tray proved to be equal to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for breaking down formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine during a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically proven .

the overall analysis of the pre@@ clinical and clinical eye tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an un@@ likely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted metab@@ olic , is identical to those with children who metab@@ olic .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fruit toler@@ ances , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
the overall effects of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in group , similar to the placebo group .
among young children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events were recorded , more common than placebo , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study on a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( see paragraph 5.2 ) were similar in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents has no increased frequency of stro@@ kes in comparison to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis is , depending on the duration of symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis , and
as shown on the basis of the total of freight in rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively reducing the burden through seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the spread of this restricted Phen@@ ot@@ ype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in the black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in chew@@ ing @-@ asi@@ um ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study is required and it is to be expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for the placing on the market of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for protection against influ@@ enza , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine , which may cause a tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus is diving , which can easily spread a human being , because people don &apos;t have imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus as a &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forming antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus of this gene@@ alog@@ y .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m surface , which recognizes the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , is cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient to comply with the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you need to participate in a clinical study and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s treatment .
if you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendation of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , with the humane immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but this can not be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be imposed if the physician investig@@ ates which anti@@ viral drugs in the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that the virus continues to speak on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not want to heal AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and the development of AIDS infections and diseases can also appear .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this medic@@ inal anti @-@ induced R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had previously used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change in the vir@@ us@@ load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or had had a viral load of more than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults , which had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the anti @-@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gen@@ ase , as effective after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ a along with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who had their existing prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ che , di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea ( di@@ stra@@ y ) , op@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , rash , and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase can not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase can also not be applied to patients who are being min@@ ed ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , that are the same as A@@ gen@@ ase and are in high concentrations in the blood of health @-@ harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , A@@ gen@@ ase is taking the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ap@@ se ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection which caused by the recovered immune system ) .
finally , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ cal amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates .
in October 2000 , the European Commission donated the Gla@@ xo Group to submit an approval for the market launch of A@@ gen@@ ase in the whole European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ a@@ inet@@ ical Boo@@ ster@@ e@@ al Boo@@ ks@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ c@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inclusion is 14 % less than one capsule . therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying supplement of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ections were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to dis@@ use@@ fulness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ cal data the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with mild or moderate liver failure , in patients with severe liver failure , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase cannot be given simultaneously with medication which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the Johann@@ is we@@ eds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r during the in@@ gest@@ ion of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other comp@@ lications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ast@@ o@@ ase prevents the risk of transmission of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
please read about the case of an equivalent treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including a chron@@ ically active hepatitis , show a increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ co@@ ok@@ ti@@ co@@ ids are not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ auses and supplement of the side effects ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the aggreg@@ ates of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous use of Lov@@ e@@ ye@@ e and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ot@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards ratios ) , methods are available for determining the concentration concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma brick ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metab@@ olic inter@@ actions with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a may be changed , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time using Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ric ymp@@ t@@ ome , especially if even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be given .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity of a tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity , this intest@@ inal form for children under a age of four years con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed and should be used with cau@@ tion in certain other patient groups .
ast@@ ase should be set to a duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symp@@ tom , or the mu@@ c@@ els are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other ill@@ nesses which were required to treat their therapy , which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metab@@ olic disorders associated with it .
in case of h@@ ul@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports above an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ ome and Hä@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune effect , a inflamm@@ atory reaction on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ ist infections can develop , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune soup ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV @-@ condition and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic latitude cannot be given simultaneously with medication which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic width of ast@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r cannot be combined with medication , whose active ingredients are primarily connected to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and connected to the increased plasma image with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logic failure and to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma brick by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ i@@ rable effects of the liver were observed .
cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r can be lower with the simultaneous use of plant preparations with cur@@ is@@ we@@ eds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already assumes cur@@ rant , the ampl@@ itudes mirror and if possible , to verify the vir@@ us@@ load and add the cur@@ is@@ we@@ eds .
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ ly avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ c@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ est below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrate the effectiveness and dis@@ ability of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % lower when Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) reached with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended not to be a close monitoring since the effectiveness and dis@@ advantage of this combination is not known .
in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , it is recommended that it is recommended to meet di@@ stra@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ est in combination with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not necessary .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ est in combination with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and available limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma tiles even less effective .
when these medicines are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic surveillance should be made , because an accurate forecast of the combination of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be found on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ ker@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ je@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ ker@@ ut@@ in at 193 % , and thereby resulting in an increase in related side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ den@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ w@@ ase is recommended to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ ker@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ cal studies with ast@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma asp@@ tiles of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ a@@ avi@@ or with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily lead to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ per@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used in common with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly result in inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions , which are monitored by these medication , if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ servers al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma brick .
the serum concentration of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ ver@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ pp@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of A@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentr@@ ates , including P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in associated side effects including h@@ yp@@ ot@@ ence , visual acuity and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluor@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at plas@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , while the end@@ ogen@@ ous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol declined by about 86 % ( 90 % decrease interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended in collaboration with these glucose concentrations , unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ related effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive nar@@ rates of the plasma torque has been expected to be expected by A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended .
there is a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stab@@ ilization of the mirror , since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ li@@ mus can be increased to the same time as Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used along with oral care of the oral disease ( see Section 4.3 ) , while using A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al care is offered as cau@@ tion .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ ted Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ amide with other prot@@ ections indicate a possible rise in the plasma cutting of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ric ymp@@ t@@ ome , especially if even low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be given .
because of its low reliability of historical ver@@ bs , no recommendation can be given at present , like the Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is given if Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in simultaneous extraction of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratios ) is recommended for the possibility of a atten@@ u@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a is not predi@@ ctable , therefore alternative ways are recommended to conception .
a careful surveillance of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended in the early age of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during the pregnancy of the possible use@@ ment of possible use@@ ment for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for fo@@ etus .
in milk l@@ activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is over@@ thrown in people &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study on dre@@ ad@@ able rats that was administered by the in@@ hal@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the down@@ time Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduction in the 12 body weight during the down@@ time .
the further development of descendants including fermentation and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r .
imp@@ ur@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in adults and children over 4 years in clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the associated side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , rose early and led to the treatment break@@ away .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time , whether they are applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease .
most of the mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which were not treated twice daily with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the test in connection with the study medi@@ ation , were performed and more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment of tre@@ ach laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy was associated with HIV @-@ patients in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripher@@ y and fa@@ zi@@ al fat tissues , multiple intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ y of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ cer@@ al fat collection ( stem cells ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated people who had been treated with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a middle duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stem cells ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred in 245 NR@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is above a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
normally , skin suggestions were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ ed or ma@@ sted paper , with or without ju@@ ck@@ ling and occurred spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune effect , the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory reaction on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ zing R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degrees 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes in patients who were treated with low gly@@ ceri@@ de and CP@@ K values , those in patients who were treated with low do@@ si@@ zing R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are to be used .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ bla@@ stic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood @-@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r on HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not defined yet .
in the treatment of anti@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ per@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - such as other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r el@@ oo@@ ks were observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
at sixteen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ sil@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ist occurred until week 48 , whereby 14 Isol@@ ate gen@@ ot@@ ype could be investigated .
a gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical analysis of isol@@ ate 13 of 14 children , with a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ical failure in the 59 included , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not appear pre@@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those with adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ per@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors were reported in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical resistance systems , Gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ per@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an u@@ pr@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical resistance on Fos@@ am@@ per@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ational systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ atic resistance classification , clin@@ ically valid phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical data to the assessment of the activity of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies such as diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against am@@ it@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cruci@@ fix@@ ion against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity of In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ ly avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remained generally in general .
there are currently data on the cruci@@ fix@@ ion between Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ per@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of five and five anti@@ viral therapy ( one of them reported a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resi@@ sti@@ ve ins@@ ulating ins@@ ist ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
early release of a reconc@@ ile therapy is recommended to keep the accum@@ ulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries per@@ taining to the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with the lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with retro@@ spec@@ ulated virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the vir@@ us@@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was used to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low d@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) together with A@@ gener@@ ase administered N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared with the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Based on this data should be considered to be considered in@@ treated with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after administration is the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ c@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after the dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
hence the minimum concentration in the j@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r from the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ compressed Am@@ c@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active proportion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ puff@@ ed ampl@@ itudes remained constant , the percentage of free active ingre@@ dient during the dos@@ ing process , depending on the aggreg@@ ates concentration in the j@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore medicines that induc@@ ing C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duce or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with cau@@ tion when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the pre@@ valence of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ c@@ avi@@ r exposure like an adult dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available as of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance on the elimination of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ c@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mask similar to those who are generated with healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on mice with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , in case of male animals , he@@ ath@@ ocular Aden@@ ome with doses of exposure to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the people , after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the I@@ o@@ cellular Adenauer and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of this observed effects for human being is un@@ clear .
from the present ex@@ changes data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , somewhat more information for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , bacterial cell l@@ ym@@ ph@@ oma test , micro@@ o@@ resc@@ ence test on rats and chromosome test to human peripheral l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase , nor after the end of treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity at young , treated from a age of 4 days , showed both at the control as well as with Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality .
in system@@ ic plasma volume , which was significantly less ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage of humans , however , a number of slight changes , including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes are observed , which point to a delayed development .
24 . if A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be applied without the ampli@@ fying supplement of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with low or lighter liver working with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver failure , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see Section 4.3 ) .

a dos@@ ing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended not to be a close monitoring since the effectiveness and dis@@ advantage of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ est in combination with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be low .
when these medicines are used together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logic surveillance should be made , because an accurate forecast of the combination of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be found on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ den@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ w@@ ase will be given to a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ ker@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .

the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ per@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resi@@ sti@@ ve ins@@ ulating ins@@ ist ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
based on these data , the benefit of therapy for the expected benefit of &quot; non @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ly &quot; ast@@ ase are expected to be considered .

the application samples and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma it is applied for six weeks twice a week . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ os , it is applied during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is diluted in front of bed@@ time to the affected skin surfaces , so that it remains sufficient for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the active ingre@@ dient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with waiting in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indic@@ ative for efficacy was the number of patients treated with full waste treatment . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or twice a week or five times a week .
the main indic@@ ative for the efficacy was the number of patients with full healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies at a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ s .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more efficient than the placebo . • In the treatment of waiting in the genital area , the full healing rate was reduced by 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two trials showed up to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions are generally accepted during therapy or reactions , after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if due to the patient &apos;s problems or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made of several days .
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , a super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma should be moved to other suitable therapy forms .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ C@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .

I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ balls on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the surface area within the lift .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ os at anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the poor and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take over the course of therapy to intensity or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local skin reactions result in the patient a big dis@@ comfort or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 actors les@@ ions showed a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with cau@@ tion in patients who received a immune soup ( see 4.4 ) .

according to investig@@ ational evaluation of clinical signs , clinical signs shows that it is often found in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion / rem@@ n@@ ants ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ re@@ ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to investig@@ ational evaluation of clinical signs , clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Creme very often to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and heavy cas@@ u@@ ction ( 19 % ) came .
in clinical trials to study the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ z@@ ie was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment location or in the surrounding area .
the unique unique or@@ ic intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , heada@@ che , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious adverse effect which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in H@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized itself after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha@@ be@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 appro@@ vals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the treatment is far superior to a placebo treatment for 16 weeks .
at 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . this was 20 % of the patients treated with placebo in the case ( 95 % CI ) .
full healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five times use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ olog@@ ically confirmed the primary super @-@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this continued for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three @-@ week application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ c , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ cal les@@ ions within an inter@@ connected 25 cm2 major treatment than on the un@@ ha@@ i@@ ded scal@@ p or in the face .
the season data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment time periods .
the approved indications , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients generally not on and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four randomised , double @-@ blind @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or for a period of ≤ 16 weeks .
a minimum system@@ ic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest medicine concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applying in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 one bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ time span was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates the extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
data to system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of age and comparable with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month trial laying down tox@@ icity at r@@ amps carried out doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg . kg of weight down to significantly reduced weight and increased lac@@ z weight ; one also resulted in a similar effects for four months in the mouse there was no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity of mice in mice on three days a week does not induced tum@@ ors at the application point .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small system@@ ic absorption of the human skin and is not dirty , the risk of people because of systematic exposure is very low .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free cream , previously and in a greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms do as you . − If any of the side effects listed you have significantly imp@@ aired or you will not notice any side effects , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

usually , it is easier to anim@@ ate skin reactions that sound again within about 2 weeks after demol@@ ition of the treatment .
some patients may notice changes at application location ( W@@ und@@ hal@@ t , inflamm@@ ation , sw@@ elling , shame , der@@ mat@@ itis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , fierce symptoms and ti@@ re@@ dness .
occasionally , some patients suffer from the application location ( Blu@@ ten , Infl@@ amm@@ ation , cervical or dis@@ comfort ) , anti @-@ oxid@@ ation , oxid@@ ation of eyel@@ ids , vert@@ eb@@ oo@@ cy@@ tic ker@@ at@@ osis , bre@@ aches , fac@@ ial sw@@ elling , sc@@ ans , breakdown , weakness or mixing fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzy@@ mes in patients with a secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ er@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ ol@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that do not stand with brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cer@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ e , g@@ ags ) will not be dismant@@ led and therefore , in most organs in the body and to them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the MP@@ S I may occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , stim@@ ulating movements , dimin@@ ished lung volumes , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inherited metab@@ olic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and the patients need appropriate medicines in order to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but it was also measured its effectiveness ( in relation to the reduction of the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) .
at the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine at about 60 % and half of the treated children demonstrated at the end of the study a normal big liver .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ ches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in li@@ mb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and mixing fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be very sensitive to patients who may not react strongly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medi@@ c@@ eries Agency ( EMEA ) will be able to check all new information which may be well @-@ known , and this is to be updated accordingly .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued the G@@ enzyme Europe B.@@ V. a licence for the placing on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ ities α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative for patients with a secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ er@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ est@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other inherited metab@@ olic diseases .
the initial In@@ fu@@ sions rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is carrying out all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established , and for these patients no dos@@ ing regim@@ en can be recommended .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing regim@@ en can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fu@@ sive reactions that are defined as any other side effects , which occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be monitored in close mes@@ h@@ ed , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done only in a reasonable clinical environment , in re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies immediately .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months from the treatment course .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fu@@ sive reaction must be treated with care by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , there must be careful risk reaction due to the theoreti@@ cally increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medic@@ ations ( Anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic and / or anti @-@ py@@ or@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential appearance of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be er@@ ased and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction has occurred .
in the event of a single heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are to be decreased , a treatment with Anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be weakened .
in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction has occurred .
3 are ( Anti@@ hist@@ opath@@ ic and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies are not allowed to close direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the breast milk , it is recommended to take care during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse reactions in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fu@@ sions related to 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment time of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted medication changes in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me which were observed during the period of 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are often listed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with heavier MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper bre@@ aths and lungs , in addition , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , bre@@ wing and fac@@ ial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted medication effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly heavy inter@@ mitt@@ ent form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby the patients at the age of 5 came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ ia ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not reported by Radio@@ immune resolutions ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ec@@ table antibodies before , among them 3 patients , where it was never too ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with l@@ acked under low anti @-@ body mirror showed a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the urine .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ale until low @-@ neutr@@ alis@@ ing effect on the enzyme activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduce the reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse drug actions , even if the occurrence of adverse medicines are typically used with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the preventing of further accum@@ ulation adequate restoration of the enzyme .
after an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed from the circulation and of cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely of man@@ osis @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ ts recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients ranged from the central phen@@ ot@@ ype , and only one patient had the severe phen@@ ot@@ ype .
patients were recruited if they had an exp@@ ir@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me had an improvement of lung function and the ability to see which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ alp@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of pro@@ spective FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over this period of clinical and absolute lung @-@ volumes increased proportional to the height @-@ growing children .
of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atomic fact before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel was detected in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) that remained constant until the end of the study .
in regard to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who are using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes in five @-@ minute walk , motion range of the shoulder joint Ah@@ i and visual acuity , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who were studied at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy inter@@ run form and 4 with the medium run form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirrors per week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium volume form , whereas in case of the older patients with severe failure rate , limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations to al@@ co @-@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ met@@ ering schem@@ es were performed on the G@@ ag @-@ Mir@@ rors in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent any adverse alternative in patients who represent difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ es is equal .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information which will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medication will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ical profile in patients aged under 5 years of age was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on security systems , tox@@ icity at a time gift , tox@@ icity in recur@@ rent gift and re@@ productions , the pre@@ clinical data do not allow any special haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta has also been compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously obtained non @-@ chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in survived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el when compared to 7.9 months .
however , in both studies , patients suffering from cancer @-@ epi@@ thel@@ ium cells were observed in both studies , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared with the compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli L@@ illy Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a licence for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each flow bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chl@@ oride ( 9 mg / ml ) , which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ sis is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chl@@ oride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for the first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ clear bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for the vast epi@@ thel@@ ial history of epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ separate bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma unless the gender equality epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the end of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non@@ woven bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ance of skin reactions needs to be given a day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ation gift as well as in the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake should be continued during the entire period of therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also have to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third processing cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ eds , a whole blood image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ret@@ um .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dos@@ ing test must take place under Ber@@ del@@ u@@ ation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ug@@ matic tox@@ icity of the pre @-@ temper@@ ament therapy cycles .
after the recovery , the patient must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with Cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ as C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood .
if patients do not develop @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient had the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA needs to be canc@@ eled , if in patients after 2 dos@@ ing products , a domestic tox@@ icity or non @-@ ug@@ matic tox@@ icity or non @-@ ug@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue with the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that patients at the age of 65 years or more compared to patients aged 65 years is an increased secondary effect .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended to use for children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data to dis@@ ability and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cancer in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dos@@ iz@@ ations required to go out for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cancer in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver failure of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not especially examined in studies .
patients need to be monitored in regard to the Kno@@ ef@@ in Ex@@ reg@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be given to patients whose absolute neut@@ ron number is again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thes@@ es of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dos@@ ing for further cycles is based on the absolute neutral density , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ c@@ resc@@ ence and maximum non @-@ ug@@ matic tox@@ icity , such as observed in the previous treatment cycles - see paragraph 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 ug@@ fro@@ sted and ni@@ chth@@ ological tox@@ icity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , feb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed if a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore all patients need to be treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ous patients , folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce un@@ treated tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ) ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - c@@ yl@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and mines ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ase is required to avoid in@@ gest@@ ion of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ation ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid @-@ collection in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergonom@@ ics prior to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is supposed to be er@@ ased .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ ral events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , when this drug is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of the application is not recommended ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible sk@@ in@@ - of re@@ productive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed consists of men should be noted prior to treatment - G@@ inn should be referred to in terms of sperm intake .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oids ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid can result in a high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ase differentiation .
therefore , be careful when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ actic are applied in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and reduction of 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ eds ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data regarding the Inter@@ medi@@ ator is available with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - can be avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ icia and ant@@ ine@@ opla@@ stic chemotherapy , requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratios ) when the decision was made to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with fluctu@@ ation , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ ings an@@ em@@ bos@@ ses are expected to be serious in pregnancy in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except for sure , and after careful handling of the use@@ ment for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible effects of the re@@ productive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed consists of men should be noted prior to the treatment course , consultation with regard to the sperm accounts .
it is not known if p@@ em@@ itter is over@@ turned into the breast milk and undes@@ i@@ rable effects on the nur@@ sing infant can not be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the treatment media in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement in clinical @-@ related symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ome , was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared with the sole c@@ abling in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two lines of the treatment consisted through an improvement of lung functional parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function throughout the time in the check .
a multi@@ center , randomised , open phase III trial with AL@@ IM@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patient with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on the overall survival was observed in favour of AL@@ IM@@ TA with a predominantly non @-@ leg epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6,2 versus 7.4 months , modified HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients who may take the all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should be turning to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hib@@ ited , some fats cannot be dismant@@ led in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats added to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study all@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 and compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg compared to placebo .
the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with more relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are co@@ di@@ ous spots on after , fle@@ atus ( winds ) with chair lab@@ eling , chair ld@@ ur@@ ge , fet@@ al vert@@ eb@@ ra ( rot@@ ting ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing transplan@@ ting patients ) or with medication such as War@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
it may also be applied in patients who are absorbed in a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tive syndrome ( if not enough nutrients are taken out of the digest@@ ive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and with pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission announced the Gla@@ xo Group Limited to submit an author@@ ization to Or@@ li@@ stat GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( body measure index ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ induced nutrition .
all@@ i cannot be used by children and adolescents under 18 because not enough data to the effectiveness and security are given .
however , since Or@@ li@@ stat is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ ated , the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function is not necessary .

the probability of tre@@ st@@ ence of astro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken with a rich single meal or a rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metab@@ olic control , patients who consult a medicine against diabetes prior to the beginning of therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dose of anti @-@ di@@ abe@@ tics must be adjusted separately .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hypertension or an increased cholesterol level should be asked if your doctor or pharmac@@ ist should be adapted to whether the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to prevent additional fluctu@@ ating courses , in order to prevent severe di@@ ar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of oral contra@@ sts ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the inter@@ actions of medication as well as in several cases with the same application of or@@ li@@ stat and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma tiles .
in combination with or@@ li@@ stat or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick Val@@ ues ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients that were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ li@@ stat , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the standard range .
however , patients should be recommended to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin pre@@ par@@ ate before bed@@ time to ensure a sufficient vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ rec@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers that received or@@ li@@ stat , a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ rec@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication , because the absorption of one approved fat is avoided .
the g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the number of people are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , but not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data estimates ) .
the frequency of those notable side effects , which were determined after the market launch by Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population un@@ aware size .
† It is pl@@ au@@ ght that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ ending on possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given to normal and overweight subjects , without any significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported on the market release of or@@ li@@ stat @-@ over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on research and animals , a systematic formation of systematic effects , which are attributable to li@@ fel@@ stat properties of or@@ li@@ stat , can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ atic and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ sions .
clinical studies was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg of or@@ li@@ stat is taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ts have been blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 provides effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ induced nutrition .
the primary parameters , variation of body weight compared with the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3,8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

7 In general , the therapeutic doses of metab@@ li@@ stat could not be detected in plasma and in extreme low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without a sign of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ c patients who was administered at least system@@ ically stressed dose , two main metab@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ysi@@ ed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , identified almost 42 % of the total plasma concentration .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , and chem@@ otherap@@ ies for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting are ( as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as antibodies ) .
the application of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , since the effects in this age group do not be enough information .
this means that the active ingre@@ dient has the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) to prevent the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients who had been treated with Alo@@ xi was not vom@@ iting ( 132 from 223 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients who had been treated with Alo@@ xi was no vom@@ iting ( 153 by 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
by comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission announced the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the market launch of Alo@@ xi in the whole European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi becomes the prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting that induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids before using one prior to the chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on mp@@ ass@@ age , patients with am@@ nesty laws or signs of sub@@ acute ic@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful when treating pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medication which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or that incline to such an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi is to be used in the days after chemotherapy , nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ spect the activity of the five investigated chem@@ otherap@@ eutic agents ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ mb@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ological interaction between one single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a c@@ ady concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based phar@@ ma @-@ based phar@@ ma analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ics and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , do@@ ox@@ et@@ in , an@@ odi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , an@@ odi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies don &apos;t lie before , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is necessary to be considered by the treated doctor .
clinical trials were the most frequently observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to mean side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least probably stood with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ lig@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of persu@@ asion and reactions to the site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar breeds of adverse events showed themselves similar in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of action to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g. of on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously to Day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ila .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , were assigned to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies involving moderate em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ ing chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were similar to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the study of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the I@@ onic and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als to extend the duration of the action schedule .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration of concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose range from 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg .
according to an intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was the average of 11 adult car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ e@@ tical sim@@ ulations , that at once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was comparable to the time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg , however , the C@@ max was higher after the use of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on Met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , which are involved in the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , regarded as un@@ changeable active substance , made around 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt to treat , the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver failure are increasing the terminal elim@@ inations and average systematic exposition with pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is however non @-@ justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum humane exposure to the clinical use , which indicates a small relevance for clinical use .
10 The clinical studies showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als , which are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ lifer@@ ation of action times .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose is given in about the 30@@ st of the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , led to a multiple frequency of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ o@@ cul@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in Thy@@ ro@@ id , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not entirely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results will be assessed as a result for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative test in which the author@@ ization of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C treatment is recommended to be 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on an organic pharmac@@ ist named Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same in@@ active ingre@@ dient should be similar to that which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ten@@ ant &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a viral infection ) of liver disease .
in case of a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue damage indicates , also the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ y@@ Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stim@@ ulates to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data that indicate the comparison of alp@@ he@@ on with ro@@ feron @-@ A ( active ingredients , composition , and purity of medicines , effects , security and effectiveness of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of reference ten@@ ds to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study NSC 631570 was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns were expressed by the fact that data on the stability of the drug and the drug regim@@ es were not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant to reduce the disease in more patients than in the reference case ; Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was used to investigate a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with a cruci@@ fix@@ ion of passing skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or ker@@ f ) , depreciation and se@@ wn wounds applied .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resi@@ sten@@ te Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go does not affect this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface area should not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient and draw alternative treatments .
it acts by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was observed in all five studies of the patients whose infection was spec@@ kl@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo said to the treatment .
in response to the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken into skin numbers , about 90 % of the patients were killed in both groups of treatment .
in these two trials , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been observed in the treatment of dis@@ sz@@ l@@ essen ( eit@@ ed cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections , which have been proven to have been proven to be effective or probably due to MR@@ SA .
the most common adverse event with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a maturity of the order .
finally , the Committee for Human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ time treatment of the following over@@ sized skin infections across the risks were gl@@ aci@@ ated : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , as infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , depreciation or se@@ ams .
in May 2007 , the European Commission announced the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the market launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients who do not constitute an improvement within two to three days are to be investigated once and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a Sen@@ si@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is broken out carefully and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections where MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen or believes ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with phy@@ xi@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistance st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration in the infected spot .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo was not expected due to the low plasma concentration camps , which were observed in humans according to top@@ ical application ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
3 After an oral gift from 2 times a day 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol elevated the medium retin@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations is not required if top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ ulin is used during a systematic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive @-@ productivity after oral administration and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systematic antibiot@@ ic .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go has to be stopped , the benefits of the nur@@ sing infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go Therap@@ y for the woman is to be weakened .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go have used , the most frequently reported adverse event was the event that was about 1 % of the patients .
action method Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ and@@ ro@@ util@@ in , a substance that was isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us th@@ se@@ at@@ eri@@ anus ( former Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein syn@@ thes@@ ia by interaction at a certain binding of the 50s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes that differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ leu@@ ial substances .
data indicate that the binding of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding and the Pep@@ tide transfer centre .
by li@@ aison to this binding point inhibit@@ ing P@@ and@@ ro@@ util@@ ine the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ate , block some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of the entire 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al under@@ units .
based on the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious shapes , a consultation should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ens@@ ate was sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks involving additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and scre@@ ened skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma proteins were obtained .
the rehear@@ sal took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic absorption of humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % ano@@ inting to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirts .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily conve@@ yed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under a lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out more than 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse l@@ ym@@ ph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripher@@ y cy@@ l@@ ymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats , in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation , chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female fert@@ ility of reduced fert@@ ility at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which means that up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure of the human application ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development tools ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .

ambient rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient rix is applied in the framework of one out of two doses of existing vacc@@ inations , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , ambient rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and ensures that the vacc@@ ines existing from two doses can be ended at the end .
if a collecting dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient sounds or other hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
they work vacc@@ ines by forcing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease .
after having received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine manufacturer Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine manufacturer of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered within one of three doses of existing vacc@@ inations .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof of the application of ambient sounds .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ body concentration camp after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambient stages between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children aged between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated anti @-@ body concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient temperatures were similar to a six @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are heada@@ ches , appetite , pain at the injection site , re@@ dness , Mat@@ te ( fatigue ) as well as friction ability .
ambient rix may not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission announced Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals S.@@ A. provides a permit for placing on the market of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ ms with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of election and the second dose to be administered after the first dose .
if a collecting vaccination is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines or with a combination simple .
the anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ induced anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ anti@@ body values are in the same magn@@ itude as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully guaranteed whether the immun@@ op@@ ic persons , which are spoken to hepatitis A@@ - imp@@ ot@@ ation , may also be protected as a protection , as they may not be protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ecting materials , for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , the treatment of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation plan is recommended that the 360 ELISA units contained in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combin@@ ated hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
in case of hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti@@ quity , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
because an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a subtle imp@@ air@@ ment that should be avoided , these injection paths should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ rix can be injected as an exception as an exception as an exception of bleeding in these cases as an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined Di@@ ph@@ an@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - Mum@@ ps @-@ R@@ öt@@ tle @-@ vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ om@@ ou@@ ctive therapy or in patients with immune defects , there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , re@@ dness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ s , heada@@ che and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ate and preser@@ v@@ atives agent .
in clinical trials , 2,0@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination simple .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency ranges of pain and mat@@ s on a calculation basis for a vaccine basis per vaccination , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of ambient temperatures of 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses .
according to the entire vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6,4 % of the subjects who had given ambient temperatures were about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects who received ambient rates , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans inter@@ mod@@ al additive ) .
the incidence of pre@@ st@@ amped pain and mat@@ s was low and comparable to the use of the combination of the combined 3 @-@ cans vaccination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the appearance of local re@@ actions and general actions in the ambient temperatures of 360 ELISA units , in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed .
however , on the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , a frequency response from pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , was not reported per dose .
the share of vacc@@ ines who reported about heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ cans vaccination schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units , in@@ active hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ated hepatitis B@@ - surface anti@@ gen , was statistically significant .
clinical studies conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 @-@ including 15 years were the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , given to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , given to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was performed at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ able ingre@@ dient with three doses .
in the 289 persons whose imm@@ unity was evaluated , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ines significantly higher than with ambient temperature .
the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical compar@@ ative study at the end of the full vaccination series between 1 and 11 @-@ year olds ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with ambient rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ines with a combination of 360 ELISA units , in@@ active hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen .
for individuals who were at the time of Grun@@ ms between 12 and 15 years old , the perme@@ ability of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proved over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperatures in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine .
the immune reaction in this study observed against both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA units , in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the perme@@ ability of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies planned 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination scheme .
if the first dose of ambient sounds in the second year , when using a combined Di@@ ph@@ an@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis type b vaccine is given ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mass m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed for the present formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates such as the earlier formulation .

you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a clear face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect entirely before infection with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ inations were finished with 2 doses .
if you are already infected with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus ( even though you feel like your child feel not un@@ likely or ill or ill ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if you have an allergic reaction on ambient sounds or any part of this vaccine is shown , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can cause respiratory irrit@@ ation , breathing not or sw@@ amps of the face or tongue . • If with you / your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to a earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
in case of a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will give you / your child of a vaccination with ambient rates .
instead , he will recommend your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective products per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a combined hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface anti@@ gen ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine is given with reduced content of effective stock is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you an vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series .
sometimes the Ambi@@ rix of people suffer from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weakened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own body , or if you are pulling in a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction on the vaccine is .

however , it may be that the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambient sounds , it should be vacc@@ inated to separate places and as possible as possible .
if ambient rix are used at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , ambient rix or lac@@ t@@ ating women will not be given unless it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs at 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data published since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the placing on the market , CH@@ MP occurred that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
because Ambi@@ rix was only available in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of small patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ complete enzyme , or with hyper@@ hi@@ mic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) .
ammon@@ ium is administered - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , under the food or through a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach mixture into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose onde ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
this was not a compar@@ ative study , as ammon@@ ium has not been compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a placebo @-@ drug , i.e. without any active ingre@@ dient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to appetite @-@ loss , s@@ nor@@ ms , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , heada@@ che , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
in the end , the committee for human health agent ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that ammon@@ ium has prevented with patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ i@@ bility values .
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; because due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine templates .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with a complete enzyme already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manipul@@ ate form ( in@@ complete enzyme , which is manifested according to the first living mon@@ at ) , there is an indication for use if in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , hyper@@ op@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with s@@ ill dysfunction is also available in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein toler@@ ances and the necessary daily intake of the patient &apos;s daily intake intake .
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight above 20 kg and with adult @-@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manipul@@ ate deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ate synthetic carbonate or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ c bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a g@@ inal in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ ine deficiency , Ar@@ gin@@ ine must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² per day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with s@@ ill disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not enter into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) , sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as in case with sodium , and eco @-@ induced clinical conditions only with cau@@ tion .
since met@@ abol@@ ism and differentiation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate of young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal failure and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cervical syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional neur@@ en@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ni@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the breast milk , and this is why the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the down@@ time is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in 56 % of patients at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events did not have assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patient who developed a metab@@ olic end@@ omet@@ ri@@ opath@@ y with lac@@ t@@ ach@@ i@@ et , serious hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ als of neu@@ ropath@@ y and panic .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old small child with a visible single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms occur with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing limiting ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a metab@@ olic active connection that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ ylene with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier for the differentiation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of bias of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amin @-@ nitrogen are produced for each gram .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was set early and the treatment is started to improve the chances of survival and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of early @-@ manipul@@ ated form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ in , and the disease itself resulted in treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ ling free analogue within the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative way of nit@@ rous amino acids ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ov@@ yl@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first living month ) diagnose diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it came with many other intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ ien@@ cies .
in patients with a late @-@ manipul@@ ated form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ c bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ op@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients another deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which becomes con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mes , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites were subjected to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in an empty healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after an intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ s in tablets , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ id@@ ate was det@@ ec@@ table in plasma .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which have repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in plasma proteins were five times higher than after the first gifts .
differentiation The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ icy product of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing had sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at will be taken either oral ( infants and children who are not yet to swal@@ low , or patients with swal@@ low disorders ) or have given an Rhin@@ ens@@ onde .
after the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight above 20 kg and with adult @-@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ manipul@@ ate deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ate synthetic carbonate or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ c bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ y@@ lin or Ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ or , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ ap@@ utes were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active Met@@ abol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain .
a more likely reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old ano@@ re@@ tic patient who developed a metab@@ olic end@@ omet@@ ri@@ opath@@ y with lac@@ t@@ ach@@ i@@ et , serious hypo@@ kal@@ emia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripher@@ als of neu@@ ropath@@ y and panic .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to transfer excess of excess
based on the analysis of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine , patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of bias of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amin @-@ nitrogen are produced for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients another deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
during this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and a large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ine is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so that they don &apos;t have the sti@@ ck@@ ler waste material that can not take out after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have laboratory testing , you need to inform the doctor that you can use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
in taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drug .
while still life you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine might pass over to breast milk and harm to your baby .
in rare cases , lac@@ t@@ ness , heada@@ ches , taste disorders , im@@ pregn@@ ation of the hearing , des@@ ic dysfunction , and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ log@@ ically conditions were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , you can immediately use your doctor , or with the emergency absorption of your hospital for the purpose of treatment in conjunction with the treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar ) , for example in inst@@ ant@@ ine ang@@ ina ( heart attack ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with anxi@@ ety or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients enrolled at the main study of the treatment of ACS , with the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in a single gift or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine in relation to blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I compared .
while the PCI was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a clas@@ p ) , and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - with the preventing of new events ( deaths , heart failure or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year overall , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was exactly the same as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components .
it may also be applied in patients who had a blood pressure , as well as people with a strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in &apos;s treatment during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the market launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ant@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ bel ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in an emergency case or if early intervention is foreseen .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient &apos;s patient underwent a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI application , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consisting of one @-@ initial intraven@@ ous ri@@ fusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one to each subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt should be carried out of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicines before use is carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fu@@ sions dose is set correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate should be used from 1,4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , it is a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and once again test the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes according to the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .

patients are carefully used during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ding is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI patients , under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most of the blood cells occur in arter@@ ial points , patients who undergo a per@@ ic@@ ycle cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment of principle .
in patients who are waiting for the War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ding , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Standards ratio ) should be moved to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved prior to the treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ icia ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ers ) can be assumed that these substances should increase blood risk .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ cy@@ bo@@ ilers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ lob@@ st@@ ase@@ fire are regularly controlled in any case .
the experimental tests are insufficient in relation to the effects of the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ bound or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were randomised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were randomly assigned to either in@@ fac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in @-@ treated groups were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than with male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding entered significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ VA inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular blood pressure or blood pressure in the point sector , reducing the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known blood pressure , re@@ operation due to an bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alization that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in @-@ treated groups were more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than with male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding entered significantly less often than in the compar@@ ative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ation is immediately breaking off and to monitor the patient with regard to the signs of blood .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ one , which bin@@ ds both at the cat@@ aly@@ tic centre as well as at the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ bin@@ ation region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or to ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ an in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ wap the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , allowing the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
Moreover , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients , in which it had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ tive thes@@ es / he@@ par@@ in@@ ized thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no thro@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ate reaction .
in healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in shows a dos@@ ing and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is assigned by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the patient following a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us should be given by 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in and increases the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY trial was administered in@@ fac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin , according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or either before the start of the angi@@ om@@ ization or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk factors , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is injected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , injected thigh or upper arm or is administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease which does not produce sufficient insulin in the blood of glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is not effective .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very mar@@ gin@@ ally of human resources , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter effect time has as a short @-@ effective human error .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in use in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin @-@ type insulin @-@ diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
at type 2 diabetes where the insulin is not effective in effect , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the substance gly@@ cer@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found in comparison to a reduction of 0.14 % at insulin delivery per year .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal standard .
A@@ pi@@ dra cannot be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , either in the area of abdom@@ inal ceiling , the thigh or the delay angle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous via continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal .
due to the reduced Glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and lower insulin change , the insulin need for patients with a limitation on the liver function can be lowered .
each change of the effectiveness , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ P@@ H , z@@ zinc delay etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move the insulin demand .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or the demol@@ ition of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ ul@@ ant diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ it@@ ator ; this states are potentially life threat@@ ening .
the conversion of a patient on an additional insulin number or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may be necessary to change the dosage .
the time of tre@@ ach@@ ments of mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment schem@@ atic .
to increase the substances that increase the blood glucose activity and rein@@ force the t@@ ilt of mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ums , anti@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) Hem@@ mer , pent@@ ox@@ et@@ yl@@ line , Mon@@ o@@ amin @-@ oxid@@ ants , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of symptoms of sympath@@ y , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserve the symptoms of ad@@ re@@ side anti@@ gen , be weakened or missing .
animal experiments for re@@ productive studies showed no differences between in@@ su@@ peri@@ ors and human beings in relation to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ les occurs in the human breast milk , but in general , insulin usually occurs in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ating after or@@ ally .
here are listed below clinical studies that are listed in clinical studies ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the real ba@@ iting data not be rated ) .
cold - silent , cool and blu@@ ff skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ ach@@ ments , fear , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , benefit of vision , heada@@ che , nau@@ sea and heart knock .
in the wake of the injection system , Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ atro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy occurred at the injection site .
severe mort@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des with consciousness can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
according to a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the urine and avoid similar episodes for the serious mort@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose levels ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ u@@ be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em standard .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ act@@ us , insulin delivery in a therapeutic glu@@ ing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in the glu@@ ing effect , and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glu@@ ing effect , exactly as human beings .
insulin l@@ is@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast activity entry like normal human beings and achieves the complete glu@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human beings .
the data was evident in case of an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ ins in 2 minutes before meal , a similar post@@ eri@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , like with a humane standard , which is given 30 minutes before meals .
in 2 minutes before meal was ge@@ ared , a better post@@ eri@@ di@@ al control was given as a human@@ em normal , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin delivery is applied within 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as with human normal standard , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human@@ em standard , which has been given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1B ) .
at the beginning of the meal in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after onset of the meal in comparison with humane Nor@@ - mal@@ nutrition , 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1C ) was given .
