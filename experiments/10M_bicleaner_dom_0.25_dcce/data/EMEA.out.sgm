<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public transportation report (EPAR), which will be explained as the committee for human health agent (CHMP) in order to be implemented in order to supply recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please read the check-in (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendation of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve itself in the mouth), as a solution for inclusion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. host thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), Misstrust and madness; • bipolar disease, a psychic illness, in which the patient manic episodes (periods of oral mood) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe physical episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have spoken in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders, if the oral dosage of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution for inclusion or the melting of tablets can be applied in patients with the hatches of tablets trouble.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are using other medicines that are equal to the cilify, the dose should be adapted to abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impaired the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter", i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of neurons each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ariadmirzol presumably works primarily as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripianzol is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lower degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripizzol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and it will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, the re-act of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared to two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was conducted over twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to avoid reacts, to 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of abilify injection solution was observed in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which compared to germinted unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another anti-psychological) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale of bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tray and the solution for dispossling (receiveth).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients showed that the cilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms that received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms was more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the revival of manic episodes for up to 74 weeks in pre-treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more efficient than placebo increased accidents and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify for inclusion (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), temporal secretion (increased alibris), tichelating hypersecretion (increased salice production), fatigue and exhaustion, restrained blood, insombre (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of abilify in treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to serious manic episodes in patients who had mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripianzol spoke, compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the result that the advantages of injections in rapid control of severe accidents and behavioural disturbances in patients with manpolar episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a licence for placing on the market of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of heavy until serious mantic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode of patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripianzol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day during a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of these patient groups a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripianzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of addictive behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affection disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripianzol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of cancer by Aripianzol, compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be treated with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, oversight disorders, conditions that are used for hypotonia (dehydration, hyptins, treatment with blood pressure tumors) or hypertonie (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyes Silesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there was occasional reports about the treatment with Aripianzol aufenberger.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients were treated with ABILIFY, patients and symptoms of a late dymis should occur, should be dragged to reduce the dose or break treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient who develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotica, including ABILIFY, are to be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripizzol should be used in patients with crampons in the anamnesis or for states that are related with crampings in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripizzol in patients with psyringes associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripianzol were treated, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosages and the announcing for unwanted events with Aripianzol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases also extremely and associated with Ketoazione or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypic antipsychotic drug, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypic antipsychotic drug patients treated to direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagia and sponges are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with respect to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenen patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, which is known as antipsychotics in which weight gain as a side effect, and might cause severe complications, and might lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is careful when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centralised medicines such as Sedation is taken (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripianzol, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripianzol by 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetin and paroxetin, similar effects, and therefore similar to similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisiers. the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripianzol resulting in comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift from Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential use of potential risks in patients should prevail.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly efficient inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dostions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosing of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diabetic or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a stable increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripieczol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be given to alert their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripianzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of insufficient data base on the safety of people and due to the inproductive studies during the animal studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines including strength vehicles, including strength vehicles, until they are certain that Aripianzol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequencies listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripianzol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dysteine and Dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripivotzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients treated with Aripianzol and 15.1% in patients under Olanced in therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was in patients with arithmetic treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients under Aripivotzol treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with arithmetic treatment and 15,7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripianzol and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, there was no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">The CPK (creatine Phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripianzol patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic syndrome, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dynasty events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or undeliberate overdose associated with Aripianzol alone were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">In fact, no information on the effectiveness of a hemoralysis in the treatment of an overdose associated with Aripianzol; it is however unlikely that hemoralysis in the treatment of an overdose of use is, since Aripizzol has a high plasma arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripianzol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disruption about the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1meric receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripizozol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1 receptor and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripianzol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dosing dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor lign, at Nucleus caudatas and on the putties.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1.228 consecutive patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study, 52 out of the response of response to study diseases was similar in both groups (Aripianzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring values, which were defined as secondary data purposes, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was at 34% in the Aripivotzol Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanced in-controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in the primary study of weight loss, a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a mantic or mixed episode of bipolar I error, Aripianzol showed an effect on placebo improved in reducing the symptoms of 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a mantic or mixed episode of bipolar-I error, Ariadmirzol showed no superior effect on placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monootherapy over 12 weeks in patients with a mantic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripizzol showed an effect on placebo improved in week 3 and a maintenance effect which was comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripizozol also proved a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features that partially reflect on Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy in some cases, the accompanying therapy with Aripianzol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing the symptoms in comparison to Monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10. in a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks followed by a long-time expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved a remission during a stabilisation phase in front of Randomization in comparison to the prevention of a bipolar returns, mainly during the prevention of a return in the Manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion of Aripianzol, the N-Dealchipper is catalyst by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elioration time of approximately 75 hours for Aripizzol is located at approximately 75 hours for Aripizzol, with an intensive metabolisers over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisiers. on CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripianzol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in an pharmacokical examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific analysis for Pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in respect to ethnic origin or the impact of space on the Pharmacokinetics of Aripianzol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokical characteristics of Aripianzol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure, compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study with volunteers with different trenching of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripianzol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to pull battles on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in retreated gift, reproductive oxicity, genotoxicity and to canvative potential, the preclinical data do not recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or expositions that clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects covered a dosing-dependent secondary toxicity and / or parenchyma cell loss) with rats at least 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the average maximum dose when people) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the average maximum dose when people at the recommended maximum dose when people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was found as a result of eradication of sulphate-conjugates of Aripianzol in the Gall of monkeys after repetitive administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- until 3fold the middle class dose or the 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose when people is based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the concentrations at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were found at the sulphate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripizzol no more than 6% of the concentrations that have been detected in the Galle of Monkeys in the study (6%) in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of the 3- and 11fold in the middle class of jady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic Mamymcarcinoma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal clinical Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most remarkable vital toxicity of toxicity (79% of patients reported) and was quick reversible and dosing; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with abrava in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the gift of Abraxane as Monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactinghydrogenase in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood, reduced potassium in blood:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyoagie, breaches, drills, dry mouth, bitter chair, oil sophagitis, pain in the mouth, oral pain, recurrenal blood disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the breastplate, weakness of musculature, genious pain, muscular pain, pain in the skeletal musculature, flank pains in the breakdown, muscular weaknesses Very frequently:</seg>
<seg id="300">Guarantee 1 The frequency of the transition effects is calculated based on a definitively in the case of a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no significant connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtated active ingredient that supports the coupling of the microtubules from the tuberindices and stabilized the microtubuli through inhibition of its deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubular network that is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transzytose is conveyed into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of Albums promotes the transportation of Paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60 albuminor, and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (and ted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for mating Mammakaroma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-air-blind studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic mamocarcinoma treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mamocarcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic Mammcarcinoma, either in the form of solvent-resistant Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 hour infusion with the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">At the recording in the study, 64% of patients had an impotous general state (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 Metastasestamps.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of Metastasification and 19% due to Metastasification and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general contact rate and time until the progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived at a time during therapy at a periodic re-ropathy grade 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripherals of neuropathy on bsound to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Pharmacokinetics of the total Paclitaxel after 30- and 180 minutes infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active section (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to an intravenous gift of Abraxane in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration increased to multiphatic way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a wide extravagcular distribution and / or softness connection of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced tumors, the pharmacokical characteristics of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared with an 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent-resistant Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift higher (43%) than after a solvent-resistant Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue-coated, Paclitaxel is primarily reported to 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic mamocarcinoma, the total annual dose generated with less than 1% of Metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel, which has a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, more than 75 years of age, however, only few data are available, since only 3 patients in this age group participated in pharmacokinetical analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to an organic pharmacist, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference tenant").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels that could occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood circulation is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician, having experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own hemorrhage, Abseamed is to inject to a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be made by the patient or coaches of care, provided that they have an appropriate guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy alone, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per month for adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be used before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and an iron supplement should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy alone or in patients with kidney problems, a anomalmic may be caused by a erythropoietinmangel or that the body does not sufferase the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of epoxetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was used as a injection in a vein within the framework of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered caused by kidney problems compared to reference tenant.</seg>
<seg id="370">All in this study patients had been injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were transferred either to Abseamed or to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">Moreover, the Company also presented the results of a study in which the effects were examined by Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were deported to Abseamed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continue to Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continue to continue Eprex / Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, irritating-like headache and lactness.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against epoxalfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems, because further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">Finally, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the drug has been achieved in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, dedicated to Abseamed, will provide information on medical specialists in all the Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG a licence for placing on the market of abstreamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of emulation and reduction in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphoma or multiplem Myeloma who received chemotherapy and with which the risk of a transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anomalies (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiencies are not available or insufficient, in case of planned major operating income (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For a reduction in foreign blut, Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopedic intervention in adults without iron deficiencies where a high risk of transfusion complications is expected to be expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where hemoglobin concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Attacks and follictions can be different depending on the age, gender and total disease last; therefore the assessment of individual clinical course and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in the hemoglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients can occasionally be observed in a patient individual hemoglobin values or below the hemoglobin concentration concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the lasting hemoglobin value is 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">The patient should be monitored in order to ensure that Epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for checks of anemia and the anus-ymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses as a patient where the initial anomalies is less heavy (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses as a patient where the initial anomalies is less heavy (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose: 50 / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 / kg (three times per week), until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anämiesymptome and - following releases can be different depending on the age, gender and total disease last; therefore the assessment of individual clinical course and disease resistance is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of these hemoglobin variability, the hemoglobin target should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">The patient should be monitored in order to ensure that Epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the parabocttome.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticuline number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value, the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Reticuline number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has risen from the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 / kg three times a week of hemoglobin value to ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticuline number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be retained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">In contrast, the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retifier numbers increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the output value, a response to the epoxalfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with light anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the pre-reaching deposit of ≥ 4 blood-condenses should be charged twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operating procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">With the iron substitution, as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of autologous blood donor program - we will be able to stand large iron reserves before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 g / kg epetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and on the day of the surgery (Day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">This should be preoperatively preoperative 300 / kg at a period of 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery, and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a Fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients receiving treatment with some erythropoetin at a erythropolastopenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not get ill or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroroblastopenia).</seg>

<seg id="411">In patients with sudden effect, the reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month), should be determined with high demand for failure (ice, folacid or vitamin B12 deficiency, infections or infections, blood loss and hemorolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulozytends value is normal (i.e. the Retikuloid "Index"), which is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / Mikroliter or &lt; 0,5%), the throcythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marks for diagnosis of a PRCA should appear.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use in patients with a risk of anti-induced PRCA (patients with renal anomalies) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic kidney failure, the threshold limit of the hemoglobin-target concentration should not be exceeded in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular disease were observed if erythropoesis stimulating substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefits that is due to the gift of epoxins, when the hemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration of anthromites and avoiding blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically insufficiency or dust-insufficiency should not be exceeded, in maintenance therapy, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to this knowledge, the treatment of anomalies with epages in adults with kidney failure, which are not dialyased in dialytic insufficiency, do not accelerate the progression of kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">With tumour patients receiving chemotherapy patients, a 2-3-week delay between epetin-alfa gift and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may not be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize adverse events in accordance with Section 4.2 (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic agent - dose for 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for application recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment under participation in the respective patients, which should also consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger electrified orthopedic procedure, if possible, at the beginning of the epoxy-alfa therapy, the cause of anemia was investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger electrified orthopedic procedure should have an appropriate Thromboseprophylaxis, because they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with an initial cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded that for treatment with epetin alfa for patients with a starting dose of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>

<seg id="428">If epicin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, blood cholesterol level should be monitored by Ciclosporin and the Ciclospork should be adjusted to increasing hematokrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies of tumor tissues, there are no indications in the interaction between epetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF for ugatological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, arterial Thrombs, arterial Thrombs, Aneurysmen, Retinalthrombs and 11 blood cots in artificial kidneys, was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, so also patients under epthropoetine treatment.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common adverse effect during treatment with epetin alfa is a dosing dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertonie.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Irrespective of erythropoetin treatment, it can be repeated in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donating to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledronym concentration by 30% at the end of infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmaconcentrate against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance from cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because Zoledronic acid does not metabolic for humans and because they are not a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronic correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal disturbance down to a creatinin Clearance to 35 ml / min requires no dosing adaptation of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are only restricted data for severe kidney failure (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), there are no statements for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-treated intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks (a cumulative dose containing the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure, relative to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application at cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects appeared at other bodies, including the gastrointestinal traction and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), where metformin (in particular overweight patients) can not be displayed, where metformin (a diabetic medication) can be applied.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphate resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphate resin or insulin may be maintained, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of the sulphate resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin may be better utilised and the blood sugar level reduces, so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in Triplex therapy was examined; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphate resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in blood (glycerylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured that indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to reduce blood glucose levels when applying the dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Triplex study, the effect of an additional charge of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphate resin in a lowering of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, the patients who participated in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who participated in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract (pathoys), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients who may possibly be very sensitive to Pioglitazone or one of the other elements, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoittizer (high casserole, acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients when metformin is not indicated in case of metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited issued an approval for placing on account of Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient in inadequate and in which metformations is unsuitable due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">To use Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are due to the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">The patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced carcinogenic reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and oil if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome Study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase of reports of congestive heart failure showed, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with enhanced output liver values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">When ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms developed that point to an ectical erectile dysfunction, such as impassumpy nausea, vomiting, tortoelessness and / or darker Harn, are the liver values to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be continued until the launch of the laboratory parameters should be led by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosing-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be absorbed by fat deposits and in some cases linked to the fluid.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a Häoglitazone, a slight reduction in central hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobins about 3.6-4.1%) and at a lower extent also in patients under sulphuryllenica and insulin (relative reduction in hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematokrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients, the Pioglitazone is regarded as oral and triple-combination therapy with a sulphate resin or as a dual-technical combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosing-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the treatment with thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the consumption of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema; however, physicians will be aware of the possibility of a macular edema if patients are disruptions of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic statement should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events for bone quarries from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures for 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone patients who compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient asks for a pregnancy or this entry, the treatment is aborted (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenomoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medication which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptiva, Cyclosporin, calcium sheer and HMGCoA reducers are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibroz (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction in AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the insulin-resistant insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the lens and the refractive index of the lens that can be observed in other hypoglycemic drug.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents occurred over the three times the upper limit of the normality as often as placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylresin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced maacrovascular disease the frequency of a heavy heart failure was diagnosed with Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has been rarely reported on heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was compiled a summarized analysis of messages undesixed, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative treatment groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the period over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">With taking a maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on an activation of specific core receptic acid (PPAR-130), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscular cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been inadequate, despite three months of optimisation, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue only insulin; a reduction in insulin was observed with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials above a year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albums in / Kreatinin-Quotifers in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus Plazebo) was tested in a small, fixed examination of type 2 diabetics at 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials comparing to placebo a reduction in the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as marginally, but clinically significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the overall plasma glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels below Pioglitazone, while under metformin and Gliclazid reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the posteridial increased triglyceride levels, this both about a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the vast Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive Study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orally use, Pioglitazone is quickly resorated, with the top concreations of unchanging Pioglitazone in plasma, usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This base corresponds to the contribution of M-IV for efficacy in about the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, Phenomoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to a general use of radioactive markedly Pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the lower (55%) and a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchangeable Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and that of the total active Metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its Metabolites are lower than in patients with reduced renal function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxic studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agree with a repetitive administration of Plasmavolume augmentation with hemlution, anemia and reversible exhilic heart hypertropics.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, the insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), inhibiting of hyperplums (with male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the urinary epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familial ocular polyposis (FAP) treatment with two other thiazolidindions lead to an elevated frequency of colonists.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures for 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone patients who compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study on two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclacid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials above 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in Albums in / Kreatinin-Quotifers in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postoperative triglyceride levels, this both about a effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as on the heyglyceride absorption as well.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing on their primary endpoint, a combination of non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke amputation of the leg, coronized Revascularisation and Revascularisation of leg arteries, put the results that are not connected with the intake of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one page the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarized analysis of messages unwanted events, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients treated with Pioglitazone and showed a increased incidence of bones in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone patients who compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the sober triglycerides, but also improved the posterior enhanced triglyceride mirror, this both about a effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as on the heytriglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was found in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycol) hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, pointing out that the blood sugar levels were similar to the same as with other human beings.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) on human RPE cells or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of acetphane may be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can result in blood sugar (the full list is to be found).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acetphane at the treatment of diabetes compared to risks compared to the risk of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S for placing on the market of action of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily, if a fast initial effect together with a longer lasting effects will be desired.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose adjustment has significantly improved, for example, in particular, the hypoglycemic warning message can be perceived and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any changes as regards strength, mark (manufacturer), insulin type (fast vertebrates, non-insulin or insulin delivery) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA versus insulin of animal origin) can result in that a change of dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If using Actraphane in the patient an dosing adaptation is required, it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients where hypoglycemic reactions came up after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or differently than in their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travel that go over several time zones, the patient should be noted to obtain the advice of his physician, as such travels have to be applied, that insulin and meals must be applied to other times.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-valley levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, dosing adaptation, changes of immune soup, or by simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As the agraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the steady State is entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the valley level does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on the penguing of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect dimensions were the changes in the severity of the hypocrispensnymptome which was reported by the patient prior to the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients receiving their symptoms all 12 hours in a diary and evaluated by a standard scale as heavily the symptoms in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrispensnymptome, the patients reported in Aeropaze had a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who had pseudoepheatment alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed an increase of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who lost the desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aeropaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachments, swelling, psychic hyperactivity (pharyngevity), hippie (appetite), hippie, fatigue, Insomnie (insomnia), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">In patients who may not be sensitive to desloratadin, pseudoepheatin, pseudoepheatin or one of the other components, against adrety active ingredients or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>

<seg id="1671">After the decline of sill-skins in the upper respiratory system, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze pseudoepheels contains, the drug is also contra-indexed in patients treated with a Monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetry activity in combinated application of pseudoepheaders, Pergolid, Lisurydroplotamine or other deconcology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, epheaders, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient's disease and do not submit the data to arrange corresponding recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and effectiveness of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit their data to arrange corresponding recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients need to be informed that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or speedometer, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of headaches) must be informed.</seg>

<seg id="1694">In both studies, histaminantagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined using the overall interest for the symptoms (except nose grind cheese) significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoepheels over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined using the nasal grind cheese, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study on the Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the Peruvian application of Aerinaze at healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoepheatine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokainetd study, which was conducted with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were badly affected.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components interact study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoepheatcan be organic equivalent to the exposure of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on security systems, toxicity in retreated gift, for genotoxicity and reproductive cleaners, the preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot recognize any special hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredients pseudoepheels.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoepheels was in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogen.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed to the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) that the company takes its application for the placing on the market of Aflunov to the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people for protection against influenza, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine, which may cause a tribe of the Grippevirus which might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of the Grippevirus is diving, which can easily spread a human being, because people don't have immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the Grippevirus as a "body-foreign" and forming antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a Grippevirus of this genealogy.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the diaphragm surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-foreign), is cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient to comply with the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you need to participate in a clinical study and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor's treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you want more information regarding the basis of the recommendation of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, with the humane immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1) which caused the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution for inclusion, but this can not be taken together with Ritonavir because the security of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be imposed if the physician investigates which antiviral drugs in the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus continues to speak on the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase is reduced in combination with other antiviral drugs the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not want to heal AIDS, however, the damage of the immune system and the development of AIDS infections and diseases can also appear.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This medicinal anti-induced Ritonavir increased medicine Agenase was compared with 206 adults who had previously used protease inhibitor compared to other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (Virusload) or the change in the virusload after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had no protease inhibitor had had a viral load of more than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo but Agenase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the virusload, but with the children who were treated earlier with protease inhibitors only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, which had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the anti-avir increased medicine Agenase, as effective after 16-week treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came under Agenera along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who had their existing protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (distray), opulence (nausea), vomiting, rash, and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase can not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against Amperavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase can also not be applied to patients who are being mined (a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, that are the same as Agenase and are in high concentrations in the blood of health-harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, Agenase is taking the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in distribution of body fat), an osteonapse (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immunoactivating syndroms (symptoms of infection which caused by the recovered immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">Finally, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is generally taken together with the pharmacokinetcal amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the use of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had no protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "extraordinary circumstances" as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information templates.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission donated the Glaxo Group to submit an approval for the market launch of Agenase in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokainetical Boostereal Booksavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amcavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amdetavir as a solution for inclusion is 14% less than one capsule. therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligrams per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1946">Since the aggregates of the HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitor inhibitor of CYP3A4 is dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous use of Loveyee and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenottoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under surveillance of the International Standards ratios), methods are available for determining the concentration concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenase may be less effective because of reduced plasma brick (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amperavir the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva may be changed, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>

<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with heavy immune effect, a inflammatory reaction on asymptomatic or residuale opportunist infections can develop, which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immune soup), cases of osteonecrose especially in patients with advanced HIV-condition and / or long-term application of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic latitude cannot be given simultaneously with medication which have a low therapeutic width and also substrates substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width of astase with Ritonavir cannot be combined with medication, whose active ingredients are primarily connected to CYP2D6 and connected to the increased plasma image with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% decrease in the AUC of Amperavir, which can lead to a virologic failure and to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lowest plasma brick by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often undesirable effects of the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Currant (hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amperavir can be lower with the simultaneous use of plant preparations with curisweeds (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already assumes currant, the amplitudes mirror and if possible, to verify the virusload and add the curisweeds.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose customization for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelly avir is given together with Amcavir (see also Efaviest below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amperavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Amperavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which demonstrate the effectiveness and disability of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amperavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amperavir (600 mg twice daily) reached with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amdetavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but it is recommended not to be a close monitoring since the effectiveness and disadvantage of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In combination with didanosin combination with didanosin combination, it is recommended that it is recommended to meet distraosin combination with didanosin that the revenue of didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, at the gift of Efaviest in combination with Amperavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efaviest in combination with amperavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and available limited data can be discouraged that Nevirapin possibly lowers the serum concentration of Amperavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medicine should be used simultaneously, be careful because Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma tiles even less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are used together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virologic surveillance should be made, because an accurate forecast of the combination of amperavir and Ritonavir is difficult to be found on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amperavir and Rikerutin led to an increase in Plasmajeation (AUC) of Rikerutin at 193%, and thereby resulting in an increase in related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Ridenutin along with Awase is recommended to reduce the dosage of Rikerutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetcal studies with astase in combination with erythroromycin were not performed, but the plasma asptiles of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamaavior with 200 mg Ketoconazol once daily lead to 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole a day without simultaneous use of Fosamperavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be used in common with Agenase, possibly result in interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions, which are monitored by these medication, if they are used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as Agenase, as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-vulsiva, which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobservers al, Carbamazepin), with Amperavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma brick.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium blockers such as Amlodipin, diverazem, Felodipin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nipppin, Ninsdipin and Verapamil may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of Agenase can considerably increase their plasma concentrates, including PDE5 inhibitors in associated side effects including hypotence, visual acuity and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluorticasonpropionat plasranasal (4 times a day), while the endogenous Kortisol declined by about 86% (90% decrease interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenase with Ritonavir is not recommended in collaboration with these glucose concentrations, unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic correlated effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which is dependent on CYP3A4, distinctive narrates of the plasma torque has been expected to be expected by Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma increases of this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to Myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, since the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased to the same time as Amperavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase cannot be used along with oral care of the oral disease (see Section 4.3), while using Agenase with parenteral care is offered as caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parted Midazolamide with other protections indicate a possible rise in the plasma cutting of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-Fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered together with Amdetavir, patients should therefore be monitored to Opiatentric ymptome, especially if even low doses of Ritonavir should be given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of its low reliability of historical verbs, no recommendation can be given at present, like the Amperavir- dose is given if Amperavir is given at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous extraction of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase, an increased control of the INR (International normalised ratios) is recommended for the possibility of a attenuation or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptiva is not predictable, therefore alternative ways are recommended to conception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful surveillance of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in the early age of Agenase (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2003">Impurality of Agenase was investigated in adults and children over 4 years in clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the associated side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were slightly up to moderate, rose early and led to the treatment breakaway.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether in connection with the intake of Agenase or another at the same time, whether they are applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the disease.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance systems, Genotypical interpretations can be used to estimate the activity of Amberavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamperavir / Ritonavir defined as the presence of mutations V32F / I, L33F, I84V and L90M, I84V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an uprotypical resistance on Fosamperavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to changes through additional data, and it is recommended to attract the current interpretational systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phatic resistance classification, clinically valid phenotypical interpretations can be used in conjunction with genotypical data to the assessment of the activity of Amberavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies such as diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV that can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity against amitavir associated genetic pattern creates a certain crucifixion against Ritonavir, the sensitivity of Indinavir, Nelly avir and Saquinavir remained generally in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the crucifixion between Amberavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamperavir resistors, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>

<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amperavir retains its activity against some other protease-resistive insulating insist; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early release of a reconcile therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries pertaining to the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with the lowest Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with retrospeculated virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the virusload (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unborn Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution was used to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low ditonavir was given at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) together with Agenerase administered NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared with the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After administration is the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amperavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amperavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amcavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amdetavir 12 hours after the dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Hence the minimum concentration in the jady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Amperavir from the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in the plasma, with the amount of uncompressed Amcavir, which represents the active proportion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unpuffed amplitudes remained constant, the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing process, depending on the aggregates concentration in the jady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore medicines that inducing CYP3A4 induce or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4 should be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The prevalence of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amcavir exposure like an adult dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amperavir is made of the solution 14% less bioavailable as of the capsules; therefore, Agenase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the impact of a renal disturbance on the elimination of amperavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Amcavir-Plasmask similar to those who are generated with healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amperavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on mice with amperavir on mice and rats, in case of male animals, heathocular Adenome with doses of exposure to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- fold (rat) of the people, after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg of Amberavir.</seg>

<seg id="2057">From the present exchanges data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic use, however, somewhat more information for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, bacterial cell lymphoma test, microorescence test on rats and chromosome test to human peripheral lymphocytes, was Amperavir neither mutations nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life through measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenase, nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity at young, treated from a age of 4 days, showed both at the control as well as with Amdetavir treated animals a high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma volume, which was significantly less (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage of humans, however, a number of slight changes, including thymuselongation and minor skeletal changes are observed, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24. if Agenase capsules can be applied without the amplifying supplement of Ritonavir (Booster), higher doses should be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Amperavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amberavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous use should be carried out in patients with low or lighter liver working with caution, in patients with severe liver failure, it is contra-indexed (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or for a period of ≤ 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod-cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest medicine concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applying in the face (12.5 mg, 1 one bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-time span was about 10 times higher than the 2hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates the extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data to systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of age and comparable with healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superfixed basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month trial laying down toxicity at ramps carried out doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg. kg of weight down to significantly reduced weight and increased lacz weight; one also resulted in a similar effects for four months in the mouse there was no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on the carcinogenicity of mice in mice on three days a week does not induced tumors at the application point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but because Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and is not dirty, the risk of people because of systematic exposure is very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free cream, previously and in a greater number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, but it was also measured its effectiveness (in relation to the reduction of the gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated).</seg>
<seg id="2278">At the age of five, Aldurazyme decreased the gag concentrations in the urine at about 60% and half of the treated children demonstrated at the end of the study a normal big liver.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and mixing frost.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be very sensitive to patients who may not react strongly (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Mediceries Agency (EMEA) will be able to check all new information which may be well-known, and this is to be updated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who observe aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued the Genzyme Europe B.V. a licence for the placing on the market of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of humanities α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammals (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative for patients with a secured diagnosis of a Muerysaccharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iestonidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial Infusions rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is carrying out all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been established, and for these patients no dosing regimen can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing regimen can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusive reactions that are defined as any other side effects, which occur during infusion or until the end of the fusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be monitored in close meshed, and infusion of Aldurazyme should be done only in a reasonable clinical environment, in revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase form, usually within 3 months from the treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusive reaction must be treated with care by Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, there must be careful risk reaction due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (Antihistopathic and / or anti-pyorka) to minimize the potential appearance of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with Antihistopathic and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be erased and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half of the infusion rate where the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single heavy infusion reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are to be decreased, a treatment with Antihistopathic and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate where the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (Antihistopathic and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate where the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies are not allowed to close direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exposed to Laronidase via the breast milk, it is recommended to take care during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse reactions in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusions related to 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment time of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medication changes in connection with Aldurazyme which were observed during the period of 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are often listed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 100); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with heavier MPS-I-related involvement of the upper breaths and lungs, in addition, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasmus, brewing and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted medication effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly heavy intermittent form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment to a seroconversion, whereby the patients at the age of 5 came to a seroconia (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early departure from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not reported by Radioimmune resolutions (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies before, among them 3 patients, where it was never too seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacked under low anti-body mirror showed a robust reduction in the gag mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of gag in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginale until low-neutralising effect on the enzyme activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduce the reduction of gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse drug actions, even if the occurrence of adverse medicines are typically used with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the preventing of further accumulation adequate restoration of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After an intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly absorbed from the circulation and of cells into the Lysosomes, most likely of manosis-6 phosphatts receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients ranged from the central phenotype, and only one patient had the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an expirated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme had an improvement of lung function and the ability to see which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in deralpacyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage of prospective FEV is not significantly reduced over this period of clinical and absolute lung-volumes increased proportional to the height-growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomic fact before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of Gag-Spiegel was detected in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) that remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In regard to the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients who are using a combined end point, clinically significant changes in five-minute walk, motion range of the shoulder joint Ahi and visual acuity, was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and Pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients who were studied at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy interrun form and 4 with the medium run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirrors per week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium volume form, whereas in case of the older patients with severe failure rate, limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations to alco-dynamic effects of different Aldurazyme-metering schemes were performed on the Gag-Mirrors in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent any adverse alternative in patients who represent difficulties with weekly infusions, but it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equal.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information which will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medication will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokical profile in patients aged under 5 years of age was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on security systems, toxicity at a time gift, toxicity in recurrent gift and reproductions, the preclinical data do not allow any special hazards for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2355">Alimta is treated with patients who had previously not been treated, in combination with Cisplatin and in patients who had previously used other chemotherapies as sole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce adverse events, patients with Alimta should receive a Corticosteroid as well as folic acid (vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with Cisplatin, a "anti-label" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent inflammatory defects) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood cells changes, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be applied, set or reduced the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetreeds thus slowed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetreeds in its active form goes easier to outfit in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medication and a longer active duration of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant Pleuramesotheliome, Alimta was examined in a major study involving 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">The effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease have been treated with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (an other medicines for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta has also been compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), and both in combination with Cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously obtained non-chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived on average 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared with docetaxel when compared to 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients suffering from cancer-epithelium cells were observed in both studies, with the administration of Alimta for longer survival compared with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a licence for the placing on the market of Alimta in the whole European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study with alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with more relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common adverse events (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are codious spots on after, fleatus (winds) with chair labeling, chair ldurge, fetal vertebra (rotting), Flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (for preventing transplanting patients) or with medication such as Warfarin for preventing blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also be applied in patients who are absorbed in a long-term malabsorptive syndrome (if not enough nutrients are taken out of the digestive tract) or to cholestase (liver disease), and with pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indexed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight (body measure index ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypocalory, fat-induced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli cannot be used by children and adolescents under 18 because not enough data to the effectiveness and security are given.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since Orlistat is only minimally resorated, the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function is not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of trestence of astrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken with a rich single meal or a rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control, patients who consult a medicine against diabetes prior to the beginning of therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist, because the dose of anti-diabetics must be adjusted separately.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for hypertension or an increased cholesterol level should be asked if your doctor or pharmacist should be adapted to whether the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to prevent additional fluctuating courses, in order to prevent severe diarrhoea possible failure of oral contrasts (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on the interactions of medication as well as in several cases with the same application of orlistat and Ciclosporin was observed a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma tiles.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In combination with orlistat or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick Values (internationally standardised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients that were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as the beta carotene in the standard range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin preparate before bedtime to ensure a sufficient vitamine intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiorecon was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers that received orlistat, a slight decrease in the Amiorecon plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effect of the medication, because the absorption of one approved fat is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The number of people are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), but not known (frequency on the basis of the available data estimates).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of those notable side effects, which were determined after the market launch by Orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population unaware size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plaught that the treatment with alli can lead to defending on possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Individual doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given to normal and overweight subjects, without any significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported on the market release of orlistat-overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research and animals, a systematic formation of systematic effects, which are attributable to lifelstat properties of orlistat, can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect lies in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by kovalente to the active Serin-rest of the gastratic and pancreatic lipassions.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg of orlistat is taken three times daily, the absorption of approximately 25% of the food-fetts have been blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 provides effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with hypocalory, fat-induced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameters, variation of body weight compared with the initial value (at the time of Randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of course (Table 1) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">In both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol amounted to 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3,8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with Orlistat 60 mg (output value of 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of not metabisised orlistat had not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, the therapeutic doses of metablistat could not be detected in plasma and in extreme low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without a sign of cumulation.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), and chemotherapies for nausea and vomiting are (as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antibodies).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, since the effects in this age group do not be enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient has the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to prevent the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">For chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients who had been treated with Aloxi was not vomiting (132 from 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients who had been treated with Aloxi was no vomiting (153 by 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">By comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission announced the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the market launch of Aloxi in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetoing chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetoing chemotherapy due to cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi becomes the prevention of nausea and vomiting that induced by a strong emetoed chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a corticosteroids before using one prior to the chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon mpassage, patients with amnesty laws or signs of subacute icleus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful when treating palonosetron with medication which extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or that incline to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi is to be used in the days after chemotherapy, nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials, Palonosetron did not inspect the activity of the five investigated chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cymbabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacological interaction between one single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a cady concentration of metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharma-based pharma analysis, CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Dexamethics and Rifampicin), Cimetidin, Cimetidin, dooxetin, anodionavir, anodionavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies don't lie before, therefore palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is necessary to be considered by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most frequently observed in a dose of 250 micrograms to mean side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least probably stood with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obligation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of persuasion and reactions to the site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar breeds of adverse events showed themselves similar in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of action to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy at a Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg. of ondansetron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously to Day 1 without Dexamethasila.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetoed chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, and Dacarbazine, as well as 250 or 750 microgram palonosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg of Ondansetron, were assigned to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies involving moderate emetoing chemotherapy and the study with strong emetoing chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were similar to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the study of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the Ionic and Repolarisation of the Ionenkanals to extend the duration of the action schedule.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers were the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration of the body with an average terminal time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration of concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionately in the entire dose range from 0.3- 90 m / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to an intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was the average of 11 adult carcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacoketical simulations, that at once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), which was comparable to the time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg, however, the Cmax was higher after the use of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on Metabolization have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower dimensions, which are involved in the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron, regarded as unchangeable active substance, made around 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolt to treat, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver failure are increasing the terminal eliminations and average systematic exposition with pallonosetron, a reduction in the dose is however non-justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate above the maximum humane exposure to the clinical use, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 The clinical studies showed evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionenkanals, which are involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation and proliferation of action times.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose is given in about the 30st of the therapeutic exposure of humans), led to a multiple frequency of liver tumors, endoculine neoplasmen (in Thyroid, pancreas, pancreerenmark) and skin tumors at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not entirely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended for a one-time application, the relevance of these results will be assessed as a result for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holder of the approval for placing on the market must be informed about the plans for placing on the market as part of this decision approved in the context of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) adopted a negative test in which the authorization of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C treatment is recommended to be 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon an organic pharmacist named Roferon-A with the same inactive ingredient should be similar to that which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference tenant").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (one through a viral infection) of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In case of a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage indicates, also the values of the liver enzyme AlanyAminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon laid data that indicate the comparison of alpheon with roferon-A (active ingredients, composition, and purity of medicines, effects, security and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of reference tends to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study NSC 631570 was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed by the fact that data on the stability of the drug and the drug regimes were not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retardant to reduce the disease in more patients than in the reference case; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test was used to investigate a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with a crucifixion of passing skin infection) and small ininfected Lazerations (Rissor kerf), depreciation and sewn wounds applied.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillinresistente Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo does not affect this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface area should not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should reexamine the patient and draw alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle, which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was observed in all five studies of the patients whose infection was speckled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo said to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In response to the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken into skin numbers, about 90% of the patients were killed in both groups of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two trials, however, Altargo has been observed in the treatment of disszlessen (eited cavities in the body tissue) or of infections, which have been proven to have been proven to be effective or probably due to MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse event with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a maturity of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">Finally, the Committee for Humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo in short-time treatment of the following oversized skin infections across the risks were glaciated: • Impetigo, as infected small infirmations, depreciation or seams.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission announced the Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the market launch of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who do not constitute an improvement within two to three days are to be investigated once and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a Sensizing or severe local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is broken out carefully and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections where MRSA is known as a pathogen or believes (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with phyxiamulin in patients with infections, caused by a methicillin-resistance sthylococcus aureus (MRSA), was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, there is no improvement or deterioration in the infected spot.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibiting in vivo was not expected due to the low plasma concentration camps, which were observed in humans according to topical application (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After an oral gift from 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazol elevated the medium retinamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure after topical application in patients, dose adaptations is not required if topical reapulin is used during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive-productivity after oral administration and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of a systematic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo has to be stopped, the benefits of the nursing infant and the benefit of the Altargo Therapy for the woman is to be weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo have used, the most frequently reported adverse event was the event that was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Action method Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pandroutilin, a substance that was isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus thseaterianus (former Pleurotus passeerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesia by interaction at a certain binding of the 50s sub-unit of the bacterial ribosomes that differs from the binding of other ribosomal interleuial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding of ribosomales protein L3 involved in the region of ribosomal P binding and the Peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By liaison to this binding point inhibiting Pandroutiline the peptidylate, block some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of the entire 50s ribosomal underunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Based on the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Retapamulin at least some infectious shapes, a consultation should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin at S.aureus, regardless of whether the insensate was sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks involving additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucoci) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe received daily under occlusion on intact and screened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma proteins were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The rehearsal took place on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption of humans after topical use of 1% anointing to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP shirts.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, under a lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out more than 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human periphery cylymphocytes and in rats, in-vivo investigation, chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female fertility of reduced fertility at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which means that up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure of the human application (topical application to 200 cm2):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development tools (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The holder of the approval for placing on the market is obliged to perform more detailed studies and additional pharmaceuticals activities, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the approvals order, and all additional updates of the RMP agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Crossing on Risk Management System for Excerinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next periodic safety update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">For irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place, you should finish the application of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Apply no other salads, creams or lotiations on the surface that is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the saline look on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor to advice if complaints occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children aged between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix is applied in the framework of one out of two doses of existing vaccinations, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambient rix may only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and ensures that the vaccines existing from two doses can be ended at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collecting dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, ambient sounds or other hepatitis A- or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">They work vaccines by forcing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After having received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens than "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine manufacturer Twinrix adults and the vaccine manufacturer of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered within one of three doses of existing vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults were also used as proof of the application of ambient sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective anti-body concentration camp after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the vaccine is compared with a six-month period and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient stages between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children aged between 98 and 100% of vaccinated anti-body concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambient temperatures were similar to a six-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headaches, appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, Matte (fatigue) as well as friction ability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient rix may not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission announced GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. provides a permit for placing on the market of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grunms with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of election and the second dose to be administered after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collecting vaccination is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalous vaccines or with a combination simple.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis-induced anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) -antibody values are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully guaranteed whether the immunopic persons, which are spoken to hepatitis A- impotation, may also be protected as a protection, as they may not be protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injecting materials, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, the treatment of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization plan is recommended that the 360 ELISA units contained inactive hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combinated hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antiquity, so in these cases the gift of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a subtle impairment that should be avoided, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombozytopenia or blood clots, Ambirix can be injected as an exception as an exception as an exception of bleeding in these cases as an intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined Diphan-, tetanus-, inactivated poliomyelitis type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- Mumps-Röttle-vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunomouctive therapy or in patients with immune defects, there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, mats, headache and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier thiomerate and preservatives agent.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2,029 vaccines were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combination simple.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency ranges of pain and mats on a calculation basis for a vaccine basis per vaccination, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of ambient temperatures of 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had given ambient temperatures were about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that have been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Maternity was comparable high (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received ambient rates, compared to 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-cans intermodal additive).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of prestamped pain and mats was low and comparable to the use of the combination of the combined 3-cans vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the appearance of local reactions and general actions in the ambient temperatures of 360 ELISA units, inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, on the 6- to 11- year-old, however, a frequency response from pain (at the injection site) per dose, was not reported per dose.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines who reported about heavy side effects during the 2-cans vaccination schemas with the combination of 360 ELISA- units, inactive hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinated hepatitis B- surface antigen, was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">Clinical studies conducted at vaccines at the age of 1-including 15 years were the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, given to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, given to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was performed at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinable ingredient with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunity was evaluated, the Seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose vaccines significantly higher than with ambient temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were obtained in a clinical comparative study at the end of the full vaccination series between 1 and 11-year olds (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-cans vaccines with ambient rix or a 3-cans vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA units, inactive hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of Grunms between 12 and 15 years old, the permeability of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be proved over at least 24 months after immunisation with ambient temperatures in the 0-6 month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction in this study observed against both antigens, consisting of 360 ELISA units, inactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the permeability of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies planned 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambient sounds in the second year, when using a combined Diphan-, Tetanus-, inactivated poliomyelitis type b vaccine is given (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined mass mumps-rubella vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed for the present formulation of similar seroprotational and seroconversion rates such as the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resusade by eyee-particles and / or physical changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not protect entirely before infection with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccinations were finished with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are already infected with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus, if you are infected with hepatitis A- or hepatitis B virus (even though you feel like your child feel not unlikely or ill or ill) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection, cannot be mediated.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and packs at 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data published since the issuance of the first approval for the placing on the market, CHMP occurred that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Because Ambirix was only available in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited because of small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme, or with hyperhimic encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonium concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is administered - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, under the food or through a Gastrostomy (through the stomach mixture into the stomach of leading hose) or a nose onde (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, as ammonium has not been compared with any other treatment or placebo (a placebo-drug, i.e. without any active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also lead to appetite-loss, snorms, headache, headache, headache, headache, rash, rash, rash, rash, rash, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In the end, the committee for human health agent (CHMP) came to the end that ammonium has prevented with patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle to high ammonibility values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium was approved under "extraordinary circumstances" because due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients with a complete enzyme already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manipulate form (incomplete enzyme, which is manifested according to the first living monat), there is an indication for use if in the Anamnese, hyperopic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sill dysfunction is also available in Granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerances and the necessary daily intake of the patient's daily intake intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450-600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight above 20 kg and with adult-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early-manipulate deficiency of Carbamylate synthetic carbonate or ornithintranc bamylase, the substitution of Citylin or Arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a ginal inosuccine deficiency, Arginine must be obtained in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² per day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with sill disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulcera, if the tablets do not enter into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, correspondingly 2,5 g (108 mmol), sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">The AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as in case with sodium, and eco-induced clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and differentiation of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-indexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">For subcutaneous formulation of phenylacate of young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal failure and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cervical synapses and a diminished number of functional neurenings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined if phenylacniate is excreted to the breast milk, and this is why the use of AMMONAPS during the downtime is contra-indexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS in 56% of patients at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events did not have assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), commonly (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A more likely reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic endometriopathy with lactachiet, serious hypokalemia, Panzytopenia, peripherals of neuropathy and panic.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred at a 5 month old small child with a visible single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms occur with the accumulation of phenylacacetate, which showed an intravenous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosing limiting neotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacate is a metabolic active connection that is conjugated by acetylene with glutamine to phenylacetylamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylamine is comparable with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylamine is suitable as an alternative carrier for the differentiation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urinary cycle can be assumed that each gram of bias of sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylamin-nitrogen are produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis was set early and the treatment is started to improve the chances of survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of early-manipulated form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborns was almost always infin, and the disease itself resulted in treatment with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickling free analogue within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the use of alternative way of nitrous amino acids (sodium phenylbutyate, sodium ovylate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartal (but within the first living month) diagnose diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it came with many other intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manipulated form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Ornithintranc bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperopic encephalopathy and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients another deterioration of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacate, which becomes conjugated in liver and kidney enzymes, with phenylacetylamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its Metabolites were subjected to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in an empty healthy adult and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also examined in cancer patients after an intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbuts in tablets, 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, phenylacidate was detectable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis which have repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentration in plasma proteins were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Differentiation The drug is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjuicy product of phenylacetylamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus testing had sodium phenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granulat will be taken either oral (infants and children who are not yet to swallow, or patients with swallow disorders) or have given an Rhinensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">After the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450-600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight above 20 kg and with adult-growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early-manipulate deficiency of Carbamylate synthetic carbonate or ornithintranc bamylase, the substitution of Citylin or Arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granulat contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutor, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If Rattenaputes were exposed to the birth of phenylacate (active Metabolite of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramids of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A more likely reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic endometriopathy with lactachiet, serious hypokalemia, Panzytopenia, peripherals of neuropathy and panic.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylamine is similar to phenylacetylamine (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to transfer excess of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on the analysis of phenylacetylamine, patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that each gram of bias of sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylamin-nitrogen are produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients another deterioration of neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product once a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">During this approach the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and a large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (solubility of sodium phenylbutyrine is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they don't have the stickler waste material that can not take out after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you have laboratory testing, you need to inform the doctor that you can use AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">In taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist when you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">While still life you may not take AMMONAPS, because the medicine might pass over to breast milk and harm to your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, lactness, headaches, taste disorders, impregnation of the hearing, desic dysfunction, and deterioration of existing neurologically conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find one of these symptoms, you can immediately use your doctor, or with the emergency absorption of your hospital for the purpose of treatment in conjunction with the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you have forgotten the intake of AMMONAPS, take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood growth (red blood cells, white blood cells), diminished appetite, depression, irritability, abdominal pain, rash, rash, kidney disease, kidney disease, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist when one of the aforementioned side effects are significantly impaired or you will notice any side effects that are not listed in this assignment information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may not use AMMONAPS according to the data transfer and to the containers after "used until" the date of expiry date no longer.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Like AMMONAPS, and content of the package AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish colour and oval shape, and they are equipped with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If you have laboratory testing, you need to inform the doctor that you can use AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2876">In taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist when you have taken other medicines or recently taken, even if it is not prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should also have AMMONAPS distributed on same single doses, or via a Magenfistel (hose that runs through the stomach wall) or a nose onde (hose that led by the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take out of the tank a heaped measuring spoon Granulat. • Take a knife on the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove surplus granules due to a measuring scoop. • Take the recommended amount of spoons of granules from the tank.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood sugar), for example in instantine angina (heart attack) or myocardial infarction (heart failure) without "ST- Hebung" (a anomalous measuring value at the electrocardiac or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with anxiety or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients enrolled at the main study of the treatment of ACS, with the effect of Angiox in a single gift or in conjunction with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine in relation to blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently used a stent (a short tubes, which remains in the artery to prevent a clasp), and they additionally received other medicines for preventing blood clots such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift from GPI - with the preventing of new events (deaths, heart failure or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year overall, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI, Angiox was exactly the same as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other miludine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also be applied in patients who had a blood pressure, as well as people with a strong blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is a acceptable replacement for Heparin's treatment during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. approval for the market launch of Angiox in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instantile angina / non-ST-Hebbel (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency case or if early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient's patient underwent a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI application, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consisting of one-initial intravenous rifusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one to each subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus-gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt should be carried out of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines before use is carefully mixed and the Bolusdose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1,75 mg / kg of infusions dose is set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which can be subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate should be used from 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, it is a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg and once again test the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which resulted in the phase III- PCI study (Replace-2), which led to the approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes according to the gift of Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis patients is angiox contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox may end 30 minutes after the intravenous gift of infactional heparin or 8 hours after finishing the subcutaneous gift of low-molecular leparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• severe flooding against the active ingredient or other parts or an increased blood risk due to a disruption of hemoglobin system and / or irreversible effects. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and with dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully used during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudding is administered in combination with another anticoagulans (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI patients, under Bivalirudin, most of the blood cells occur in arterial points, patients who undergo a pericycle coronary intervention (PCI) can occur during the treatment of principle.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are waiting for the Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudding, a monitoring of the INR-Werts (International Standards ratio) should be moved to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudin should be achieved prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anticoagulanicia (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozyteners) can be assumed that these substances should increase blood risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudin with throcyboilers or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemoglobstasefire are regularly controlled in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental tests are insufficient in relation to the effects of the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, inbound or the postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomly assigned to either infactional heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients treated with Heparin-treated groups were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than with male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Heavy bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding entered significantly less often than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIVA inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular blood pressure or blood pressure in the point sector, reducing the hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known blood pressure, reoperation due to an bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localization that occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with bivalirudin in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in patients treated with Heparin-treated groups were more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than with male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding entered significantly less often than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, treatment with bivaliration is immediately breaking off and to monitor the patient with regard to the signs of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombone, which binds both at the catalytic centre as well as at the Anionenbination region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or to gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudan in Thrombin, and hence its effect is reversible, because Thrombin swap the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, allowing the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, by Bivalirudin with serum of patients, in which it had come to heparininductive theses / heparinized thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), no throcytes aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, Bivalirudin shows a dosing and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect which is assigned by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out in the patient following a PCI, an additional Bolus should be given by 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin and increases the infusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY trial was administered infactional heparin or Enoxaparin, according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronarsynsyndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-Hebdo (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor either before the start of the angiomization or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk factors, which required a angiography within 72 hours, spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurring Ischgl, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiovascular biomarker, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacokical characteristics of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who undergo a pericironic coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as a peptid has penetrated a catarabolism with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary Metabolite, which resulted from the split of the Arg3 Pro4-binding of the N-terminal sequence due to thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of his affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a process first order with a terminal sevenal time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected thigh or upper arm or is administered as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease which does not produce sufficient insulin in the blood of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very marginally of human resources, and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter effect time has as a short-effective human error.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in use in combination with a long-effective insulin-type insulin-diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 1,549 adults and a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">At type 2 diabetes where the insulin is not effective in effect, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the substance glycerylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% at insulin delivery per year.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal standard.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra cannot be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against insulin ulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from mortglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra must be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing on the market of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection, either in the area of abdominal ceiling, the thigh or the delay angle or subcutaneous via continuous infusion in the area of abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Gluconogenesis capacity and lower insulin change, the insulin need for patients with a limitation on the liver function can be lowered.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Each change of the effectiveness, the brand (Her-), the insulin (normal, NPH, zzinc delay etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can move the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or the demolition of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulant diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoitator; this states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient on an additional insulin number or an insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may be necessary to change the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of treachments of mortglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change with the conversion of the treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To increase the substances that increase the blood glucose activity and reinforce the tilt of mortglycemums, antigiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) Hemmer, pentoxetylline, Monoamin-oxidants, Propoxylic, Salizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of symptoms of sympathy, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserve the symptoms of adreside antigen, be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments for reproductive studies showed no differences between insuperiors and human beings in relation to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisles occurs in the human breast milk, but in general, insulin usually occurs in the mother's milk, nor is resorating after orally.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Here are listed below clinical studies that are listed in clinical studies (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of the real baiting data not be rated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silent, cool and bluff skin, fatigue, nervousness or treachments, fear, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, benefit of vision, headache, nausea and heart knock.</seg>
<seg id="2989">In the wake of the injection system, Lipodystropatrophy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, a lipodystrophy occurred at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe mortglycerides with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by an appropriated person or treated by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the urine and avoid similar episodes for the serious mortglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose levels (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous Gaube of insulin delivery occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem standard.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mactus, insulin delivery in a therapeutic gluing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in the gluing effect, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the gluing effect, exactly as human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lisisin has a twice as fast activity entry like normal human beings and achieves the complete gluing effect about 2 hours earlier than human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident in case of an application of insulin ulisins in 2 minutes before meal, a similar posteridiale glycemic control is achieved, like with a humane standard, which is given 30 minutes before meals.</seg>
<seg id="2997">In 2 minutes before meal was geared, a better posteridial control was given as a humanem normal, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin delivery is applied within 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given as with human normal standard, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as compared to humanem standard, which has been given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">At the beginning of the meal in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after onset of the meal in comparison with humane Nor- malnutrition, 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C) was given.</seg>
