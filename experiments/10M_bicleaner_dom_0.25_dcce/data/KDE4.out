the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; presents a further view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type I@@ d / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the distinctive feature of &amp; fs@@ view , consists in the size of objects of objects in sealed structures . each object is depicted by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the properties that the sum of the dimensions of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . consequently , large files can be easily identified if they are viewed down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you are considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view , is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simpli@@ fy navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaning@@ ful color and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either display depth for the slight detection of the disappearance or the image of any other file names like name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be used with the various characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can define if enough space is available , or if enough space is to be displayed or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates may occur at the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . Moreover , you can set the relative position of the label in rect@@ angle .
as a rule , as a rule , the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be met . please note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
as the division of a single entry is made for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be given . here it is intended for use and avoi@@ ding space losses due to always beneficial surfaces that are possible as square . the best methods on this respect are lines , columns or records .
you can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn in the area of the over@@ arch@@ ed entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

although &amp; digi@@ al came ; easy to use , it is a safe professional skills available . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC @-@ colour scheme - work@@ flow .
improved database with much more metad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means it is to support the support of the En@@ dan@@ wen@@ s . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; if you are interested in the program , the help menu includes an entry problems or wishes . this will open a dialogue with a stri@@ c@@ ased inter@@ connection . if you want these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report . please follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; is a project that is supported by a community . if you are looking for a regular user of &amp; digi@@ al , we would like to answer questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ al ; and hopefully we will soon answer any questions about other users . in this ma@@ iling list , however , you should be able to make this language powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about free versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ al ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ al ; registration is signed in the Develop@@ er @-@ Mail@@ ing@@ list . instructions for announ@@ cements in the Develop@@ er @-@ Mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; digi@@ al ; .

in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . this path is stored for all image folders .
you can also add a lot of folders such as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will you additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings can set up digi@@ plug .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder as a base folder . no image will be changed as an album . no image will be changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ al came ; dur@@ ating the library of the library in its whole depth . you can &apos;t close sub@@ folders , unless it is placed in vest@@ ed folder . you can do an extra bed &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to insert a point in front of the name of the folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums are taken in my Al@@ ben@@ list . you can change the albums by taking a popular photo from the album and this will then be used as a Alb@@ um@@ icon . for more details , please refer to the section albums .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ words , to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you may get around . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu of raw materials .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Labour Data .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be available to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and supports your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; of course any medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together with &amp; digi@@ plug ; together they work together .
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission . the camera can also be realized as a USB mass storage device ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has a constantly rising number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows transmission of images of digital cameras to host and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos are generally large files and transfers via serial port are now fold . &amp; digi@@ al came ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ rate support . the Ex@@ if support is required from some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera switches to read the pre@@ ferences . if the Ex@@ if support does not exist in lib@@ g@@ og@@ 2 , you might have any preferred pictures or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ plug ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I module : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ al ; the goal is to make the modules available to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ plug ; through the writing of a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ al came ; even perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
pulling and pick up images works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the surface area , via the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not able to cut data in key@@ words , data list or view@@ points .
- a data sheet gives you the most common records : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields , which is currently displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame . so the fil@@ tering works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is shown on the fil@@ en@@ ame . what fields will be shown in the dialog for Settings .

Find out Su@@ chen of the Type &amp; quot ; AND N@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ; ) .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technology , the hair algorithm . this enables to compare these images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two pixels , the more they meet . these technology is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can easily find any picture . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ er@@ ts the outcome can be increased or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere about the icon of an accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can leave it there .
sk@@ etch : free and @-@ colour scheme : draw a quick sk@@ etch and digi@@ plug ; finds the matching images . also here , a threshold value can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive box search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button in order to drag a square . all pictures within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ des@@ ner .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; introduces a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view inside the main window and use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light@@ table add from the context menu . the selection is added to the light@@ table and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ al ; main windows are open , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L Extras .
from the table bar you can compare the pictures you want to check in the left or right area of the window . if you want to synchron@@ ize the tool@@ bar at one of the pictures , then you can compare this at the other image , so you can compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to display fast from a picture series . if you want to navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar . use the left mouse button in any incident to display it on the left . the right hand side is indicated in the right area . this makes it easier through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal cancellation actions work directly from the lumin@@ ar as e.g. F4 file edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both table pictures . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in sw@@ elling function that can be til@@ ted to the crossed arrows . in order to hold the visible area of the picture , you must click on and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview the same image will then show the same image area .
the zoom works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom controls under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike to zoom into the image and go beyond . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital existing administration - taken away from the fashion word ? digital inventory looked after the image has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photographs receive , sc@@ ans or digital photos saves the form of digital existing management . but most of us do not make it in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up , protect and use photos . we are looking for downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , group@@ ing , group@@ ing , backup , evaluate , edit , waiting , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital coverage government takes up , inde@@ xed , categorized , sear@@ ches , trans@@ duc@@ ed , trans@@ duc@@ ed and exported content that contain a monetary or cultural value .
metad@@ ata is defined as data . metad@@ ata is provided according to your definition , information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you do more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find no risk management even longer . if you do not even know how many photos you do , then you do not use &amp; digi@@ al . if you do not want to save data in a database as well as safe archi@@ ving , you can remot@@ ely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first you have to do and know before you want to use any kind of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether you want to store other access to your computer whether you need to store them on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to change a bigger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location . if you are enough photos of your date . if you want to take sufficient photos , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for images you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , working hours , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archive and 5 % work files and you will not want to organize your structure for that content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the stack processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a re@@ directed picture .
we also recommend the metad@@ ata option in the settings page of the metad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ al ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the metad@@ ata from the database by choosing the respective point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want ? to do it &amp; digi@@ al editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , since you should select every photo words , labelling and evaluation . of course you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value then . you start the best with the rating or the leader@@ boards . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s go with key@@ words , key@@ words , as you are often called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you have cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source of embedded key@@ words , then &amp; digi@@ al came ; automatically inser@@ ting the tree to the right place . the changed key@@ words within the building is no problem and can be easily done by drag@@ ging a sub@@ structure to another . the changed pass@@ words are being pursued by &amp; digi@@ al ; the changed pass@@ words are being pursued .
the graphic shows how different metad@@ ata is over@@ thrown . this is a very rough representation , because each block of metad@@ ata is made of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are of all pictures .
enough of the key@@ words - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool around your metad@@ ata .
you just want to see most ni@@ b@@ ans your pictures simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your pictures .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details to see people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . Wow ! you begin to dream , associations , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer , to help Him over the motif that you can understand what you understand .
it &apos;s okay , if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can use a lot of text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as a label . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you are able to export your pictures into the label and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems , you will need to tell the story so for a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out into another city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train drives the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities the Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already in@@ numer@@ able and can be taken into the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travels with Google Earth . you can also view the pictures at the recording venue . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same freedom also applies in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information is stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ al ; as information , you should :
author ( syn@@ onym for activ@@ ator and author ) : this field should be your name , or the name of the person who used the photograph . if it was not desired to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organisation can be used , it should not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
aut@@ olog@@ ation ( syn@@ onym for authors of the author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work drawing of photograph@@ ers . examples may be like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mem@@ o to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the client field to identify who the photo offers . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations may be listed here . if the picture is a bearing picture , the group / agency will be given the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though these have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge of this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals this problem is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important to this protection .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ al came ; in the near future there will be such a module for pile processing .
topics : plate error , turn@@ outs , power fail@@ ures , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we &apos;re not talking about CDs that went on the road or a burning . these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negative . in this section it goes around problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data re@@ location in the world , has some interesting statistics that have a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you should not trust CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . of course you can also need CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe it is in your meas@@ ur@@ gy .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can reduce good dis@@ ks and good admission application . the best DVD recording devices are not more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s why you can choose the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very decent for errors , even if you have just written only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the check@@ sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , it requires chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , cr@@ ater , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a well @-@ effective program called I@@ so Bu@@ ster that works wonderful works with CDs and DVDs . but also similar applications are not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged dis@@ disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost 6 times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good start to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality format . read the media using a description , date &amp; author sign and afterwards protected on a clean , dark dry and dry @-@ protected area . do not forget to copy the data onto the next generation of media or software that can read the media or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for itself . their manufacturers guarantee include a new disk , but not the data . Google puts on this topic a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : floppy disks
shortly : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common fault rate , SM@@ ART cannot notice that error . some of the SM@@ ART pending error occurred . these are particularly reading errors and re@@ medi@@ ation count . the expected age time amounts to between 4 and 5 years .
here it is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a power loss before you have secured the files , but these losses are usually allowed without any major problems .
while most electrical devices are not lots of power , this can cause severe damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these anom@@ al@@ ies can cause severe data loss , hard@@ war@@ e@@ age , damaged mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves before un@@ avoid@@ able , which leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that one portion of energy heat is absorbed and the rest is gro@@ unded . it is usually in the form of a slots . do not think that every slot also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also consider that it provides protection against lightning strikes and protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage support which can also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage prot@@ ector protect your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be meaning@@ ful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting you , these devices can automatically adjust cordless energy if a power failure occurs . some models allow you to make sure that they meet the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifespan of the battery and the included software is interesting .
remember the potential risk to avoid your computer system and get his security at power problems with the cost to avoid these . one high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your calcul@@ ator is using it . finally , you should always remember any cable before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to save any amounts of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home , however much expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send data on compar@@ atively slow internet .
solutions are therefore suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it &apos;s not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com is available on photos and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online . the professional variant gives you more at your disposal , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for 25 $ a year you get unlimited storage that should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer and are included in the offer . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ able .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are due to the transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the integrity of data between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have destroyed a photo . it is quite troubled that there is no protection for it . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with the TCP protocol is a much safer data way than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission errors because they generate Inter@@ pre@@ ferences within the data flow . these errors remain un@@ noticed at normal file systems .
even if you are currently not concerned particularly of transmission problems , you should see in the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes every year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates to be able to handle and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % for job systems . in case of not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks this proportion is already the percentage of theft 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them think . it is currently limited to a lower damage as such as theft or re@@ install@@ ments . and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . an excellent English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process at a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file was not saved before the problem arose , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is that while technology develops further , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rough@@ ness of all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are going for compact cameras and the end result is too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive are now responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , you can do no one for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected according to a plan and test this backup before you make some dangerous like the re@@ install of your operating system , replacing plates , or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning strikes you when the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget the plane crash : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole space or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ preventive means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to enter your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . this is a snap@@ shot without History and represents a complete copy of a time .
differentiation : one backup of the files which have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . this creates several moments of snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only constant and not continuously updated .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that can easily set up your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that have been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security above ss@@ h .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach gives you plenty of time to discover and restore . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly penalty recording for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . every further di@@ lu@@ tion should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and metad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , Use of the Internet .
in order that valuable images will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predi@@ ctable because of your nature is un@@ predi@@ ctable . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to manage as a certain wax . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are fully compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easy to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for any time . if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite easy : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the reference pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means that in fact , enlarge it means .
let &apos;s go out that you have placed the scal@@ ability with insert and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated record or partition . if you are using * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it onto a new plate :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; Ds ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; Ds ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software any software you can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task is simpler from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF . but it can save much more . it is funny , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per colour duct and full transparency . P@@ NG can use Gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color information but not as many as T@@ IFF is needed and a slow compression . this format would we recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as picture format . it manages photos in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . however , there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw material format . D@@ NG has been developed on the T@@ IFF / EP format and is required to use metad@@ ata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may possibly be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe is the XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . this is a label of XML and R@@ DF . the file information are stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers take it before the original size of your recording , mostly in the raw material , as it can file the metad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it may think about problems when using the metad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and therefore you should think to use D@@ NG to use containers and place everything there .
the Dublin Core metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to support for fully compatible online metad@@ ata standards , discussions and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI @-@ communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and con@@ n@@ aissance efforts to achieve comprehensive acceptance of metad@@ ata standards and practices .
import images of the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are used on the camera ship , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a host@@ ile processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; then you should add the metad@@ ata again . these were cut off from different programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it into web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code them in MPEG , you can use contact leaves , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ al ; in section add a photos to an album , you will find a description as you can already have on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your album bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; use this with the machine , switch the camera to the display mode and switch on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is , a fer@@ vent indicator will appear at the bottom end . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information on each entry . with the page features and metad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single entry or a metad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be saved internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image does not have been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
the rider metad@@ ata shows the internal metad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or the image processing . note that this metad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is to download and then choose the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . when downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select the desired standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you select photos , use the button to download and then select the selected button . the button exit is long as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have been downloaded until now . in this case , the new pictures are highlighted with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course you will only download the new pictures .
if you want to download or download the buttons , a dialog appears where you can select the target album where you can choose from normal folders . details on folder sorting can be found in section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once , by pressing the button loos@@ ening . if you want to delete a few , then you have to select this first and delete it later .
please note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera . you should definitely check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to complete the camera , you should make it much faster than the camera .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially balanced names . the fil@@ en@@ ames can usually lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you can upload photographs of different shooting galleries in the same album . hence , it can be useful , the date and time when the image has been made , to integrate the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirror @-@ based sub@@ missions . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the options During the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos stored on the plate . the first two affect the data on the author &apos;s standard author@@ ization . if you select this , the appropriate entries will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different file format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . switch on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command @-@ time .
if you use the option to use camera file names , you have the possibility to change the file names in small book letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo , is displayed below the name , which the camera is stored in the preview . your settings can be stored and automatically used if you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can also use all information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic turn during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in section Page bar metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is normally switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is stored in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the lower range of the window .
if your camera has been made information about the date you can use &amp; digi@@ plug ; this sub@@ tract is based on the picture data . all the pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same size album . not all cameras provide you to read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button Create Advanced and select the option of dates at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to upload images from their computer is to download the button . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; displayed in which you can select the files you want to upload . you can also choose more than a file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the pictures will be uploaded to the camera . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that the data can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . the determination of the data can be displayed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ to@@ ise an area through automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural office and real estate agencies can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users can send a postcard to document the location of the photos , it is good to send the position data of a photo .
the question is how the GPS data do into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , arti@@ fic@@ es and card refer@@ ral . there are at least three ways to achieve this . right with the correct hardware , about a re@@ working of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic classification ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera which has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few that work together with GPS receiver . either as card module or transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be loaded with ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must store these data in the GP@@ X format because it is the only format that is supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate to the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ viewed coordinates used by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com is no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; try to change as much control over its working course as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; you &apos;ll need to set up these settings . you can change the settings dialog in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
this option can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image processing . thus , specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the default value and copyright data . these data are automatically selected into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected for downloading from the camera point . also , with a database synchron@@ ization these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ ation@@ is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s writing tool : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be interpreted as a photographer , freelance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is also a further explanation for the author of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the picture . this must not be the author if this is entered here for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group or agency should be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions absorb the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this metad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; digi@@ al ; these metad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost .
image labelling used as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments using the images embedded in pictures . in this way , your labels can also be read by other images . attention : for pictures , which already contain labels , these are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ al .
the page settings contains all options for the information displayed if the mouse poin@@ ter is located in the main window of a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and some video formats . to consoli@@ date you can add the file extensions of this list and added any file in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which is not this extensions , is ignored by &amp; digi@@ al ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset you back by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the standard values . however , some pictures have only different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In all the image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , the picture frame uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color you can select this here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
the image and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this type can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images can be coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the exact explanation .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG @-@ files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time to use and un@@ pack . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the T@@ IFF file , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no effect on the image quality because the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is fun .
with the setting @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save you . even if you were written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metad@@ ata was not yet supported , but it was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ al , the image processing was only a picture aspect for photos . currently , it is highly developed to manipul@@ ate a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 wre@@ aths with V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance is used immediately . otherwise the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white color is not set . standard , it is a fixed colour balance that was photographed in sunlight on a white map .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the use of the second sensors has the effect that the exposed images will get more details in the top of four steps . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the pointed star , so the parts of your images are burned to catch the top white in the settings . use the adjustment of transparent white in the settings . you can use the adjustment of some unusual results , as they are able to re@@ design some parts of missing information from the sh@@ utt@@ ons .
this is possible , as blue pixels generally not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w is therefore trying to re@@ design the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three compromise and can be adjusted individually for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you must probably set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ image processing can be done too . to keep the time for the demo model , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ del algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the video data , which offers many cameras and which is available with a matrix of color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives at your disposal : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces Far@@ bar@@ te@@ facts on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result .
if you know the color content of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a colour closing correction since you are carried out during the conversion .
a profile translated the colour information and are instructions as they should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ plug ; information about the colour information from a colour space in the other to translate the colours as exactly as possible .
behavior Quest@@ ions if a picture is opened in image processing / colour management module with raw files .
color profile folders click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all of your profiles . &amp; digi@@ al came ; check out the folder during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles here have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your Profile to deposit . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file later .
the colour scheme view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are managed to manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturers and model you do not fit any profiles . there are some , such as Canon , which contain no color ton@@ m@@ apping or gam@@ bl@@ ame . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not make conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the ton@@ m@@ apping themselves .
there are other options like the soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied . this could be correct manually , rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious that the color profile for them is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can detect the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image view and display cables ; many modules support they have been written to cooperate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I module , you will see a list of available modules . choose the settings that you want to use , and these modules are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ al ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can also find some examples in the context menu of the pre@@ viewed .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in .org or in the books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the pixels , usually there are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other tick fields turn off the metad@@ ata , or from which at the bottom end of the pictures are displayed .
the camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right side , a button Autom@@ atic recognition that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , and you are currently here serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from camera alist@@ e . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / joints , where you insert your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera with your machine to switch to the display mode and switch on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear on the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for shifting from &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; at the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo in a album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down by &amp; digi@@ al ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also add the display of the welcome image of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the starting field you can accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ al , under circumstances .
when you want to search for new photos and digi@@ plug into new photos . this is extended to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ al ; if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ al , you ask if it should delete it out of the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can choose from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be displayed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your pictures and to correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of My details : editing .
the editing pane contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in circumstances , they are not part of your distribution . you will find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in section image processing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the top edge and underneath the tool bar for fast access to the most frequently required functions .
the processing functions of the image processing changes your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before using File or button stores from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should also make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by creating or use the button &quot; button &quot; restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last store .
nearly every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by creating processing reverse or restored , by selecting re @-@ use from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the &amp; L@@ MB button on the rear wheel or restore button in the tool@@ bar you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions have also been revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between pictures in the same album or the same sample , by using the navigation button in the tool@@ bar . if you have made changes to the current picture , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can put in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . normally you will see the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can change this in the setup dialog of &amp; digi@@ al ; you can call it from the &amp; digi@@ al window . see the section for setting the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the menu file and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or entire propositions . all images can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album exp@@ orting printer driver . if you follow the Assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side bar at the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images are available . the same page bar is available without the navigation system , also available in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same tab , the side bar will appear and disappear once again .
in the labelling view , you can input labels with unlimited size or insert it . note : the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the labels will be copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labels in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after which you have commented on , you can either use the button or change the button to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button . with this you can read more metad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also download the metad@@ ata into the files , but this is always done if you select a metad@@ ata settings that is always written into the pictures .
the section evaluation shows an assessment plan of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ption . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the key combination string C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . in order to evaluate more images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the evaluation will be written in the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the sample view shows a search box to the fil@@ tering of key@@ words , the sample tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; -@@ meeting made words .
the key@@ word @-@ tree is adapted to the entered key@@ word . you can restri@@ ct the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many key@@ words .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering a picture series . if you typ@@ ed various key@@ words , these are stored for quick access .
key@@ words can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key@@ words of a picture will be stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several images are selected in the main view , select a key@@ word in the sample tree , this will only be applied to the resulting image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the sample filter section .
the sample sheet is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , sample and view@@ points . if there is one or more key@@ note filter from the right side , only the edges of these two are displayed . all key words are available .
you can also draw up key@@ words and place . suppose you have several pictures in the main view . if the sample has already exists , you can simply pull it out from the right side bar and put on the selection . this appears where you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures at a cal@@ ender date . the sample filter is based on no key@@ words , which have been selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word from the right @-@ wing tree was pulled down and put it . a dialogue asks if this sample is to be set .
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . it can also be switched on with Settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or to be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry will be searched for the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
you can define a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have used it mainly on &amp; digi@@ plug ; s adjusted for concrete implementation .
the reason why you have a color@@ able work@@ flow , the colors of your camera or sc@@ anners have actually seen a predi@@ ctable or scanned colors . using a color @-@ administered work@@ flow you can compare the colors on your monitor from your camera or sc@@ anners , and that match the colors that match you or in the web from your digital dark chamber .
if the topic in color management comes , everyone wants to press the buttons it must be provided for the results which he wants to express . unfortunately , color management is to provide you sufficient background information on color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions to make sure you receive the desired result .
when your work@@ flow flows all six below the criteria specified , you do not need to take care of color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image costs are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ R@@ GB is the de facto facto standard .
so if s@@ R@@ GB work so well and makes life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space so that you need to make thoughts about colour haz@@ ards ?
a visual example of Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ an region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colors , please visit Bruce Lind@@ mere page and click on info and then click on information about R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ R@@ GB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ R@@ GB color space or do not need to install your monitor . if you &apos;re working as a color space from s@@ R@@ GB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions available to improve the image in most cases . therefore , use a further manual processing .
the functions standardi@@ zation , equal , automatic and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ating Autom@@ atic Cor@@ rection is automatically attemp@@ ting to make the best of your colours . you will need to experiment with these effects to see what &apos;s best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without its color sha@@ dy . this function is often a magical correction for pictures which are dark or balanced .
the same method adjusted the lumin@@ osity factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is as flat as possible . this makes the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automated : this method maxim@@ izes the color space in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire history of history .
contrast , this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of R@@ GB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the Weiß@@ er equals &amp; digi@@ al ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white cut of a photos .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are so far from the origin@@ ality there are areas with over@@ exposed points . if you can perform the white content in the shell mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways are better to correction .
this tool is based on a white salad algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start using the menu entry colors white like the image processing .
the window window can be adapted to the size . on the left hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the target picture . if you want to see the original white settings , then it is enough to click on the lower window .
the preview of the target pictures has a red markers . the L@@ umin@@ ance of pixels below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right side , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because most pixels have very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or their sum will be indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow of Just@@ ices can be improved or dim@@ ms down the shadow of your photos .
with the controls mentioned above , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and afterwards somewhere on the image preview to use selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white button . this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white button with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed index increases the colours when more than a color channel is over@@ exposed . this will be displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
save the buttons as and store exactly this . every setting of the white @-@ button you have set , you can save to a text file and load later again .
the Pre@@ ferences button does all filter values return to their standard values and the associated neutral white button . note that neutral settings will also be another photo as your original . if you save this , your origin@@ ality is changed .
you can set the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ie@@ fe per color channel for the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . this coding does also need more plate , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG for formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ m@@ apping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be set to rate the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound value . this tool is easy to adjust even your settings , so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of exposure to correct the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects gives you four colour effects , a solar power effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon effect and a can@@ opy filter .
in times of chemical workmanship was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that had completed the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier from the additional light . this was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dar@@ ker and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to easily adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity is controlled by the solar factor . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase generates a negative image that is not possible to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original is the ( 1 ) and the same intensity ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one of the best optimized color film from the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated paints in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers strongly saturated paints but also some photo papers , especially those of the barely landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ light sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the test result and the shooting repet@@ itions the strength of the Ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures the filter can transmit the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to experiment with the tools in the menu under colors . all your Just@@ ices can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you make a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , this tool is a good choice to improve the satur@@ ation instead . all changes you can do in preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ le / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog appears at this tool very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ der . more concrete the three shooting below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a Gra@@ ph of Int@@ ens@@ ity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the Gra@@ ph there are three shooting values which can be shifted in order to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is the regulator to move and make sure that the picture changes .
on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated , based on the settings of the picture , the following options are available on the left .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram is dominated by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
three knob : the top for the dark sounds , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ c .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the inputs of the shade , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for an automatic alignment .
output : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each section . there are also two controls which can be used to evaluate the output files . for example , the compression of the output values can be used for example a somewhat light image as a background while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the values of the image .
save and store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded . this Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes you will automatically adjust the colour pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the evaluation of the Hist@@ o@@ Program for Rot@@ - , Green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees .
the option of over@@ exposed means controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and allows you to display the combined score of all channels . this is a indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the entrances to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically updated on your settings . the following options are available on the right side :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel provided by the module :
in addition to these we@@ bs , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the images which have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you shift a short vent@@ ri@@ dge to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones can correspond with dark di@@ abe@@ tic patterns and the corresponding image pixel dar@@ ker will be dar@@ ker .
the preview of the original pictures is a red marking . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change a point on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move it to and from where the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve you can have created with this file system and later loaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p spa format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun@@ bathing . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the origin@@ ality to set the check@@ points for the Rot@@ - , Green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the option for over@@ exposed pixels controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined outcome . this is a indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ ette and sun tones was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the origin@@ ality is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel Mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the shades of colour .
the channel Mixer is another developed tool to mix the color shades of the pictures . you can process it from the menu colors channel Mixer from the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison over your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red markers . if you place this in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . this is especially convenient if you are also the option Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , as the channel Mixer then activate DAS tools for the generation of great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green light for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a colour is different from small rough@@ ness , which looks different from the colour channel and their sound pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion which allows you to reduce the colour at first .
store as and store buttons will be used precisely for this purpose . any bl@@ ender position can be used for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p @-@ mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposed means controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and allows you to display the combined score of all channels . this is a indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your stra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step , because colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford D@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good for portrait pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against heaven . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Orange .
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ tic effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar light for daily time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the natural shade correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and with it similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the sha@@ kes . this is very similar to the process of supp@@ ression of a pressure and recovery in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; use tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture on your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the engra@@ vings of an ancient master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry painting texture can be used for it .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text effect is applied to the photo below . the original picture is shown ( 1 ) and the change is changed ( 2 ) . the relief relief has been set to 200 .
a decorative frames can be added to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; a decorative frames can be added to an image .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not easy task . it is possible to keep his attention . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ u@@ ating eye . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ wn eye . below frame , the module can be launched from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , make the desired frame type for your image . penet@@ rated the image with a thin line and a wide range ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , it finishes it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which fits perfectly for one bone and decorate the decorative frames with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format text in any picture at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . you will need to adjust the character set size . the bigger the image , the larger must be the character set . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , down to the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture was saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; use tool template for use a template on a picture .
the menu image template apply to the image processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions about size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add to a reduction in file size of the template . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size , simply send an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ U@@ sers @ k@@ de.@@ org ..
if you use this tool for first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the template . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for templates was placed , a tree view is reflected in the folder structure of the template . the selection of a folder updates the template automatically .
below the preview you can find three buttons on which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this knob resi@@ zed the picture below . if you want to use the template around the position . if you want to apply the template onto the whole image , check the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button in order to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adjusted to automatically the pre@@ mise size .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates particularly in dark areas , cor@@ ni@@ es pictures .
dar@@ ing mask works on the contrast of the edges to look at a picture . actually it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ est and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by Winston Chang .
focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this means that sharp edges are linked together to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for the private user .
with JPEG images , often a camera had been applied in internal scar@@ f . images in the shell @-@ format should always have to be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners apply a shar@@ pen@@ ing filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by pressing a photo with the pair of shar@@ pen@@ ing work . you can call the menu entry in accordance with the menu entry .
you should hereby know how the results do not work very naturally : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , you can achieve further information about the menu entry . in Re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture is much easier than shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry basket and experiment with settings . the reference window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your pictures . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the image . the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values are often producing good results and should be tried at first . an increase of the radius or viewer ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the dar@@ ing mask to be strong , smokers and the impression of Gr@@ aten in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius offers a lot of pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures at the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ant picture , which is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the absolute difference amount . you can define a minimum difference thereby if areas are used with a soft change between the sounds from the shar@@ pen@@ ed and therefore the beauty of beauty in faces , heavens and water surface areas avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the working image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Re@@ focus is focusing on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ing Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to focus on &amp; quot ; re@@ focus as only to try the photo . it is used to use a technique named F@@ IR Viennese fil@@ tering . the traditional technique is usually achieved better results than un@@ sharp mask . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice , the circular boom works much better than the Gau@@ ge . the Gau@@ ge has a very long tail , which is far from the sw@@ elling pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse is also widely influenced by the remote pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse is even very heavily influenced by the remote pixels . this causes undes@@ i@@ rable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of rotation of this module . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very un@@ sharp , but should pay attention to hal@@ o .
correlation : a increase in correlation can help arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in space filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely . if the sound pressure is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very po@@ or@@ ly . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value becomes even more pollution .
incline &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your im@@ aging Gau@@ ge is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you should use a value equal to zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the rough@@ ness filter .
mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . if you have great values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
store as and store buttons will be used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters will be saved for later and then can be loaded later .
try to perform all the cutting , colour and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but immediately left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you check images and comp@@ ress images , apply as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mask produces better results as a shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask to use a larger neighborhood as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theoreti@@ cally , un@@ sharp mask must always produce ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the immune system . practically it is the result of the F@@ IR Viennese filter always at least as good as the dar@@ ing mask . the F@@ IR Viennese filter is often better in processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp colour screen has to be corrected . this image has been made with a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods used in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator S@@ pet@@ te sets the sharp@@ ness of the area that was dar@@ kened to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te makes a modified color for p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools in order to remove no desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the indoor algorithm was developed by the IM@@ A@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ ferences as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre @-@ ferences are displayed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders and advanced settings .
detailed explanation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a constant G@@ etting over the image . a value of 0.9 should keep the details so that no scar@@ f is needed . please note that the details of the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smo@@ oth@@ ed evenly into all directions , while a value close to 1 is used only in one direction . if you have a combination of film or CCD lar@@ ches will produce a high value wave similar pattern . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum G@@ etting factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value as suitable for the degree of space in your image .
rules : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is difficult when it &apos;s difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect it must be higher than 3 .
repeat : is how often the algorithm will pass through . usually this is 1 or 2 .
prot@@ esters wing@@ span da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected , then small angle should generate a long run time . you should therefore choose this value as maximum and acceptable for your needs .
integ@@ rating range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integ@@ rative stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to leave it .
save the buttons as and store exactly this . each setting of image errors correct this can be stored into a text file and can be re@@ loaded later .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the correct calculation at any time .
below you can see as picture error with Small Ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was done in Guatemala City with a analog camera . like you see there is a unique black ar@@ te@@ facts during the journey caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original picture is visible under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug came ; a noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a highly protected algorithm by Peter rear .
this tool provides a selec@@ table image filter to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor rough@@ s from the camera or mother@@ boards ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on digital cameras from digital cameras , you can read these in English in this tutorial .
the screen image above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain of grain which can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can be found in the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filters . large values increase the period that the filters are required per pixel and can be adjusted by the radius of the radius and the colour in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing to determine the filter points . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details cannot get more and noise or lubri@@ cate .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire space can be removed or smoke @-@ pointed . set it at a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a weak or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
colour : controls the color toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are corrup@@ ted more strongly to increase . it also contamin@@ ate the atten@@ ap@@ iece .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping factor . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased to occur , cra@@ fty and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for smokers that you have set , can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ charged .
this is an example of how rough production can change your lives . the original one is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct tune with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture of cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw a little soft@@ ly for your purpose . do you use a lot easier than to shar@@ pen with the menu entry basket and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the reference window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ al came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ ar@@ te@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ rable ar@@ te@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to immer@@ se Gau@@ ge &apos; Smo@@ king , compression straps , compres@@ sive images , compres@@ sing in digital , original or later digit@@ ised images . the smoo@@ thing occurs along the image con@@ tours and thus obtain the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tur@@ ers . the tex@@ tual error is carried out with another tool , the error correction is carried out . the algorithm for restoration was developed by IM@@ A@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ v and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of comp@@ uted compres@@ sors , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
save the buttons as and store exactly this . every setting of photo @-@ restoration can now be stored into a text file and will be re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
in the bottom , you can reduce the photo with a rec@@ ep@@ tive noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 iso has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious combination of film on the faces . the original one is below ( 1 ) and that correct under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can reduce the scan ar@@ te@@ facts which have been read from the scanner illumination and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is visible under ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows to remove Hot@@ pixel by photos taken with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw quality photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in oppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixels ; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with the knob dark . the tool will realise automatically the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have a old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should find the correct image of the dark image to correct the correct image . note that the W@@ iz@@ ard will notice the final image , and automatically re@@ load this automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview can help you correct within the image . the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all departments .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ ation : it is measured an average of the neighbouring pixel size . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel can be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block can be moved to comp@@ ose a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then is used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drag@@ ged to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug came ; a vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ ment , i.e. exposed corners , to correct a picture .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , often can &apos;t even illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they can reduce the corners and the edges of the image , showing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses exhibit also this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 for aperture filters , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also use the center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are created through movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s filtr@@ ation and colour or grey sc@@ anners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter in a shell filter that without this filter has been applied . the tool is protected by a Cent@@ er@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three Reg@@ ions , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the biggest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or randomly offset the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ ment , reduce it around a small degree .
leu@@ kins , contrast and Gamma Settings : the edit of a picture with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is reduced the lumin@@ ance of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , as you only need to increase the settings as desired .
if you want a fin@@ er re@@ positioning of the target image , then adjust the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ ment in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . an leu@@ k@@ stronger and double correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ al came ; Lin@@ scor@@ ner distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ des tre@@ ats the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or trun@@ cated shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect , but fla@@ p on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the card is corrected to the removed corners to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion may be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values , tonne @-@ shaped distortion may be corrected and positive values will be ho@@ oked distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth Gra@@ des . this value acts stronger than the edges in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter specifies the parameter to the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus introduces a correction first degree of gravity . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
light : this is adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values increase it .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows a preview of correct adjustment . the values you use for your image will be stored and used next to the next start as standard values .
the tonne or tur@@ quoise correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . if you make this correction as all first by . if you make a picture new to cut and carry a tonne of tonne correction would be the effect of the folding .
in order to help you find the best correction to you . move it to an important place such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can adjust the tons / kis@@ sen@@ shaped distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a kis@@ sing shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or the zoom controls from this dialog .
for most pictures the tonne @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings it is the perspective to correct the angle in the image 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tonne @-@ shaped correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original one is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ e.@@ org web page . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you shift the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters of film particles and film sensitivity ( ISO ) if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ding texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film particles and the domin@@ ance of paint green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
because the filter channels make the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ tering on a landscape portrait of New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the modified picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ al came ; filter film gra@@ dation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce screen@@ ings on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of films to improve the manufacturers of large silver gra@@ ins of photo@@ em@@ ulsion .
the film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere lo@@ osed from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic images , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular gra@@ ins of the body . the default value is , even higher values need to be used on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of film @-@ effects on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working @-@ based film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ al came ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ al came ; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regulator to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush are better suited for large images . smooth the leaves or from the other side are considered .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original one is marked with ( 1 ) and the result is marked with ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ al came ; filter charcoal drawing uses dy@@ - and intensity gra@@ dients to define a spro@@ ut shape . therefore , images of the gra@@ dient is slow to change . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to outline . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a range of range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator choose the pin size and the lower limit the contrast ( G@@ utt@@ te ) .
this is an example of charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ al came ; filter engraving your image in 3 @-@ D when it was st@@ amped into wax . it is using a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important content . the filter uses the difference between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default settings .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion @-@ effects . it uses protected protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image in cells and look like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using imp@@ etus effects . it uses protected protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ flu@@ ence : ignor@@ ing the picture along glob@@ ular lines that eman@@ ating from a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ aging a zo@@ oming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ usal : ignor@@ ing the picture by rotating the pixel by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the visual acuity of a rotating camera .
ran@@ ge@@ al : ver@@ ge the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera in@@ let . the object appears to step back in the background .
motion detection : im@@ aging the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ aging of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or a train , camera .
soft@@ ly im@@ pregn@@ ation : ignor@@ ing the picture soft@@ ly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle light .
bulk soli@@ ds : ignor@@ ing the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ aging of a arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart sharp@@ ness : finds the color basin in the picture and get it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore stop this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the shelf drops are a nice small tool to make shelf drops onto your image . this makes it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ ge protected algorithm .
tropical size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the drop @-@ size is not necessary with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures . the number changes the number and density of drops . fis@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
you can stop using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing offers a range free of control drops . use the sel@@ ective tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which shall remain free . if you start the filter drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the shelf drops . the original picture ( 1 ) displays a quiet sunset and the working image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can take it by mirror or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu individually rotating or trans@@ forming mirrors .
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photograph in a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to reduce it is simple . the great question is how you can find a picture im@@ b@@ ble and the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm here is used here , making it a good job . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select a change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture of a better quality , then try the tool for bubbles .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ al came ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IM@@ A@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are recorded below :
lower aspect ratio maintained : if this setting is enabled , when the new size is maintained , the aspect ratio of the original picture is retained .
rules : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is concerned larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect it must be higher than 3 .
save the buttons as and store are used precisely for use . each input can be used as a text file and then re@@ loaded later .
photo shooting is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example of picture bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a commonly @-@ guided operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimate tool with the mouse , simply create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut out . this allows you to change a good overview as your photo after cutting . you can drag the size of the rect@@ angle , creating a new rect@@ angle with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button The cutting @-@ button in the tool@@ bar and the picture is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file saved file or file save in the menu file to save the newly added picture .
in the pre@@ stige range , you can change the size of rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain .
in tool After side @-@ aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in the high format the larger amount of height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned .
the tool After cutting aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to select the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can use the max . ratio button to cutting the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After cutting aspect ratio saves the settings regarding aspect ratios ( Horizont@@ al or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data can be reflected in the original image and not the original image .
the settings of the help support permit help to bl@@ end up your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are an option to cut a rect@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden middle is a division which is on different natural growth pattern such as the spiral of a Naut@@ il@@ us mus@@ sel or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it dives into all sorts of things that we are considered to be nice .
the golden partition is the Ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the old Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you set up your pictures , buildings and even photos to make your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule will be interpreted as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden centre provides liquid aid lines if you set up a picture . these help will be recorded below :
the Golden Spir@@ its will get good results for your photos . compared to third party gel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rect@@ angle is used to direct the golden spiral . that can be one line or different objects . this can be easily accessible without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden triangles are also leading up from the above mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , gold triangles are not equ@@ ilateral triangles . diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object of dynamic .
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame , create an effect of professional photograph@@ ers and dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information into the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach otherwise .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the relief lines can be invisible . on this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current picture .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to hold the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; please select transformer and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module allows you to position a horizontal and vertical line . after moving it to position the mouse poin@@ ter in view of the picture , you can attach it to a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned out a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function transform@@ ations from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option gl@@ ands a bit after turn . notice the above warning .
all per@@ tin@@ ent transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty zones that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees to the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
according to the custom@@ ization of the perspective , the picture will be a little contamin@@ ated . for a single configuration , this effect is small but two adap@@ tations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective , you will get unbe@@ aten tri@@ angular holes in the corners . the possibility of this is to cut the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer .
check your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press it horizontal and vertically at the same time . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right side of the screen .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the image , the picture will be a bit wis@@ ely . for a single shot this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings create twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this .
after switching the image , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an option to eliminate them is the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the species such as these libraries were comp@@ il@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to the dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; displays only files in formats known . this happens using the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions . you can modify this list of file extensions ; in section configuration you will find further information .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital photos . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , gl@@ atter@@ e results as JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s is also able to save loss if it is listed in the settings .
if you want to experience more about the raw material , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw material images in JPEG or T@@ IFF using the raw image converter of &amp; digi@@ plug ; in section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ al came ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ al . all support cameras you can see below at the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ al ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . if you click on a film file and therefore does not have any built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a film file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use the program to play .
go forward to the previous album in the chron@@ icle . you can only move forward when you went back .

the K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files may be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do if the initial contrast was very good when the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four Just@@ ices with the White module .
many tools you need the image processing need in &amp; digi@@ plug ; included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , sound pressure , editing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform sealing type that shows the effect in a preview . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the pre @-@ area to change . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected pre@@ stige range .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper range shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pre@@ stige range .
vertically share . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper range shows the original and lower part to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the face area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show up over@@ lap and exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can move this frame with the mouse inside the picture and look at the part of the picture , from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower right corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all settings are noted from the last use of the module .
the page bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely in@@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Features : shows a summary of the most important parameters during shooting the photos . these data are available from the EX@@ IF data if available .
this rider provides an intuitive box search tool based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button in order to drag a square . all pictures within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and use colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined colour and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folders after files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pallet view . here , the color name may also be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection . in order to produce such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressing lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the check box is inserted in the box colour , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cur@@ sor . the colour is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box below .
a selection that was created so as described in the last section , can be used with the actions copying , cut and inser@@ tion .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in intermediate position : for any color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end sign if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the intermediate position , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colors in the palette and output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find the colour selection on the left .
&amp; graphic presentation ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ programs are used in science , especially in Computer Science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ ite ; includes , are dated after view of the program author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; graphic presentation ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic presentation ; displays Gra@@ ph with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of graph@@ s in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph@@ s re@@ calcul@@ ates and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; )
menu to open the Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
load large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to display more than these no@@ des )
other needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that requires &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph@@ s , you need :
the main window shows the opened Gra@@ ph , each in a separate window . initially , if you start &amp; c@@ graph@@ ite , the main window is empty as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar open only the icon file and open the ( empty ) list . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you select one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like at the bottom of the screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse bike ( high and down without special ) , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you see the maximum reduction of a Gra@@ ph .
if the just written in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; charged file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; if you want to ignore your decision . if you want to change your decision later , you can select your decision later , you can also use the menu option settings .
if you open a graph@@ ite file outside a current &amp; graphic viewer ; you can open a file or check ; on the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , or want to present the icon in a sub @-@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can permanently store your choice , but this can also change with the dialog dialog .
at the program start , you can open all Gra@@ ph of your last session . again , you can save your choice both and later .
you can also define how the graph should be divided into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s , which are to be placed on one side , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the Gra@@ ph .
side review with one on several pages distributed Gra@@ ph without head@@ line and with a different font
the page again gives loading , if a file was modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page Open is the possibility to define the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ e.com ; it is possible when a graph open out of a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( or in a window of the already ongoing session ) or determine that every time is being asked .
the seat management page gives the possibility to define the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if desired to be asked at any start .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorith@@ ms . entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ ite ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for gr@@ ated graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of the al@@ ph@@ al . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as possible as few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for in@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the spr@@ int model . this process is used by Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , the same as important is with statistical @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created a jump model layout as a diving model layout . it uses the fruit @-@ clean@@ up @-@ clean gold labelling , and includes a multi @-@ ten@@ se for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm as@@ sures the k@@ not to be circular according to the description of Six und T@@ oll@@ is , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several times cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the Graph@@ ene after st@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such layout command you can give &amp; eg ; -@@ algorith@@ ms special options , or change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates in the metad@@ ata of a picture and edit . the ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sample of the image and loc@@ alization may be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo , used to loc@@ alize the monitor and latitude .
in order to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call the menu . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course this file contains the same time as the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded , automatic correlation is performed in red shows . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera @-@ time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . click here your camera zone .
setting for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera @-@ eit . the deviation below is the deviation below . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a trace from a place for images you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and the difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then cor@@ relate to the button .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialogue . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog box will use the button OK to use the button OK to set the data at the current picture .
the location can also be found in accordance with the displayed area and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge it again , until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite photo and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities the GPS data to hang on the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool uses to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages about version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 encoding in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders to be adapted to the settings . the riders are allowed to select all the albums . the albums are not allowed to choose from hier@@ arch@@ ical . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the view shows and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is created largely self @-@ explic@@ it . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in the picture . otherwise , the picture will be shown directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your corresponding images . select a folder where you write the write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite which contains everything will be created there .
if you selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is also stored in the new images .
with other colour depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size influenced . all other settings are explained even .
the rider tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the screen@@ shots , that are little images displayed in the gallery .
a progress chart shows the user how far the action is . press release to break the process .
if the module produces the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program reports to determine whether mistakes can occur during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to show the preview of the gallery . press closing the module to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture gallery is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view the pictures .

after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG down@@ stream module is a tool to change pictures without blocking your quality .
this module allows to store pictures listed below , images in the JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality and metad@@ ata .
the consequence of the loss free storage is that the file size is increasing because there is no compression of the colour information . this is also noticeable in P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ b.@@ g. attention : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metad@@ ata editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de.@@ org of the K@@ IP@@ I teams .
with the import function of the metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from a picture to another . if you want to copy the image files in the main program and then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metad@@ ata . the data will be copied after which you have pressed on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide .
the MPEG co@@ di@@ zer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module allows you to insert a basic transfer . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ ash@@ au .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for your DVD player . with this module , it is possible to use the formats DVD / 16th CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the media , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first choose the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then recorded in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , 16th CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the picture transition is specified below . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast to a very smooth picture .
the background color can be set as next . in doubt you should set it black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as close as the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can convert the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can go fast or enjoy a coffee , and enjoy the Di@@ ash@@ au when you return back .
if a hint appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages over the button settings .
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper in standard phot@@ ometers . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the im@@ print Gim@@ p . this is , for example , to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original size of him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get a d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first you can convert the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for white , brightness and red / blue amps . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later on .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch doesn &apos;t work effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains unchanged and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ held algorith@@ ms and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , T@@ IFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses the loss free L@@ Z@@ W Com@@ pressed .
if you need to edit your images often or later , you should not use the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality wor@@ sen@@ ed . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as memory format , the metad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file , stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the stack mode mode allows you to convert various images to once . do you use this mode so if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility to write existing file automatically . this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can put the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the template .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of image collection . it uses the convert program from the I@@ mage@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can add the image , or enlarge it . in addition , four types of image changes are made available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adjust your image to screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo printing . the user can set the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the imag@@ ined images in advance . more pictures may move on the list of pictures below .
after completing the module , the images window with the images displayed by you will be displayed . using the button images you can add another pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last selected picture a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also move pictures on the list of pictures and add it to the list of pictures below .
with the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of the selected images .
after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the new message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected have been attached as an app@@ endix .
pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it &apos;s possibly a good idea to send multiple messages when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be stored and always used until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images into a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and not to change the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the imag@@ ined images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can watch the status messages in search of mistakes . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose , you can sh@@ lie this window ? EN .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Excel option in presentation is very elegant image transmission via Open@@ GL . you need to have an appropriate graphics card , because otherwise the Di@@ ash@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ames can indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower right corner during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . you can then manually break the case manually with Es@@ c .
the option images randomly select that the pictures are displayed in a random order , so the sequence of images in the album will not be used .
the distance between the pictures can be set between single images . 1500 millis@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should be out about the presentation of your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between whom you can choose . random from each transition between the pictures a different effect .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left of the screen . move your mouse in this corner to switch you on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the Di@@ ash@@ au .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file names , the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation .

&amp; brochure album ; offers you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; brochure album ; integrated and the other as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user book , the version is described in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create about the menu file HTML ....
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , every area is more precise .
first you enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next you select whether a &amp; photo@@ CD album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the review page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
last you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . in this way , you can avoid that information can be displayed without a description . note that all pictures are exported from a party . please note that this setting is therefore not used to hide certain pictures in particular .
in this area , you can define how the HTML page should look like . most settings options are clear , which is why not been made specifically for this .
below on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . in this way you have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images for example have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore change your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission rate , as well . if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different file and the URL where your website is stored .
best choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent proposition a new sub@@ folder .
first you must select the main folder where all your images will be stored . this folder will be stored and set automatically at the next time . this enables you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if this is a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL that you define here should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser needs to start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you need to manually copy them manually . in order to specify import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the only described sub@@ ordin@@ ate settings have all three based on basic folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will set , whose name you define in output folder .
if you &apos;re looking for a family party , a meeting or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; you may , of course you want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures . if you have already turned out a HTML page on the pictures , recording site , etc . , you &apos;ll have to do with &amp; cool album ; this work will not even make it once more .
with &amp; CD album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . you can import other files into your database . the properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves whether the pictures itself are stored in the file or whether you can find all images into the file , so that you can keep all images into the file , but the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu File ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file sear@@ ches the images that are found in the folder of .@@ k@@ in file . if the respective images are not found , the images of the URL that you have in the folder of HTML files are searched for . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML @-@ export .
the following will be described by the dialog for exp@@ orting images which you can export about the menu File ... .
the most important option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . there are also the following three selection options available :
when you can copy the manually into the .@@ k@@ in file , you will have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ in file copy and copy photo@@ electric album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ in files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG files and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the Export file compressed .
the last option of this page is a maximum picture size limit . if you want to send your friends images , as the .@@ k@@ in file would not be very large . here you can limit the size , by example , that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file containing the extension .@@ k@@ im out of the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ter ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ CD ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to impor@@ ter consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folders will to import pictures .
it may be that you want to person@@ alise the category of people of the imported file ( if you are a D@@ ans ) , while this category is asked to imported the categories of the file to be imported , and what categories they are to be imported in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example you can see on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images to browse and watch : if you see pictures , you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday groups and discover a picture of your friend with your friend , perhaps you would like to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) fixed information about your images , about ( 2 ) search and look at ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today your videos also cares . at many places in this manual , more pictures are spoken , but often it also closes videos with one .
&amp; cool album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your pictures . this is a simple XML file that allows you to backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal backup tools , copy on a floppy or revision in CV@@ S where you want .
&amp; brochure album ; now remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future launch . if you want to start a different folder with images , you can start your photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
about the menu entry settings of photo@@ electric album ; set up in a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will discuss the different settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can open a preview setting and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can define various properties , e.g. people , places and key@@ words . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up full scale groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ate club as explained in .
in the selection list , you can select the selection options available to you . in the list box list , select the category you want to configure . in the left window half there is a list of the current category and in the right one list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; cool album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . nutritional information is available on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it can be tested that the modules have been tested with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can be downloaded either via the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu assistance . do not say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , thus making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you spl@@ its functions with different applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications also using K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; photo album .
sim@@ ulated &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures you are showing the picture preview currently .
in addition to the current album &amp; brochure album , the modules also have been handed over a list of albums . here you can download and cool album as follows :
if &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; s brow@@ sers in the category of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the user dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you &apos;re using the category persons , your photo album will be selected , so if you would have selected individuals to view and to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area modules that modules can be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start your photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can see your image database . in the section we will not display any information about your pictures . in this section we will show pictures that shows you an overview with all available images .
one of the main features of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image has been added individually or for a larger number of images certain comments simultaneously . if , for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sers , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these comments when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in the list of three lists with a text field , by choosing people , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can use them again when you enter information on your pictures .
the following idea is the move to the pictures within the list : if you are a family party and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can make sure that the used names are postponed upwards , those persons can be found faster and arrange .
if you prefer to see a alpha@@ betical list , click on the icon for sorting to date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you might want to edit these images and add these pictures with comments . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to select all of these images and add the menu item multiple entries to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . in order to show that it is a transition group , a special symbol will appear .
in the context menu of the note , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also add an entry to a category and to make this entry in a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you are ill@@ iter@@ ate just your categories alpha@@ betical order .
you can move the individual elements of the note @-@ catalogue , by clicking the vest , which form the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drawing it out of the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a box completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and here a window will see a / exhibit . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with pre@@ views of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter here . you can see the size of the pre@@ ferences , by simply pointing down the mouse with the intermediate button of mouse , configure .
if you make an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this image will be displayed . if you have no window with a picture of view , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from you want to delete either the remove button or choose the menu option . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; cool album ; offers you a solution for this problem . of course you can also use your photo album . of course you &apos;ll need to record the pictures anywhere . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed pictures from the hard disk can be loaded .
pictures where the upper right corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pre@@ ferences are available , so &amp; a photo@@ CD can display the preview of these images . you can also view this pictures with the picture gallery .
as you see this feature , you need to copy the files from the folders and want to copy them again . if you want to avoid trouble as you want to avoid your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to make a little more privacy , check out the pictures that you want to un@@ open for others and click on Cur@@ rent View on privacy . alternatively , you can also see all pictures that can view your little sister , control and choose the menu entry .
with this you have set the pictures in the case of the case . if you lock the laptop now in case of your little sister , simply dial the menu entry images , allowing all the pictures you will be locked , hat@@ ched . if you want to get the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to un@@ lock the images . in order to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection shall not be sure to read or delete all images on the hard drive and to the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ turn@@ key text . this type of password protection is only for purpose , those with &amp; ki@@ cking album ; not very familiar to keep the look at private pictures .
the reason why you manage all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe it is of course that you want to look at some point . for this reason &amp; ki@@ cking album also features a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have to enter on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure it with the mouse , and you can also configure what information is displayed and if all these options are available on the viewer . all these options are shown below .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene had chosen .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back up by using the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a slide show . as frequently , a new picture can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus respectively Min@@ us . the Di@@ ash@@ au is stopped by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of viewing the viewer in full screen saver ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to change in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer , you can just pop up a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can re @-@ zoom the plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so the picture is not zo@@ omed in . with the same button , the zoom button places the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations are working with videos that are in and zoom out with the Plus@@ - and minus minus are .
with the screen@@ shots from the context menu you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make remarks on the current picture with the menu item comment from the context menu .
if you can view pictures , you can find a picture of a person whose names you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog of the image to select this name . however , you will only draw the image to mark and look for more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and select it as good or bad as you watch one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view pictures with features , while you can watch . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you press the corresponding letters . see a picture at which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have placed features on your pictures , you can see you in your browser . if you have all pictures you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , this is described in . after that you can use one module to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to make .
categories and particularly characteristics can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view the categories in DR@@ E presentation , then you can add features to the pictures by pressing the letter to the feature after the picture was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; a photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the common old is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the type you can reverse your common later .
in a picture , you can see a picture on the painted box . to switch the painting mode from the context menu . in order to complete the painting from the context menu , simply add the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; you need to work the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views .
you can also select several objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object because all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry in the menu .
if there are more possible positions , the following entry menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right button of the mouse , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have properties , click for users to assume these changes . if you entered in@@ valid values , a message is displayed with a bug description . then you can click the input error and dis@@ card the changes with dis@@ closure .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter files in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own view .
press a preview in the self @-@ quality view and a small example of the scene is rec@@ ited with the selected texture . if you want to selected a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
screen photo shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a visibility level . you can specify this value relative to the visibility level of the higher object or the absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them unlimited . you can also save several window arrangements and simply change between different orders .
to start a window via or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views to each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cardboard box above .
the last possible window arrangement are floating Vie@@ ws : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the base , drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small to the top left of the arrow in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ tion .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ tion . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can make them at any point .
the current window view , you can save with view window arrangement ... save . it will appear a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have a scene created , you can render them . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to Ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed correctly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu entry to the scene .
a R@@ ender @-@ mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert multiple R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon &apos;s icon in the tool@@ bar or in the menu view , select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender @-@ mode has a name . you can enter every name , but it is a name that can recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only one small section of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section into the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ x@@ ions lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture emer@@ ges with only a beam of pixels , different errors can be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ cco effects in curves and lines , also sometimes details will not appear if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses an anti @-@ ali@@ asing technique to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures of this property can be seen better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects the P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam of pixels . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . the second method is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive , because every pixel is continuously being divided and adap@@ tive because every pixel depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels , then both pixels are comp@@ uted through the tracking of a certain number of pixels using super sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel size . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted individually .
another option reduces ali@@ asing effect is the generation of rough@@ ness for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for the quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map card you can set whether the alpha channels should be comp@@ uted by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have not met an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; first scene , select the menu entry file impedance ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; yet not the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if any error messages or war@@ nings occur , a dialog box shows a list of messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ ren@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source text into the text file in the text editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source text editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can use source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also inser@@ ting .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er . usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray is usually called .
if you click on the help in your own business view , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version supports 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 versions .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; sear@@ ches for external files ( for example height data ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path into different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
colour for the wire design . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the colour of rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the windows type plate .
you can set the points of the points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values are a more precise wire model and thus provides a better tw@@ ist for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the details stage for two directions .
if you cross @-@ less detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection screen . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess tables pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess tables pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you are able to activate cant@@ il@@ ation , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ ders of scenes . the values for depth and threshold values can be adjusted . in detail , the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in section window orders will be explained how you can create window arrangements and store .
combination field standard window arrangement : displays all available window regulations . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when start of the program .
the list required window arrangements shows all available window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with button inser@@ ts .
any window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and may not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can create and delete the views with button Add .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with a card box , you get a card box together with the previous view and suspended the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start out without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create simple scene , very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully notice the following war@@ nings , before you keep it difficult to use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program to first time you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you will receive a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black picture .
if you have anything faul@@ t@@ less installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement is :
take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree contains now a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentary about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
change anything on the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that you can change the camera in view of the camera , with which you can change the destination point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button to a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button users or input button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could adjust for example a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert end@@ ogen@@ ous body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a sensitive method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; it actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as the floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view shows the plain now even if the moment is only as limited level . if you ren@@ own the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you watch the object Tree below , you will find that you can find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : scale , turn and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizon , only that you get to know some of these parameters . choose the shift and set the values as follows :
just select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose the moment some times .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object is supposed to be inserted . you can change the name in the object tree ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview , how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only shows a matte black material because you can still need settings for the pig@@ ment . do you think that you can check the look at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est thing .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader &amp; ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now set correctly . if your image is now available with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the color list . here you have to enter two new attributes . in the color list , select two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this record twice , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object olive tree , select the colors in the object size and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step , you should be able to carry out this step , as you should have understood the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; you should have already understood the ball as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object features , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button application ) , so that the sphere in contact with the bottom . otherwise , the ball would float over the ground as you have moved the ground around a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering is now a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . set the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to your own . as already in the bottom , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as color :
just select Sub@@ object and change the name for example in bul@@ ment pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ments , then select single @-@ colour and set the values as follows :
but you can get more decent effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen images , and click on application or press the input button .
the settings of shine effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of which possibilities &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er now offers you . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender @-@ method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ ve a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ c@@ en , the rendering of the hypo@@ crit@@ es from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera which is reflected by the objects ) is reflected in the scene , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will work as fog . thus , the scene pixel will be processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will be able to see the scene without a camera . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously done with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er before .
whenever you can open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and disk space .
presents the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage have been rejected .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have the stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be chosen if you have used the reverse reverse .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er . , here you can change the look , the keyboard and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the key@@ code . you can modify or add new commands to this option to change the default indicator for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ i ; commands or add new ones .
open a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a possibility to compens@@ ate for rough surfaces without changing any diff@@ ra@@ le on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a more comfortable image of view and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button Return .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a matching file name was found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog for Rent - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three , General and machining and slide show , you can adjust the mode of work of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser , the keyboard cuts can be set for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can keep further below . the default is no full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when opening the name of the last opened folder . next to opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder opens in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can show &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so that only some of the data types are displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be extended to the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specifies whether the slide show is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the image change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default value is 1 .
change the key@@ boards for the different operating modes of &amp; ball @-@ show ; in the case card short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser .
use this option to switch between the second part of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short presentation .
displays images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
this reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
displays the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; also closed if no browser window is open .
show the image in original size . this is only sensible if the automatic scale is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; entertainment photo ; is a &amp; k@@ not ; image processing based on &amp; fix@@ ture ; image processing . &amp; entertainment photo ; is part of the digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; entertainment photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your pictures and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; entertainment photograph ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on that the user does not respond to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; entertainment photo ; makes it easy to report any errors or possible improvements in the program , where you can use a link with a link . if you use this , your browser open one page to reports from problems and wishes . all required information are already completed , and you can simply follow the guide to give your message .
&amp; entertainment photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are looking for a more common user of &amp; entertainment photograph ; and hopefully you can answer any questions about other users . in this ma@@ iling list , English is spoken , you should be therefore powerful .
the best start to get on &amp; entertainment photo ; to join it , it is the developer of ma@@ iling list . guidance for accession to the developers of ma@@ iling list by &amp; entertainment photo ; .
&amp; entertainment photo ; try to change as much control over its working course as possible . there are many options that change the behaviour of &amp; entertainment photograph ; in order to set up these settings in the menu settings . you can change the settings dialog in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left .
in the scope of exposure indicators , you can select the color which is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposed intervals should be selected . de@@ x@@ ter@@ ity should display the colours with what you are to view in contrast . sub@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure of a dark colour .
the main window of entertainment photo ; features a side bar at the right edge to provide you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also find it in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ ill@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan , pictures that doesn &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and pick @-@ up .
&amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and remove images . &amp; sk@@ ill@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for storing or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can view the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the san@@ e project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projected ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard sc@@ anners can be set on the command line of &amp; ski@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialogue is opened to choose the scanner .
the user can choose to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop &amp; ski@@ an@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat these options .
in order to insert a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ fix can then start scanning area for the final scan , which is started by the preview button .
in order to choose the picture better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom that the complete preview can fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you want a preview of View in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a pre @-@ window window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and sch@@ ema ? EN leads to a crash and you will come back to the main window .
the button Settings is open to the ep@@ onymous dialogue in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user may consider the picture , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option has to be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be cho@@ oses .
this setting allows you to select the way to store each picture . dialog for storing each picture opens the dialog in front of any given picture . if &amp; sk@@ ill@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a pre@@ defined folder , then you will need to select Save without any fil@@ en@@ ames .
this setting defines where the images can be stored in the option without any fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric Su@@ ff@@ ix of every single image , if a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user may adjust to store image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Select the image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE aid with the &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button includes the K@@ DE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs key cuts . below you will find a list of this shortened and its function . select a list of these cuts in the Player window and select Glob@@ ale key@@ boards . select the &amp; amar@@ ok ; select with the right mouse button in the Player window and select short commands ... select .
you can also flexi@@ bly set up existing multimedia keys that operate them as &amp; amar@@ ok ; therefore make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; - control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly used in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , players , playlist , playlist , playlist , and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some own command options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing relationship . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user doesn &apos;t run , why a script is not running .
Beg@@ in Re@@ qu@@ ire &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos;s Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is to @-@ this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the Scri@@ pts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend the required functions . you will quickly notice that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange with amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should pull every K@@ DE installation .
most scripts themselves permit the evaluation of external programs and commands . for this purpose , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy can be called . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; send al@@ er@@ ts to all the scripts . for this reason , scripts are to monitor their standard entry continuously and react to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use of it .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to store the storing and loading of the setup data each script needs to take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; b ; with deriv@@ atives further information about the new piece ( for example , the metad@@ ata , or the pieces ) .
volume change new@@ volume indicates a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le has been handed over to the selected entry into the playlist , so you can use the script function d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok Script anchor Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to use one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok Script to the e@@ Cust@@ om@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; completed , or if the user fails to stop a script , sends the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , to work space . e.g. , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ah script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages to accept content packages . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) to the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the wi@@ ki scripts side of &amp; amar@@ ok ; apply for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ not ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; can you go to the playlist , rather than to work through endless menus . perhaps you are just looking for a very specific title of thousands of staying in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have already some playlist , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then the playlist is still difficult for you . and if you are still difficult to choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlist , select the correct music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an outstanding support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many gen@@ eric USB devices . furthermore , many different useful functions make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and del@@ ick - just the right to experience your music !
usually you need to enter the folder folder of Amar@@ ok sources , to comp@@ ile to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok , and install :
da &amp; amar@@ ok ; Auto@@ conf and automatic make use , you should not comp@@ ile trouble when comp@@ ile problems . if you encounter problems , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; N@@ ok ; like most applications some options that you can enable or dis@@ able to comp@@ iling a comp@@ iling point with the configure script . this is a list of available options available .
for some of the compilation options certain dep@@ enden@@ cies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in section system requirements .
activ@@ ist de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use full @-@ full use .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort across the setup dialog . the dialog dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok ; .
player window indicate the player window in addition to the playlist or from . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
vote barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mod@@ od@@ able , the experimental function of the voting per@@ ometer is switched on .
note that this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mod@@ ulation @-@ bar . this makes the color scheme used for voting rights .
tuning files with the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for fashion@@ able music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ y / mo@@ od@@ able / ) .
external brow@@ sers : can you choose which brow@@ sers of &amp; sp@@ ends can be started , if a browser needs to be needed .
using other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not located in the list .
playlist , saving the current playlist , automatically saves the current playlist , when switching &amp; amar@@ ok ; . activate this option if you do not want to lose the running playlist .
relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , &amp; n@@ m@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
current piece of the particle changes clearly causes that the playlist windows opened / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when using the context of the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the appearance image you can custom@@ ize &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can use the use of various writings in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise , you can select ty@@ pe@@ an@@ ists window , Player window , and context @-@ browser . press ... , so you can select a required font from the selection dialog .
with the selection user defined color scheme you have set the source of choice and you can set their own color scheme . use the matching colour selection for front and background colour .
the start of the start is that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start the playback will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which they stopped at the last stop .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display it is displayed , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog box to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes that the text is sha@@ ded in the O@@ SD .
your own colors are given to you the possibility to match the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color surfaces will open the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not activated , the pre@@ set &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
the input field display text represents the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering the input , the O@@ SD can be adapted to their own needs . below , you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama user . so you can define it on which screen size is to be a multi @-@ way monitor environment to appear in the O@@ SD .
the audio card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers are able to activate additional options in this box card .
the kart@@ ing card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder where you can browse through the folder and browse through the music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes as well as with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folders : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders after music is well as well .
control changes : allows &amp; n@@ m@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added , or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import@@ ing the playlist : causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found playlist into your collecting folders ( .@@ pl@@ um and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . automatically added re@@ plac@@ ements will appear then later in the playlist browser .
the portion of collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ SQL . if My@@ SQL selected , further facility in the sub@@ window My@@ SQL device is needed .
section My@@ SQL device is used for setting up the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; this calcul@@ ator is used to enter the My@@ SQL database . afterwards , under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessed . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use us@@ ern@@ ame : and password : to insert the data required for the connection to the database .
the cart@@ el card last@@ .@@ f@@ m uses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can deliver the names of played pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create new music recommendations on the current piece of music .
here enter your User@@ name and password for your lor@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
sending the played pieces and updated the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to over@@ load the names of the played pieces at your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; n@@ m@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be viewed on each piece . note : you can &apos;t see the list in the context browser . note : you need no last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and gallery with screen shots .
amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have installed it ( including the included programs , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of it to find such modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD prec@@ eded that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , it will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example problems , but we are trying to use amar@@ o@@ K to all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably you will see one of your files a mistake in the day Li@@ b library . you can make this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers among bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org and hang it to the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection .
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes the Met@@ a @-@ Info out of this file . please report to this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers among bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org .
if you use My@@ SQL as database , try time SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; n@@ amar@@ ok ; is slightly mature .
make sure all of you have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if B &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then this leads to crash when working the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able automatic switch if in@@ active for ... in setting up the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us a backup by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good back@@ stage , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many program files can write data as UTF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a file , but these are not as Unicode labelling . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The File $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &apos; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; ; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : :
&amp; N@@ ok ; s symbols are always active in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamics ) . this is a well @-@ known fault in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can see the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this bug : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : Un@@ sure symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ map , then check if amar@@ o@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . you can see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Per@@ amar@@ an app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that amar@@ o@@ K finds the right version first .
there are several options . most of the installation problems are obvious to the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for other users or among the developers . they can also use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de.@@ net in channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only a mistake if something is located on the retention of an error in amar@@ o@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist . how do music pieces come inside ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files in the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the launch window was converted into the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user , while the points will be automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the evaluation rate must be displayed in the playlist , and select column rating . click anywhere in the new application column to set the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you would like to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist , from the fol@@ dable menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist , and let it fall , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s that simple : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , next to the adding button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; n@@ m@@ ok ; new . look once again to lib@@ visual , this package includes many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find him about the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this is really true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / NM@@ M / M@@ AS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty any only audi@@ ble audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can de@@ code the text and P@@ NG de@@ coding !
it can be ! perhaps you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the default is no MP3 decoder . the solution : old @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 box , input button
start the Y@@ a@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender for the same time and use simultaneously audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware Mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . look at the help code for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of the problem and help a solution . for gam@@ ers you need to specify another sink ( e.g. cast ) .
this does not do so . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded at first . if you are looking for most people the best option if you are looking for a decade or with little over@@ head . G@@ spre@@ aders reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can issue directly to AL@@ SA , exactly as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the Settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ism ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see the next point of the FAQ ) . make sure that art@@ is@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia @-@ Code@@ cs that may cause to create reproduction . read this bug report . read this error message in your AL@@ SA file setup .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably you use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less mot@@ ions respond the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to remedy him .
G@@ spre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change my stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashing &amp; amar@@ y ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ stre@@ amer you need to register all components . do you register @-@ register to record all G@@ spre@@ aders components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( complete Cat@@ amar@@ K before ! ) : - Lo@@ ading m@@ peg files , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder by G@@ spre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you can find the module folder with record @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the register register again . start now &amp; n@@ amar@@ ok ;

how to get the currently in &amp; cat@@ ok ; ongoing title if you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you Inter@@ pre@@ t and title of the current piece from : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user &apos;s re@@ user name amar@@ ok player , Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and Ihr@@ user name with your user name . this requires that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be split by &amp; amar@@ ok ; press up separately on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size variable window .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please enter the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of stor@@ my and thus also caused a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; n@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . hence the / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output modules . you need to configure &amp; amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
presumably you use an distribution that installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ spre@@ aders is installed , the necessary developers need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards you have to re @-@ compiled and install again .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use amar@@ o@@ K to use the second sound card ?
under settings amar@@ o@@ K ... audio output give you the device . typically , for example , H@@ W : 0 for the standard sound card and H@@ W : 1 for the second .
here you see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ - 8x@@ 0 { type plug Sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 0 &quot; type H@@ W card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug Sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type H@@ W card 1 }
specify the check dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib also takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the skins on sound card m@@ map .
we &apos;re sorry , but the audio output with the Arts will not be taken away . you may naturally take this problem of course even into the hand ! if you want , you can get the new so urgent co@@ aches for Arts : )

in this dialog window you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator completed the burning process .
this quick instructions should show you how to copy &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD can be done in just four steps . to complete the steps you &apos;ll have to have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you have in the CD @-@ ROM drive in the CD @-@ ROM drive .
for copying a data CD , select Extras , CD copying ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; please press the button Start . you now see a dialog of the so @-@ like looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original file is completed , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC may not find the &amp; k@@ de ; wid@@ get modules do not find this problem . to fix this problem , add q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug to the search engine for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your basic folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you can get the latest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get rid of the feedback from the forums and learn more news .
if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ not ; 3.1 and Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; does all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; features all the functions that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; normally , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; normally automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning of CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burnt audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented free and professional technology for audio encoding . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
MA@@ D : here is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio de@@ or . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a wide developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . lame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , allowing you to read and write F@@ LA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ pack decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a program program that can convert between different audio formats and can be used . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
Trans@@ code : a command line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully @-@ equipped author system to work , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for the creation of mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different albums of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that can be reproduced differently to the music .
e@@ Movi@@ x : here it is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save is displayed , with which you can select folder and fil@@ ame for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would be calling for each individual project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what should happen . you can then dis@@ card them between save and changes . furthermore , you can also break the closing and open the project .
exclu@@ des all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will be asked for each not saved project , what to happen in the same way as if you were called for each project File .
closes all open projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not saved project will be asked what to happen if you had called fil@@ let .
if you call this entry , you can select the associated dialog for adding the project . that &apos;s the same effect as you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium you can only open when the project contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can change many project related settings . each Project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you do not use files for multi @-@ seater CD . this is useful if you do not use files for multi @-@ seater CD . it is more likely to help you , so that you can already see the files and folders on the medium .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function returns &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files will remain in the project . all other files will remain in the project . this function is not removed from the medium , it only ends the files imported files .
open the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows you to create a CD on a CD . alternatively , you can also only create one copy of a CD which you can then move sometime later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning , if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD copy to another medium . alternatively , you can also find the possibility of converting a DVD with the help of copying or copying files , so the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for loos@@ ening a CD @-@ R@@ W . you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog for form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which allows the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the write model and incre@@ mental camera .
burn a previously called CD image . the dialog asks you to burn after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously er@@ able DVD image . the dialog asks you to go to a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously l@@ ent DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoder settings and even options to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the specified medium . these information will be displayed in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents are displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ lock the drive or cast out the medium .
this is switched on or off . the table screen allows selecting and pulling files into the projection view . the table view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head@@ line in the projection screen or out . the head@@ line is a nar@@ rower area that contains only visible when the proj@@ ections does not contain any real function , it looks pretty nice and separates the proj@@ ections clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key@@ code for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part you can continue to adjust the key order below .
this will kick off the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants can be set to burning CDs and DVDs . thus , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opening the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programming settings can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should operate simultaneously . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alise and the fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for example , is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by using a sh@@ ell@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the fair programs give you den@@ te .
in this chapter , we assume that you are using the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the command line d@@ co@@ p , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b has started ; then enter something like this on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ ines ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts listed below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ chni@@ cal Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Movi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Movi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref ate e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Movi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref curr@@ ent@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Dan@@ cop@@ y@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) , An@@ gle C@@ dr@@ d ( ) of the Bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) of the Bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can obtain a project via the command line : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can get a reference to the project by # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
this cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) is cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String ) . add@@ Ur@@ s ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String ) . ( Q@@ String path ) of the other ( Q@@ string path ) of a ren@@ ame It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) . ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) .
this makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h Project = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der Mit@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project add@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; C@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; k@@ de ; can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; C@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress &amp; CD data on the hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers , which can be encoded as standard as MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( loss free compression ) . further co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and compressed into WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , read the &amp; CD , it is used by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ do ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must now be done .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to comp@@ ile itself . however , only the co@@ di@@ ers are installed , which is needed . if the F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not necessary .
what encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Co@@ di@@ ers provides a small introduction of co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sive factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; as already said , uses &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ ano@@ ia to read out audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD is not possible . in any case , it is not possible to handle the mechanisms of the copy protection . avoid the mechanisms of copy protected audio CD .
while setting up only once must be made ( the setup dialog may be called so often called up to a suitable configuration ) , it will be explained after the daily use of a &amp; CD . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ bled at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD . get any information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can be fully operational without any network , whereby everything will be included manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab for configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB enqu@@ iry of the CD data is set up in accordance with the establishment of a CD@@ DB registration card . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case , first the connection to the internet must be made . )
starts the read and - when an encoder has been configured in the settings tab in the setup page - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read from another encoder as standard . it is noted that in advance the encoder has been configured in the settings dialog .
open the file manager , so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
open the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ pe@@ as ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finishes ) .
opens the main dialog dialog of &amp; C@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats using data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes today a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt &apos; free , lame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but it is open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resul@@ t@@ ant compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a Tit@@ le . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ H &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR 01 stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from young people , portable devices and car ster@@ e@@ systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without view of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which can be manually entered or through the program automatically via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be transferred / used with &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; and the code name to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ words ( english : day ) add if MP@@ 3s must be coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt from lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ scre@@ ator must be added ; the result looks like this : ... -@@ tt { title } .
this is a summary of &amp; chew@@ ing dio@@ des ; parameters that can be used ( = button drawing in the Assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which persons can read / input the information , so that all other information can be downloaded from the computer itself . it is noted that here only from text is said : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not an attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent that from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added . all information can &apos;t be added to the artist by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell can be received .
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; is actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used for retri@@ eve the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des are set up ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical zone should be used on the next lying mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and equ@@ ates the load between the computers .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of refle@@ ctions for online check @-@ out of &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the full database can be downloaded or ( usually created per month ) only the updates of the database .
which alignment program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; anyone who wants to know exactly the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD . it &apos;s always aware that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the matching distribution must first be installed , if this has not been done yet .
to store the read WAV files , the coding and thus the desired file format may be chosen . during the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ ers package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coding can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . further information on co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter of Wel@@ ding Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a co@@ di@@ ers , more information can be obtained through the input of a command like lame @-@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check out the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the write and readers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to specify both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD . do not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give the tips as you need to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , but they are still un@@ sure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step example , and you will get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , and read all our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; using MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ words ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled pack@@ ets for your Linux distribution as it is not quite free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source file what you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ ams on it ( eg ; by copying or copy ) .
the first section tre@@ ats the basic setting of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; , something that is thought to be done only once , and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for every wi@@ ther &amp; CD .
here we define the used coding for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . where we are la@@ zy to use the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with any of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device model is delivered to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to install the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the cart@@ el card General settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not too much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be changed and typ@@ ed as shown in screen photo .
just ask for in@@ complete information , so you are informed if information is missing for creating key@@ words ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the read of the &amp; CD ; to connect to the Internet , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is simpler , will start immediately to read the &amp; CD . this is easily connected to the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , can be changed easily . the directory or file name will change easily and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , you will need to use the select fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . however , this is more than 620 MB in order to use this . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the open mode , the two select fields have to be selected , at least the first card box is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is available for us . these are settings for the data request , for the call of the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the internet . how to know the system that data will get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set it all as shown in the screen image .
mode : we don &apos;t want to download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look at a mirror server in your proximity . on this way , the load between the computers will be distributed . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server as well as many fire@@ wall protocol 88@@ 80 standard regularly bo@@ oting , there may be more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit a CD ; data on the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings from screen photo . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously cut pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and coding ? the author knows it not , therefore try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you want to cross this , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored . if you do not have any space on another drive , the files will not be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
to enter everything as it is on screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances a little bit must be turned to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of production of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be er@@ ased in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this sample :
number of WAV files at the same time : using a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; this configuration will be used as a standard for each output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizing structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section it is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files . first , we will create a connection to the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for each spin @-@ up &amp; CD .
as we use a &amp; CD which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , screen photos show a little differently from the data for a &amp; CD . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually can be submitted manually , instead of sending them from the Internet . comments are pointing to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this sample is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done yet , now the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , such as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD was identified as audio CD , and can be identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then search the questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been collected from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and moreover , the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; you will select a window , and you can select the database entry , which is best suited to your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; manually select this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen image , select the title of the player in the first line of the &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not need to be entered in the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ c@@ ell per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of CD .
attention : after the successful call of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words begin with grand@@ children or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ rable remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up to the tab control settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of co@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
just select an entry that is obviously wrong with the style of the im@@ aging CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data is not available anyway . for more information , go to the Internet site of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . Pop or Ra@@ p for example are to find below rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Ed@@ itors appears and you can see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . just enter the titles of each case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and adjust the same way up to all the title data of the &amp; CD ; typ@@ ed .
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each row of a piece . just the titles are selected or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or set the button all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection read the read process , this window appears to confirm the confirmation . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track that which expi@@ res .
click on the tab for turning on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be shown in the left part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can you see if you are trying to work with a code which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have read writing to the folder for temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . to read and coding in parallel . note the status notice at the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of programming has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only thing that can be configured is the result un@@ clear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous expres@@ sions and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order is coded for the queu@@ e of the code . after the last piece is coded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x / 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; C@@ au@@ dio@@ des . if you &apos;re already familiar with CV@@ S , you can also download an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ package is already installed . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use the pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance like the program can be adapted to your needs if it once runs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different other programs , has many variants of settings . at the best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the first @-@ time start of the program , without any instructions before it should go out of this somehow empty screen ( mainly when the program is not running audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it going on ? who reads this , probably has started the program . it should look somehow like this :
one bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not use this manual . it is thought to be a first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; it is thought to do it . at least after the contact intake by the author . and if you read this , he agreed this section and therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange , if we managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid , is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he did not have some features , some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projectors , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved when it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of any MIDI channel by pressing the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the procedure used .
seat support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , KM@@ id starts the next time again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog where you can select the desired song .
you can also run a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows fail . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and use the button you play in the tool bar , select the entry to play from the menu or set the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one after another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece takes place , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive .
if you find that a song goes too quickly or too slow , click on the arrows to the left and to the right of tempo . to get back the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on space bar is like a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry break in the menu , thus interrup@@ ts the space button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use tex@@ tual event , other use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set the events that will be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you need to manually adjust it . if you are reading in the menu settings , you will automatically select the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the menu settings or song events on the menu settings . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these will be played in series according to this section , as you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . here you can find the collection of collection under the point .... Click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can select the requested information in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application , this collection is not stored . remember that if you add a lot of pieces .
in order to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collector manager . there , you can add a song to the button . again , the file dialog appears where you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of Autom@@ atic adding to the collection .
when Autom@@ atic adding to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using File Open or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically added to the active collection .
if Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click here .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menu , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ established .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right .
to jump back a song or jump , select the previous piece , select the previous piece from the menu or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be deleted . however , this does not matter if it is not stored in the aband@@ oning of &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that under@@ stands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( incl . AW@@ E - and G@@ US cards , FM radio and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you must process the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite file ) .
an MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required conversion for playing a piece of piece .
each section may appear only once , except for the K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , this is that every occurrence is a different text@@ ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be compatible for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section is given as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that GM Pat@@ ches are given in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that use this instrument to create sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . in addition , you will also apply the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
now , if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( tissue signal ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Tro@@ drum Patch of the patch is meant to represent a different per@@ cus instrument ( Dr@@ ums , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum means ( how some key@@ boards have ) .
the K@@ E@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 items .
you can define several key@@ words for each channel and each instrument you need to use only in the first line .
key@@ words are used primarily to form tones to the percussion channel . look at the key@@ way as an example .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , you simply do it just in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices require 16 channels , CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , set up following the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is used on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ cussion Patch on the Per@@ gol@@ fer channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio is multiplied to which the ratio of P@@ itch Ben@@ der events is multiplied with the value n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only forwarded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make no dec@@ imal number in the map file .
this setting is used because GM is to play a keyboard , which is to play a pitch event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards will try to play two sounds up to a octave up . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog for MIDI settings . you can find it in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the Channel view is a window with a whole number of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these occasions you can see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a certain channel . for each channel you can select a tool where you have changed a tool , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the sounds of the sounds . view the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed to play with which a song is played . the higher the number , the larger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . if you find such a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
an MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; in order to result the same MIDI file on two different devices , as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can not force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while using a mp3 @-@ file ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid . this happens because &amp; k@@ mid . without AW@@ E support it was compiled . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source code ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , activate the setting of Autom@@ atic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can use the arrow button on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . in order to restore the speed , you can click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; stand@@ still ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this mode I need to play an MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file , only enter the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file just once , without having to add them to a collection , turn the setting of Autom@@ atic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . open files
suppose that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . access just want to play the first file . so set the setting of Autom@@ atic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me that , further to &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid , was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study Mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ intenance ; Lag@@ a . at the moment , I &apos;m going to take a lot of time for my Hob@@ bies , but I try to catch a bit of time . when Hob@@ bies , I try to collect MIDI files , music and propositions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de.@@ org or ant@@ s@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file by a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should get in contact with me , as I might have the file perhaps already .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid , fully written in my free time and I don &apos;t want to make money to get money . I &apos;d like to empha@@ size that I only get more program@@ er because / if I get back messages from users ( postcards or email ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the error that the pitch is too high at AW@@ E @-@ cards .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing of the AW@@ E support , has Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magnus pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error message or only a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net which give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke @-@ files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ ht@@ ml . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke @-@ songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or a AW@@ E map .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it will then run as if you had a sound card , except you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ ine ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for MP@@ 3s , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from MP@@ 3s or ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD , or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; film name ; was not finished yet than &amp; k@@ de ; on this machine was installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear if information are displayed in it .
it is possible to pick up the preferred connections under the menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy . if you balance an entry , its group and all sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and the playback starts with the clicked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct edit of the XML configuration files . of course , you can select the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player , but also through the application itself . simply select the next processing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content will be displayed this part .
after changing XML files , you must choose the same with playlist , and select either the processing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode leave or a different group will be selected without the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ful c and Change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / clarity / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation during the start does not need to be short , it will automatically end through the opening of another source . however , this would be anno@@ ying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
an easy example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; runs ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; s ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ ole ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configur@@ ing MP@@ 3s in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here , the path can be set from the MP@@ 3s and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here , the output of m@@ player can be seen .
there is no riders for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ wi@@ c as the set of the back@@ end per m@@ im@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages have to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash flash in the dialog dialog box of K@@ DE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end edition is set within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , ph@@ on@@ on all og@@ g files should be used :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV cards , either using MP@@ 3s or X@@ Video ( this requires u@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV you need to set up the used device and the TV channels . this can be edited manually from the configuration dialog , or edit the configuration file manually .
to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog box in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port must be detected , of which one is selected . the need to be used ( e.g. is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can work only X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux the only running ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux has to be functional for the X server . this is why the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for the creation of graphical user surface areas and network support and is required for comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix style systems , it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; res@@ p . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the use &amp; Linux ; distribution can be included . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; cool ; -@@ Project contains some of the compiled packages of cor@@ k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow a simple installation without additional comp@@ ile and are included on the c@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is available for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ not ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding the documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation should be desired , the contact should be made via the c@@ ile ; -@@ website .
any questions or comp@@ ile questions come on or if desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; T@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; available in a graphic surface and within this one simple , direct and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; the easy to use , editing and troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin right with reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
for r &amp; lat@@ ex ; the correct answer is : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if it is difficult to operate , can also use a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is able to use a bit more difficult but more realistic demand that desc@@ ends from the re@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
given here only a good news about &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do so , for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Office Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the same as other gener@@ alization languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction to which the gener@@ alization features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text sections will be specified as well as possible with the instruction \ \ \ &apos; class , the creation begins with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Con@@ figuration } and must be closed again with the \ \ server command .
the fast @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for the rapid development of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( men@@ ue ) offers some folders for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related to the document .
documentation of the document : this will explain the type of the document : article ( 1 ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : hereby , the character encoding is set . modern systems also use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best should use UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used packages for r &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used with the preparation of German texts .
new users have now no worry about . it is a short description of the functions and further information are given in the section .
&amp; kiss ; in the same way as other source editor - the emphasis of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ correct ) is not closed . however , you should have noticed that some mathematical environments should not be closed . however , it is due to the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and over .
with the automatic loading process of environments ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { Command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatic line ( for entering the text ) and the added line to the closing of the command . this function can be set in the following settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; prove the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ met@@ ed element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective screen .
for the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files may be very helpful . once a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; Ger@@ a ) file has been created , jumps &amp; kiss ; by clicking with the average mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI file format contains a description of the format document and also other information such as the font , and also other information such as the font , or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and barley .
for use of the DVI @-@ file elements , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file with the editor has been clicked on the opposite section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked on the appropriate place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used for work with multiple files . using a master document , the work will be simplified using other embedded .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project management can be set to project settings .
quick structure : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there is no error in the source code ) .
note : in this mode the DVI @-@ file is to be found in this mode , in terms of met@@ ering - and there &apos;s no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece . after the quick structure .
in consideration of the working tool@@ bar the three large areas should be developed into the document . the first selection box is designed for the rapid breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box More is for inser@@ tion of articles , such as tags , Fu@@ Ã - notes or references . the applicable mut@@ ations are :
name : this command is created for a section , a picture or different element .
regarding : is used for reference to a fixed term ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote the selection list is displayed with literary entries . for example , if the file is necessary for a project . for example , the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files are also written in &amp; in ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for defining the writing of the font . it is possible to specify the fon@@ ts of the font . it can be set to the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection objects are available for creating a new document by selecting the document art and festival legend of settings . 2 . the document can be written down by reason of the reason .
the brackets according to the instruction \ \ \ &apos; class contains the settings for the command . read &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font color . if the font is set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source file has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex file must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way for this is the use of the state or the push of the button .
the source code must be saved prior to comp@@ ile . &amp; spare parts ; for storage , the storage is automatically generated .
if the compilation of the document failed , the log@@ ging should be searched according to the errors . if using quick @-@ construction and ey@@ ep@@ iece , this should not be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered .
a environment ( English ) is a text which is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font color is created . the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } , \ \ \ and \ \ end { Environment } , is to obtain the order of the font within the environment - to which the Ries@@ ig@@ â ( English ) is the same .
the changes will only be adjusted within the environment ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } to \ \ end { Environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the conditions within a environment .
there are many ways to illumin@@ ate the authenti@@ city and ease of authenti@@ cation of the document . for example , there are certain types of reading , fat pressure , courses , etc . these commands are either signed with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for intensive printing and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word can be displayed in a set with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ Rati@@ o : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ Beg@@ in { odds } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background given to the background of the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex site , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; cool ; .
once the Assistant was entered into a little text , a few adjustments should be served for the better reading of the document . these should be a quote , some places in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , a editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor . for an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or printed in a &amp; post@@ script ; / PDF file is converted . easy to try and fun .
DVI ; is a different file format ( e.g. D e V ice I n@@ 1 ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; post@@ script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are described as for the creation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar is the transformation of the DVI ; -@@ file in other formats . once the DVI @-@ file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion can begin converted into different formats using the tool bar in the tool bar .
the advance search for the direct jump from the editor to be added within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; spare parts ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ d files . for this purpose , only modern settings must be set up in the settings ... tools are balanced .
for example , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in one line of the source text and have to be clicked on advance search @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI @-@ viewer is then so@@ aked .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece , with one click of the intermediate button of mouse in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; used in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; set in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; used as text editor ( settings of ey@@ ep@@ iece ... editor )
if using the quick structure of the &amp; DVI @-@ panel viewer , an error can be given . if a mistake is given , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file descri@@ ped the error source in the source code . in the editor you can view the buttons before the error code . in order to consider the error code , the log@@ ging file must be clicked on the error code , the error message must be clicked on the log@@ ging line , navigating immediately to the faulty line .
once the respective button is clicked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears to be selected for the written template for the document . the default displays are :
when selecting a blank document , a document may either be re@@ written or used by the assistant to the fast preparation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
optional users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually used the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; cool ; created , stored and charged to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; -@@ file can be created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by an existing document and create a selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings are General .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which character strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically , they are used as follows : \ \ &apos; s class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ON@@ S $ $ &#93; { 5 } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and that therefore banned entries to the commands in editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps will be completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can be balanced instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex files ; a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps .
&amp; K@@ ate ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for r &amp; K@@ ate ; can be made directly out of &amp; made in the men@@ ue .
in order to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his testimonies should be attracted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be used directly with reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
&amp; cool ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ l@@ acked reference , which can be called upon the following commands of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
button@@ 1 double @-@ click on the button to compens@@ ate the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way to click \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ ger@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with a left @-@ left mouse button , the balanced text will automatically be copied to the intermediate position .
when using the arrow keys , you can relax parts of the source code in the ed@@ itors window .
&amp; cool ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source tex@@ ts and empha@@ size this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another colour .
many assist@@ ants are gathered together in the text . it is a kind of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ tioning are jumps on the jump or last jump mark . this jump mark will also be highlighted in the first input of a sign automatically .
the processing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although excellent mos@@ pher@@ es are designed , so many environments for writing by a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code are always ready for selection and groups , and therefore under@@ line your selection . among others the following commands are contained to the text selection :
a complete sub@@ section ( group of lines containing on both sides have a blank line ) . this extended meaning has been added to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only preventive thing in &amp; cool ; is that the only thing is separated by two blank lines .
has the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also extended meaning because this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with an extended star ( \ \ ) and a large star ( * ) at the end .
for the part of a part of the document , nat@@ ch can be removed first of this first . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ chain C@@ tr@@ l ; K with the whole line is removed . and with its own commands you can download it for a faster result . the following commands are included in the text of the text .
removes an entire paragraph . definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit extracts form .
it has already been clear that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; this is why it offers &amp; h@@ ile ; for n@@ f further orders inferior to work environment for a very good work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to reach the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is placed before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Sur@@ face } , the end of the environment is spec@@ kl@@ ed ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of rough environmental commands , you can quickly lost sight . this command will be close to the most recently opened environment , so that the surrounding environment is not broken down .
&amp; cool ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Be@@ verage Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from working environment .
this command is injected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the fe@@ ed@@ itary K@@ lam@@ mer .
with this command is injected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closed cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of welded groups , groups of stap@@ les can be lost quickly . this command shut down the last open group so that the swal@@ low structure of the &amp; tex ; groups do not break down .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple signs for the purpose is used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; the sign is used for two simple instructions for the purpose . and for this case , the sign is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two tigh@@ tening marks for lat@@ ex and lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry for the double ass@@ ump@@ tions can set up in a set of settings ... La@@ Te@@ X - and follow @-@ off .
it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. , n@@ v or French ) and thus German or French services . there are also many other languages available .
when working on Shift ; input button for a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a list area ( such as enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , is designed , not only a line breaks but also the command \ \ item .
the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; cool ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ line settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users found the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) each other ; seek &amp; c@@ ile ; after the sim@@ pl@@ est table in the dar@@ kened line . although this tab@@ ulator is not allowed to add and c@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns is added to the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already a good source code case has been extended ; in order to build special commands ( mostly for r &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) it has been built for n@@ f different modes . all these modes can be set for different working modes . all of these modes can be set up for different modes .
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Sur@@ face } is plug@@ ged ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Sur@@ face } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the button bar is removed , the last letter of the input will be removed and can be changed . on the other hand , the list can also be dimin@@ ished by entering a further letter .
all orders are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you will have to be installed in selecting a command . alternatively a jump to these positions is possible , and you will have a jump to these locations by allowing you to be frozen to these positions .
with Settings ; set up and set the settings of these lists . it can be used to treat different exercises for free &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions as well as possible decoration of the general language @-@ used adult .
the command mode is to be entered for the ful@@ fill@@ ment of environments . it is always used to have a large list with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the complete mode is used . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for implementing environments .
when entering the full @-@ period mode , the command is automatically installed and the key is automatically installed and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the surrounding process can be continued to the sim@@ pl@@ est way and then can be stopped by pressing the input button .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a common room environment , it is even a first \ \ item command to be installed .
with Settings ; set up and set settings on these lists . this mode uses the list of default value for sale mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; spare parts ; under@@ line custom lists of ab@@ outs that are immediately replaced by l@@ yp@@ ed strings . for example , the lists can be set up under settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l which is included in the example of entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word has to be fully implemented , then the key L Str@@ g + Alt Space is introduced , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large numbers are not helpful for automatic dec@@ eption . however , it was found that many whales are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; c@@ ile ; the ful@@ fill@@ ment for all already written lock .
this mode can be set up in the following settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ ification can be scre@@ ened . here , the threshold value can also be specified for display of the completion .
the fully functional files may be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / Complete / pack / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / s / s / Complete / / person ( ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary puts it ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog for graphics is designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to present the basi@@ cs of the basi@@ cs , the sections and sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but they offer excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is reproduced , the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then converted to a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the job , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the state of creating comp@@ ile , create converting and create view .
for the compilation of the source text for viewing angles such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the other conversion can be used with Alt ; 3 the DVI ; -@@ file is converted into a PS @-@ file and can be used by pressing alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command line , a viewer is normally called to comp@@ ile after the compilation . should no problem be used , every single window will be changed once more .
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... In case the following information is asked for the project :
when trig@@ gering the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be given from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; @-@ valves ; allows the ext@@ inction of EC@@ MAS@@ cri@@ pt -@@ Ko@@ en . the scripts can be administ@@ rated in the vertical glue .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in further versions of &amp; valves .
first , the first must be said that the configuration environment of the scripts in &amp; is ; a systematic object ( = c@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ covered system in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of large packages . offers a lot of different help to under@@ mining the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ ts ; are supplied with many documents . there is a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
it is not only for a full description of all programs ( but a few key pack@@ ets are described ) but rather , it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document because it is a very large document ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tures ; the Find the correct document is not always easy . / tex@@ tual help , the little application is tex@@ tual , which contains a database with all of them ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the green advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . of &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the subject of space . click the viewer for the document .

the plug@@ in system , the &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; possibly have little to do with &amp; quantitative . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can use the desired functionality in &amp; quantitative ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements can be found further below .
to install a Plu@@ gin or a K@@ Part , let &apos;s start with the menu plug@@ in . this means that the following dialog can be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins listed and add new features . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search engine . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several people work together in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship one to another . &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; supported by team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties tab .
the name and email records are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as Team Leader as well as Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can look out from the list of Team Members which he is . this is done by pressing the team member from the list and the s@@ me@@ ar button as expresses . the currently selected member ( its identification ) is fat after you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information about ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage through the capture of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team manager if something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something particular happens in the project . an example would be the record of the opening and closing of the project , such a file would be secured or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project settings can be created , edited and deleted .
an e @-@ mail will be sent to the addresses mentioned in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ sat may be a team @-@ or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i such as the ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can be chosen either by a note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a commentary area followed by Con@@ text text .
notes can be sent to a certain determin@@ at@@ able member of the team . in this case , the nick@@ name of the team member states or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , a role in the project from the following ways : team manager Sub@@ project Director Sub@@ project guides , should be given in the following examples or sub@@ projects as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roles are independent of large or small show , but spaces around the brackets and the : do the note in@@ valid .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nostics and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing languages are supported .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Quant@@ a ... called . this dialog extends over a few pages that will be treated in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car , may be changed . entries are :
large / small scale of tags : large / small cl@@ auses of automatically applied tags . normal large / small cl@@ auses means that tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small selection of attributes : large / small cl@@ auses of automatically added attributes . normal large / small cl@@ auses means that attributes are inserted as inserted into the daily XML files .
optional tags include : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately following the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as stated above all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic transformation of acceptable characters into the corresponding encoding during the type of use .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ ypes for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Standard , the default values can be recovered .
standard character encoding : the coding of new or in other way as with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be over@@ taken ) , but this setting is em@@ itted by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . but this setting is em@@ itted by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copy , so that with a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can be recovered . this is not the same as storing the file . this is not the same as storing the file . even for not stored documents , backup is regularly created , according to the set time created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ el ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation that preview and the source code simultaneously .
set the window settings at the next start is useful if the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / dependent views to each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ een @-@ layout parameters .
the warning messages range serves to the taxes of the possibility to retri@@ eve the display of war@@ nings by cont@@ ests of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text in shared mode . in terms of different modes see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structural tree click the following action , it is possible to change the promotion of the structure with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of knots of tree can be opened automatically as deep in a change in the structure tree . empty k@@ not are empty areas in the text , while empty groups such are not found in the current document .
the range of ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded for extensive text . ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations are divided into groups , each may be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; this means it can be a valid group of PHP in which the i@@ f@@ law is slightly different means than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cri@@ pt .
here , the plug@@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third side that can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ able application , most of the best @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be given the following :
address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it &apos;s not located on a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is transferred to the plug@@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project ord@@ ner .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in refuse to load the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load when this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test &amp; quantitative information ; if the specified information is correct . select the use of the application even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
in version 3.3 , the error search was completely re@@ developed . Die@@ supports for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as the support for D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quantitative ; inser@@ tion .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ in in the project settings . using the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plu@@ gin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative description ; -@@ user interface :
a view , displayed in the content of clear variables . usually appear in the left dock .
a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed , usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger is shown . it appears usually in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bug@@ gers everything is available , or a part of the following functionality .
this action is required for de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or it forks the plug @-@ in with , at debit card . this action is activated by default , which is used by a de@@ bug@@ ger that must not be respected in normal case .
the counterpart to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger or finishes the lu@@ dge according to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to server a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the list of de@@ bug@@ ger issue .
tells the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the scripts and the currently running line continuously . if this happens while the script is continued , the execution occurs when a debit system was started , the script starts with the requirement .
tells the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information about to over@@ watch variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is given , the execution happens once a request is placed .
the de@@ bug@@ ger performs the next instruction in script , without entering into the functions or include .
the de@@ bug@@ ger performs the next instruction in script , but if possible , it is fixed in functions and include .
follow the de@@ bug@@ ger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there wouldn &apos;t be the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be monitored , which should be monitored . the over@@ a@@ woke value appears in the Vari@@ abl@@ ation view .
with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; quantitative ; to adapt to your needs and how to help you &amp; quantitative ; help to get better .
documentation type E@@ dit Package ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative information ; to provide support for mar@@ up@@ - and scripts themselves as well as &amp; CSS ; enable your simplicity and flexibility making from &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly and IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and day XML files containing image buttons ( above the edit window ) , the text and instructions are faster to insert in a document than a user ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how tag@@ ging XML files are to create , then the form@@ at@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . shortly , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ res@@ eller , the &amp; quantitative file ; this file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; itself . tool bar allow quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folder are not as folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day XML files . tag folder bear the name of the describe @-@ language and version , so present . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML to and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all possibilities and limits are explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains no one element above itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the Type Method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attributes and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a mere element of element .
describes a attribute on a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . in addition , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element of element element .
specifies the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor and attribute on the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p &apos;s name within &amp; quantitative name is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a ker@@ f and a name name . the arguments that can be handed to the method . can be empty or % daily name % , that means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day placed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for a attribute description . it is only element element element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags inside a dialog . this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
is the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be available for every field in the dialog ( e.g. a for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is a mere element type .
is there a list of elements that will end one day . this element is a mere element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not work , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog at the top of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; -@@ windows to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is not yet available for loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file should be schem@@ es .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this day XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load type = &quot; ) &quot; re@@ load type = &quot; -@@ string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed via D@@ TD Be@@ am D@@ TD ; this means that di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative information ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can set up action with Settings ... created . click on New Action to the same dialog :
this action has been assigned to this action . by clicking the User button , a key@@ boards can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current keyboard cuts are aw@@ k@@ able .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that you can modify or enter the document ( or parts of the document ) ; even the quick release dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be indicated . for example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ile variable in the command line , such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ a / scripts in the script : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / scripts / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable , which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; process . if from &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative information ; from the external script it is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the name name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script input of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us can take advantage of the standard input . in the selection box input can be determined , which is to send to the default value . options are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input can also be re@@ directed the output . there are two types of issue : normal edition , on the standard issue ; error messages , which should be done on the standard output text , which is to be adjusted to the standard output text by which the value is set in the box issue :
if there are many tags in the aw@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the present case it is not too many , so one can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
once a tool is added , you must add actions and configure action . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts working mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the same day to the matching tool .
complete all and if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , activate Dialogue &quot; Day &quot; if available , so that a input when using this promotion is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ ia ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ ia ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size others .
please note that the created icon does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as un@@ parall@@ eled , further interpreted ) , or should at least notice a message to the user that clicking this symbol will be a &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol there must be associated with the action . this happens via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags so that &apos;s what you are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quantitative data ; functions for tool@@ bar add or it should set these for better overview by some tr@@ ench into several groups . do you open the tool@@ bars dialog for Settings tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element it should be added to the tool@@ bar to the right , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to use a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator does not support groups . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button on the opposite of the button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back to the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML did not exist , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the chosen extension of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the script or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like to like . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search an existing documentation for form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second deal we treat here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ ht@@ ml Section 2 = Section 1.@@ ht@@ ml Part 1 = Un@@ c@@ 1.@@ ht@@ ml Part 1 = tag@@ 1 ht@@ ml tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2 ht@@ ml tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml Part 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ ht@@ ml
the tree line defines the visible part of the documentation in the document @-@ tree . for example , you can see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 : PHP 4.2 , ... Intro@@ duction = Meas@@ ure@@ .@@ ht@@ ml ... Language Reference = Basic Case , ... Basic Case = Meas@@ ure@@ .@@ basic syntax = Meas@@ ure@@ .@@ ht@@ ml ...
please note that the # before G@@ etting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . that shows that it is a sub@@ ordin@@ ate in tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess training ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents can be refer@@ enced to a file ( and resol@@ ute at the top end of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; resources are replaced .
the section of the section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which should be displayed on the scope of a &amp; PHP ; scripts in context of the functional name and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connecting lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and save in accordance with $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Organ@@ izer / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / Organ@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these well and worth are to be shared , please send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quantitative birth ; -@@ repository . they will not be rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bars with actions , scripts , scripts ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email input , like D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; quantitative users can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them as correct and usable for the release . in order to make use of a full post that is ensured by G@@ PG / P@@ GP keys , for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys to enter . in the dialog new resource , the input fields have to be filled blank . ( URL points can be blank ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started .
the up@@ loading can upload by the D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) tool , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
after downloading of a resource , even before installation , exam@@ ining &amp; quantitative information . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; but the creation can be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files may be required in the day XML format . there is easier way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD shop and conver@@ sions of a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
target record name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Do@@ ct@@ ype Defin@@ itions line : the character string , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / h e.@@ d@@ t@@ d will appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP according to conversion : if enabled , produces &amp; quantitative ; according to the conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and full use of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; this chapter is to be able to bring them with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and quantitative .
in &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is selected as global , is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; quantitative ; this enables the group of administrators to secure various materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development aid for a single user . these are custom samples and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this may be easy to work with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which provides common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; -@@ MDI ; consists of some main areas : the ed@@ itors window , the builders , the ant@@ ei@@ v@@ ites with information and the tool@@ bar . please strike in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document set to re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ orial Unit to another context menu regarding the processed documentation , such as basic handling steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , using the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string is called a file using the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editorial office , the tool@@ bars of the editor will present itself ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; quantitative parameters , the tool is adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you insert one single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then enter the symbol that the tag represents , then you can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert a day that has several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill out various fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ ometer ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information to &amp; quantitative ; to navigate it to and pass through . in the presentation of Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites are available for files , project , sample templates , scripts , scripts and documentation of construction purposes .
project management is a powerful tool designed and quantitative tool . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , up@@ loading or delete the files from the memory medium can be carried out with the text menu .
another option of &amp; quantitative is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on how they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more about templates can be found in the project .
here you can find information about the available scripts . click here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , more functions are available , such as the script to edit , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of an element the cur@@ sor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element it opens up a list of commands in relation to navigation and collecting of the tree .
this tree appears among the other Bau@@ man@@ ners . with it can change man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . it is possible to change the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download your documentation for &amp; quantitative information ; the quantitative documentation can be downloaded from the quantitative documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the bottom of the window can be reached via the usable information : the message window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about each in Quant@@ a running script . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document are displayed , and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this cart@@ el re@@ ites shows all faul@@ ts in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , provide all error messages ( such as it gives ) to this window .
the &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command . the tool is the possibility to define their own orders as icons in &amp; quantitative .
a further function of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; quantitative ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; quantitative ; -@@ files to your system . in order to get a complete list of options that can be given to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; cr@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check whether your path does the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of its bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; quantitative mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative is not far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should define it &amp; quantitative ; for this , the suitable &amp; IDE ; for that .
well , to the above @-@ mentioned claim must be noted that &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ er is not only that everything else developed ? thanks to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ ours is not only this everything possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; enables the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity continuously . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars , the automation can be almost every task . by means of the program Kom@@ ar , you can realize them &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us . ( find out more about it in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web @-@ development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and has been expanded quickly to a highly @-@ engine@@ ered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative , Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; the original developers left the GP@@ L license version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details related documentation is with help : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or co @-@ center help : / quantitative a ) .
&amp; quantitative is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de.@@ org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de.@@ org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file which is not located on it , with the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all the files as template for later use . check out in the section about templates . should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project licence file , only a mistake is reported .
converts this special characters to &amp; HTML for inser@@ tion , so that it can be displayed correctly and not to be understood by the browser as a form factor .
converts the text from the intermediate position in &amp; URL ; -@@ friction , which is the correct way to insert of special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ tion of &amp; URL ; s in the anch@@ ors day .
switch the block @-@ selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
direct to a line number . that is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can be found !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ger .
- and switching on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to bookmark the bookmark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing in the menu with entries predicted or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searched the project directory to new files that could be there . this enables you to copy video files to your project folder or a folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have another input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
att@@ entive settings , such as &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; quantitative ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find the details .
loads a tool tool@@ bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu when you assign them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions need to be added through tool@@ boards or you will be asked if you are asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this del@@ etes it not from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
so you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quantitative point ; -@@ Team so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool bar as an app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading tool bar to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; which you have made or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; quantitative image ; own PA format .
load / refresh the Ent@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the actions from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is necessary to renew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this global is globally and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags which are loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allow access to the current day application dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ lines .
activated or de@@ activated the smart settings of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quantitative is denied by tool bar if this day is contradi@@ cted this place at this place .
the available plug @-@ in menu includes the available plug@@ ins below the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on the link . click on an activated plug@@ ins .
select the tool@@ ing mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ mits is based on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
select the type of line labels . very useful when you know people to use other OS platforms to developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external use T@@ id@@ y .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . through some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can cause the switching mode , which is also the default mode , or the lower window mode , which is the representation in &amp; quantitative image ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes one entry for each open window . the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or out .
changes in this dialogue includes any application which use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web brow@@ sers .
jud@@ ging the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; please find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add which you can change the sequences .
this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with each open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative form ; -@@ development in financial form , you find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up at the best from top to bottom , as the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file is automatically completed .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative file ; -@@ Project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small book letters ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the machine address of the machine where you want to remot@@ ely access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the chosen log file are used . depending on the remote computer , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the template for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects should be used , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files for different projects should be used , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folder may be selected .
this setting is great when you have static web content you want to download and change . if you want to download and change the script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed .
if the files you are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started to start new , do not shar@@ ks .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of expertise .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by att@@ aching or by removing the skins , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be uploaded into the menu with Project Properties in the menu window profiles , or with the key@@ boards Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are re@@ ignored in project operations such as project ord@@ ner .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view that will be loaded when opening the project . in case more about project int@@ entions can be found .
this means that the desired de@@ bug@@ ger can be selected . more information on G@@ ub@@ ed is to be found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in case the error search is described .
in the window profiles can upload high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile by drawing a profile view of each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be edited , edited or deleted , as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the Lower window event , one can turn the event actions , change or delete the actions , if a particular event happens , such as the example of a file . see in the details pane .
by default , &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not possible to influence .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu Project or the icon Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog box will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file is automatically stored . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project .
there are free access to the files in the project . there , the files may be managed in the current project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder behaviour as well , however , you will need to open the entries and open the context menu with the right button of the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can find various profiles . the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files . see .
allows removing of the actual profile . if only a profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing the removal .
the password will retain in the core memory and forget to program . this opportunity is useful if you need to save high up@@ loading files and save the rather un@@ safe password on the disk option does not occur in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative boards , many high @-@ scale profiles can be uploaded to different servers . when working or create a profile , this dialog can be displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a full qualifying domain name or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this needs to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxi@@ ety threshold , this is either a time saving feature or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can not be read easily , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be uploaded into a project many views , i.e. by simply diving of view , various files and tool bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar .
views can be saved in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting the adaptation of &amp; quantitative ; to your own working mode .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; best on the tool@@ bar . use and add adding . adding tool bar will be treated at the bottom of the tool@@ bar section at the bottom of the tool .
the tool bar and symbols can be adjusted either by the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which you can adjust other actions such as tool@@ bars , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar can be displayed , which should be indicated in the dialog where actions are to be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
in addition to the context of the context menus for a tool ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will be removed and the action will be displayed and the self @-@ explan@@ atory are displayed .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up the tool@@ bar in the menu with settings ... and set settings ..
templates are in essential docum@@ ent@@ ations , code @-@ escal@@ opes and files to link . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system available existing directory in the storage space . templates are set in &amp; quantitative ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative software ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template prior to use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; bin@@ aries are normally inserted in documents with inter@@ link ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template area below global templates . further information on the template &apos;s tree is available .
documents may be of any text documentation . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es work in such a way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template room under global templates . see for more information on templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be added in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Jav@@ as@@ cri@@ pt or Perl basis . some examples are found in the mounting space under global templates . see for more information on templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for all websites as template . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; quantitative .
create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template ....
once this is done , you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project document ) the template is not visible in the repository . check in the repository space under proj@@ ectile .
select text in your document and then click File As template . alternatively , select the selection available as local / project document . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and placing on the template templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy in a template @-@ folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and fold or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can choose the file tree or in the project files to create a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is secured by default , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
proj@@ ections allow a very good @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and head@@ lines , or create dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can insert some things on using templates , in projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the lower window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / apps / apps / quantitative / to@@ a / template and the template . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers such as explained above .
in order to define the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or template . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as the attributes can be inherited .
this is activated by default and does not fit everything except for pedi@@ atri@@ um . if a regular folder would generally be de@@ activated , except they would be explicitly activated . in case of normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;re probably in a family folder .
allows previous or below text for templates in this folder . this might be general head@@ lines or lines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a complete presentation by using special head@@ lines in a folder with a special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , you have an context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a full control collection for adding folders , or copy and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ it@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor will replace the source editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second , the ed@@ itors window in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he will load a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and check if necessary to the source code editor , in which they are visible in the source code .
in working with V@@ PL , editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL , editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , is still necessary to edit the code editor . there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are displayed in the source text editor and the C@@ ursor in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is activated , this mode is already active , the key pressure is the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , where the position is preserved in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source editor is adjustable via Settings Quant@@ a .... According to your choice of V@@ PL ; it can be set automatically between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small range for quick computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the processing of invisible tags at work with V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this means that the reduction of the hands of the hands can be changed .
met@@ a tags allows the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. key@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of the content , e.g. key@@ words in the column name and key@@ word keys key@@ word 2 on the contents -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way of the design of the design of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete it . a change on the list is exactly like the met@@ a elements possible . the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling device by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of cur@@ sors is as in a text processing , possible due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is unique . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by inser@@ ts and be deleted using remote control or removal times .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way as the source editor , as in the source text editor . it is necessary to note that the inser@@ tion of tags already existing identical tags are not removed , such as a anchor @-@ day , surround with text , every other surrounding anchor must be removed .
some tool bars such as tables assist@@ ent or the Listen @-@ assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will work in this release the tables or lists tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analysis of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , search for certain elements is possible and the design of the styles can be pursued .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had correc@@ ting the settings at the same time . another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts to merge .
the program used by me showed me only the altered lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the obj@@ ection was changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in one line and changes to white characters . later , any number of useful functions were added later .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , you can copy it easily into the intermediate window and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ contained file browser .
also 3 @-@ way inter@@ actions are fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently from each other part of a piece of coding and displays changes . in this editor you can even edit the outcome . in this editor you can even edit the results directly .
&amp; # diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the exact differences are similar to the possibilities of this color monitors . if you often have to check the check , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines are shown only in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the Sum@@ m@@ ary in the column on the left side . ( no anno@@ ying more , if a certain one changes the one . )
when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicate that file is different . red color means that both files may differ .
if all the files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can complete the ti@@ pping work by simply write the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder cran@@ k@@ diff@@ 3 folders 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folders
the opening dialog allows manual inser@@ ting of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection over the file browser ( file ... ) or the select a last open file . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be carried out .
through the button folder ... you can also select a folder when selecting a folder when a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
if connections are connected , the input field is active for the purpose and you can process . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving .
the single button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the intermediate position into the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison starts immediately . in open @-@ dialog you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the button button .
you can also use pulling and finish : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ative window .
what thought is behind ? sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to figure out what these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would need to copy two corresponding files , then paste them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can easily copy the relevant sections , insert and compare it .
note : at the moment you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the skins of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some ed@@ itors interpret the pulling and pick up text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case , your original data could perish .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( please note that Windows C is optional ) . ( if the path leads to a file , let the mouse give a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three source flags are the letters A , B and C assigned to the three sources . a colour is blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , the color file distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in Settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text , the column shows the corresponding color . with some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that divi@@ des the merge column by the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is activated , the line will be picked into broken lines .
the result window ( below the reference windows ) also has a info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; the changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains the automatic inter@@ actions already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next dissolved / un@@ ks conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isions can be used , each difference is also to be solved by a conflict that has to be solved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . ( this will also be a jump in the position inside the windows where the group is not visible . ) This group will then highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes no further line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text will be displayed ; no line is displayed in the box ; this text appears either in the final stored file , nor in a mark you may copy and add anywhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge tracking ; however , if you copy such text from the result window , you will be careful with this function .
note : if when selecting the sources to ignore the numbers , or ignore Ig@@ nor@@ ms C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters .
navigates to the image , you can also use the keyboard , but you can also use the keyboard , right , high , down , side down , side , at the beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . click here to navigate to the vertical image bar .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section Com@@ missions and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous conflict . note that , and not automatically sol@@ dered conflicts has to be regarded as a conflict . hence , the conflict must be distinguished between sol@@ uble and sol@@ dering conflicts .
in order to copy the selection into the intermediate position , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , you will automatically copy the copying button and the manual copy drops . be careful with this option , because you could not over@@ write the contents of the intermediate situation acci@@ dentally .
Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . UNIX versions use a line @-@ up character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line @-@ up + Ze@@ il@@ en@@ fe@@ eder \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line settings of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the last used files will automatically be stored and restored at the next start . ( menu Ad@@ just@@ i@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a writing with fixed width . ( on some systems also the dialog box with variable width on the selection , you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sive let@@ tering . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be ger@@ ast@@ ically shown . in these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences will automatically create an od@@ d color .
if this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the table button . otherwise , a table character is inserted .
if you press or press Return , the back line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the middle shelf . the manual copy into the intermediate position is then removed .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used .
at the same of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all complete identical lines are to be found in the source file . only during that first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white characters . in this step white characters are not ignored . white signs will not be ignored .
some ed@@ itors ( on some systems ) save a car switch &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line pre@@ ference &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you could adjust files with different sizes on the side , but then you may be treated differently with different sizes . during the merge this option is disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters are ignored . in the results , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intense after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in automatic @-@ passing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next ung@@ ar@@ est conflict is progres@@ sed .
sol@@ ves automated all conflicts in white signs by the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection can also ignore the numbers or comment on numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ig@@ nor@@ ms C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and implementing a merge . look for details under documentation for the list of documentation and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this is deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . this option does not affect the current current program . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; terminate and re @-@ start to change the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally above the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top settings will be used for all entries .
about the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice that is the local coding . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has for you purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files with different coding can be compared and combined .
if you have edited a file , you can define what encoding can be used to store .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files may not be Unicode , but the previous command command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) .
turn this off to supp@@ ress Her@@ vor@@ ings of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this applies also to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore the numbers or add Ig@@ nor@@ k@@ C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may see only the differences between two files . after selecting from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is indicated by the normal still a second over@@ throwing column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space available on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
specify the comparison chart next to each other . this can also be useful to ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and decide how to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start the merge command , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will first be delivered to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command itself is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example , to cut @-@ off parts or correction it settings .
when reading a file it is specified firstly to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the command of the command is only used with the line code . you can write your own bonus processor which meets exactly your requirements . every input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to enable user more flexibility when setting the diff performance . however , an external program needs , and most users don &apos;t want to program itself . however , the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
the \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key@@ words to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern by default : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experiment@@ ing with SE@@ D , you might need to understand it and perhaps you may even use this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar items .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line settings . SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi .
sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements from each other . for example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ror / switches &apos; allergy is required at per@@ l some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs only ( and ) without the previous &quot; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal pre @-@ processor are retained for viewing and merge . the further operations only change the data , which sees the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the Ze@@ il@@ en@@ ab@@ o pre@@ processor uses the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as a input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or hidden differences , you cannot notice certain differences in particular , and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder stim@@ ulating and merge .
... for each object a proposal to merge ; you can custom@@ ize the suggest@@ ion before start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and displays the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really perform ,
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ ative and merge of individual files . you need to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically . to start the merge , select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow ) .
during the reading of the folder you will be informed of a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files are listed , which were compared to that .
when the scanning process is completed , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder was found during the scan , click here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally displayed together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double clicking on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sign@@ atory valves and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open or folding all folders .
when you click on a file , the file extensions will start and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the data type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the contact clock action cannot be chosen automatically . if the coupling is started , you will be informed about any problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colors are red , green , yellow and black in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their total content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders the age is in@@ significant for its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C have not the same data type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory dat@@ at@@ ypes . as long as such error objects can exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same data type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory dat@@ at@@ ypes . as long as such error objects can exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explicitly defined target folders are specified and if the option directories synchron@@ ize directories . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 select the necessary action , so that later both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : bringing together and save the result into both folders . ( the user can see the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not eradi@@ cated , the merge command cannot be started .
while bringing a file to the other . status column shows Fer@@ tig , if the merge operation was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected happened , you should make a final review and see if the status is in order .
if in the setup dialog the file @-@ like method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these include the number of in@@ scriptions , sol@@ uble , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or linked together ) .
you can choose either the just selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all coupling activities ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the three @-@ file merge mode C will be used as a target to select B and / or B as a target when synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be listed in the destination folder . there are some options to ski@@ p certain entries in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to assemble all entries : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ note ) . to make only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if in contra@@ dict@@ ory data types still exist in@@ valid inter@@ actions , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can then select a valid promotion .
when you result list all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulating and ab@@ rupt .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the real changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then sets certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( a single file ) , then a composite window will open ( please note the screen image ) .
if you are ready to start using a file , then select directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a appropriate dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you want to continue to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been individually controlled , you &apos;ll notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries will not be stored in the current session . even if the merge command was not saved or not saved , these entries will be taken as fixed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will again be merged .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section named directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files which are fit onto the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . select the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ders . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ders . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pre@@ set is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many nautical files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be set using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems you have a prec@@ ursor point attribute . in other file systems a previous point is selected as hidden . this option you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element name or not . this option is switched on .
if links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if links to folder : if the option is switched off , the links how normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively sear@@ ches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recru@@ itment . a link to a folder signi@@ fy and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if this option is switched off . ) This option is switched off .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ uble , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate Anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , you may get faster , only the change date and the file size . however , this speed costs you make a certain measure of security . please do not use cau@@ tion . this option is shut down in default .
similarly as confi@@ dential date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical . that can be useful when copying the modified date . please do not use cau@@ tion . this option is shut down in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folders are selected . in this mode , the proposals will be selected , that later both folders are identical . the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is shut down in default .
if there are differences , there will be the copying of the newer file as an action . ( this is considered un@@ sure , because the other file doesn &apos;t change too . ) This option is switched off in any case .
if a file or folder is replaced by a file or deleted , then the original version is renamed . if an old backup file is already deleted , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies the normal merge of individual files , not only the associated whole folder . this option is switched on .
normally the file merge command will be visible into the merge of individual files ; you can switch to the window divider with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window divider in the window menu and switch between the directory and the text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file with double @-@ click . however , you can also convert a single file together without the folder . once you save the result , the status will be put on , and the file will not run again if you start the folder .
this status is lost , however , if you want to re @-@ read the directory : list of the menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders , which are located on local or remote computer .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you notice :
a path can be relatively small or .. . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder . then a file will always be used as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note the option to trust the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being used as a differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first in the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part file , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ user 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if no of the original files exist . Moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have been changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is comm@@ endable ) . Moreover , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result mer@@ ging the diff@@ 3 program from the diff tool utility collection .
I use GP@@ L programs already very long and have learned a lot from doing other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone this way or go on it .
you can not find the program compiled from the sources and the configure script in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you can find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are more than identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is differently , the line will be as the same as not the same . Not@@ to Each other , this is the same of this is the but this is of the case .
the editor remembers any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information will however be lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store these information .
the effort for this has been too large . you can re@@ produce a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to process bigger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly cooled ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; released and the text can &apos;t er@@ ase . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to produce differences . even more emphasis would be confused and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to be able to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 functions ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage .
a list of the last changes you can find under h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir is available to the folder in your system , where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Auto@@ conf and automatic make use , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if you have problems occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or envel@@ opes ) and delete the selected text . inser@@ tion ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switch In@@ sert ) add the text from the intermediate position at the current cur@@ sor position or replacing the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to rest@@ art the folder with the function updated . )
there are only entries displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folders do not already exist in the target folder . if the target folders do not already contains , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is probably changed in later program version ) .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the panel ( if they are already available ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktop spaces . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the work@@ space , its size to finish it or move it . this works both within an operating area as well as at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can show all virtual desktop space as well as in the current applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop area and to others .
with the medium mouse button you can move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a working area as well as other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only clicked the two entries of P@@ ager . however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on working area and end . the following commands be@@ have the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the working area . only appears when an application was clicked onto the application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when an application has been clicked onto an application .
if this check box is marked , window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved to the working area and can also be moved to other working areas .
when this field is crossed , you will be shown in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual space is displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual desktop space . it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with ordination , &amp; eg ; 1st floor space .
if this field is crossed , the background of each working area will also be displayed as a background in &amp; mu@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows at the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty space will appear to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; ball bearings can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal display shows all virtual desktop areas in a horizontal range , which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager miniature program in the control system . it has the advantage that it can display windows as icons or with its content and post@@ p@@ one . furthermore , it runs out of the control panel .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting from switch settings ... allows the dialog for Settings .
currently this can not be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually , manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ v . if you don &apos;t have a write permission to file the file or login to your system administrator . in this file , you have to register the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and assign to this one value . possible values are :

&amp; B is a screen saver . you can take a magni@@ fying glass for the cl@@ adding or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you &apos;re looking for a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window .. The picture that is indicated in the magni@@ fying window is a enlarged section of the screen and is described below as a select window .
in default setting , it is possible to display the mouse poin@@ ter as a mov@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can download &amp; k@@ mag ; add a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in extended windows , select the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window . please note that the mouse button is not able to recognize the form of the mouse . this is always the standard k@@ not ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the select mode , you can adjust the select window to your needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fication stand and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are in addition the &amp; Shift ; button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the select window . note that the upper left corner of the selection box remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; kiss ; possesses a lot of features . you can then send the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into a file ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
or starts / stops the update of the display . the stop@@ en of the update causes that the required CPU time is 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a select window will appear . the selected section is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; used automatically your selected short commands to store files , opening up a new window , printing , Ne@@ ul@@ ads ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and se@@ p@@ tic &amp; etc ; .
may also be known as &amp; a magni@@ fier ; if you are using a screen of screen , you can use a magni@@ fying area to view the cl@@ amped in a newspaper or a photo . this application is suitable for different people : from the research or artist until the web designer , or ob@@ serving .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse indicates a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( a repet@@ itive strain @-@ ring syndrome ) and for each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place as soon as the mouse speaks a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who are suffering pain due to the repet@@ itive strain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate it with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can hide the pain when using the mouse , and helping to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you should look back pain that use your computer with the use of your computer if this is not yet done .
in order to show it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool may avoid pain which occur when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain which applies through the mouse because of the mouse . the result may fall differently for each of the ergonomic tools .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supervised your mouse movements and makes a mouse click when you stop the movement .
if the intelligent move is enabled , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is done by the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse . in this way you can run the pulling out of the mouse button . intelligent shifts requires a little exercise but you get used quickly .
after the end of the mouse movement , this break @-@ time must be stopped before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
if intelligent move is turned on , the shooting time is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set . after going down the mouse button , before the mouse button lets you get rid of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on your right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow motion to the right and back . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes pool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the response time . open to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the Sound System and here . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value in order to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all the settings back to the values when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button users , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of users .
best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with pre@@ ferences . especially the intelligent shifts should first be switched off . if you are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the automatic mouse click , you can later set the smart shifts .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first you should make sure that places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on the browser window that does not constitute a link , does not lead to un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ les , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s normally quite easy . the trick is quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles you get into contact with the mouse .
first you need to remove the mouse . like this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be very clear if you watch the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the fil@@ tering and the contamination can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just use a wrong step . if you use this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean ; the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you are able to execute a mouse click . herein , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset ; back and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor at another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there , where you want to make it . but you can park your mouse on a neutral area of working area when you do not want to create a key mouse click here . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces are the tool@@ bar and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with smart shifts , but I do not create it to edit text .
intelligent shifts is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is highly likely to move it into the intermediate button or move into any other action , where you can only cause problems to prepare . but there are some advice to them :
do not use smart shifts when you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; set the text instead of a mouse click and hold the switch @-@ key button while moving the mouse button to the other end of the text and press the mouse button there again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button lets you play a sound like a mouse click . later , you can also use smart shifts without using the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
um &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be used , the X@@ test extension has to be installed for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case at most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers , and it is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter short . this program was developed for people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to those of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as a certain time that a pulling process begins to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , pulling and pick up with the mouse can also be carried out .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that m@@ ute users can talk to their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; m@@ ute users can speak the computer for themselves . users can choose from a list with the talk of the talk , that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the Assistant ( lin@@ ke screen photo ) , enter the command , which later is used for the language issue of text . further details will be found in the description of the user catalogue .
on the second side , select the Standard Text passage book . you can often choose the text settings if you need to type inser@@ ting . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right of screen ) , you determine the di@@ ction@@ ary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ies . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dic@@ tionary so that only in the right letters written in the Wor@@ ter@@ ies .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly structured and essentially contains an input field for the key@@ presses of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and the memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have a mouth , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken set will be attached to the memory . you can select that propositions which will be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; T@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two card cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ies as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box language issue , enter the command to enter the text box . in the selection box below the input field you specify the character encoding , with the text on the voice generator .
&amp; T@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to your voice generator is installed . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples are presented in the app@@ endix .
with as possible language service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ uses a standardized interface for speech output and which currently is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is reasonable , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection box promotion , after selecting a text passage , determine which action is triggered by selecting a text passage or through the choice of a text passage in the menu text@@ book or in the l@@ ath for text settings .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the selected text passage is inserted directly and additionally inserted into the memory . using the selected text passage , the selected text passage is initially entered only into the input field .
with the second selection box closing the processing window for Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can define whether the text@@ book book is automatically stored when closing the processing window .
with the selection of text settings book , the book is saved . if you select any changes , the text settings book is not saved . select before saving , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book book is stored .
the site of Wor@@ ter@@ ies contains a list of di@@ ction@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ ies . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a di@@ ction@@ ary . with this sel@@ ective field you can select the di@@ ction@@ ary of the di@@ ction@@ ary .
with buttons on the right side , you can delete di@@ ction@@ aries or add di@@ ction@@ aries , or export it into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the di@@ ction@@ ary .
for this source you select your desired language ; &amp; C@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ ines ; the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by number of tre@@ ach@@ ments . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org di@@ ction@@ ary to include only righ@@ tly written words into the new di@@ ction@@ ary .
with this option you can merge the available di@@ ction@@ aries . &amp; T@@ mouth ; ask then that di@@ ction@@ aries should be merged , and how this weight should be done .
with this option you specify a new , empty di@@ ction@@ ary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically into the di@@ ction@@ ary , create a di@@ ction@@ ary in the course of time a di@@ ction@@ ary .
the main range of the window for processing of text boxes is divided into two . in the upper part , the text boxes are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a passage of text , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key@@ note . if you have selected a text@@ book book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books or delete a selected text settings and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or a fol@@ dable menu .
the order of text pass@@ words or text settings can be changed with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the intermediate position . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise the selected fields of the running file is selected .
the chosen text is copied into the intermediate position . if in the input field a text section is selected , otherwise the selected fields of the running file is selected .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text in the input field is used , this will be used otherwise the selected propositions of the exp@@ elling memory .
if this menu entry is crossed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged by default via the processing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the left side and pulling the tool can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated when not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable vest can be displayed directly under the tool by default . by mouse click on the left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have set the command to set up correctly or not complete . open Settings to set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the language issue on the card @-@ language issue . ( see detailed dialog for Language syn@@ thesizer for further details ) .
Festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license allows to use the free Festival for free and to distribute without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the directory / usr / local / festival . the command to language issue is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a portable language generator . currently , it only supports the English language version . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and transmit without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line to set up the language issue , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the directory / usr / local / fre@@ ighter . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option is to send data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of ph@@ on@@ ies into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to break the text in ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the final character of the text , so that an additional sign has to be added ; therefore , the full command is therefore applied as in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / pet / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option data can be switched as standard input .
the language requirement of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which is available to all &amp; k@@ de . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it is currently used in order to support various language skills systems .
since the setting of the language terminal only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use as a language course as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ ie ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; T@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak , text through the calcul@@ ator . there will be a list already saved sets , which the user can always re@@ boot again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; n@@ ts ; - the language issue system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a project consisting of modules of existing service that allows each application to read the text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; n@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it presents a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with the applications of T@@ TS skills . users also offers interesting possibilities .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ ines ; -@@ applications are embedded .
the language issue is done via the program of data disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as the river , festival , &amp; etc .

in future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech @-@ service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
one module for the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / ) you can find the list of h@@ tt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ org / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also find in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de.@@ org , Channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; you need to install program password disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speakers are furnished , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or such as a speaker . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before you &amp; watch ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printer @-@ queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ el card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card is displayed . the speaker will appear automatically if you are t@@ onal and yet no speakers are set up .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application does not give a speaker .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click on the list , select a speaker from the list , and then click on the button to push the speaker on the list below . the order of the speaker in the list determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; paper ; system use .
choose a vote type , there are three male and three female voices , and a boys and girls to choose from .
if you click here , it appears on the new speaker on the map speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Finish .
now you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; already almost use it . go back to the card card and check if the T@@ TS service is plug@@ ged ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to read the text message ; please click on the card card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; please click on the card box General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; t@@ ts ; this start@@ up will be displayed on the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) and you can make text applications and read it . see . remove the mark , the K@@ TT@@ SD will hold and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is completed , runs &amp; t@@ ts ; further , if the field output is dis@@ connected ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears when reading is automatically in the system area of the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start updates , break , stop and start again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; or open a text file to open . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click on application or OK , then all modified settings will be applied to all sides .
the card card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , please click on the card box General and enabling speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check out the text that is read , and select the text message in the main menu . after a short time the speech output should begin .
it &apos;s almost always sense to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ ten@@ ure and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text displayed . check out the text , which should be read , and select the text displayed in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other applications is embedded , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; that you will notify you about fixed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; n@@ ts ; pre @-@ read .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set different types of messages . for example , you can alert you when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears where your nick@@ name comes back . with &amp; n@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C news release .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu settings of this program . here , the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on application .
filter for drawing construction provide a good way to correct news . this file is a good example . it is a good example . you removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that you send K@@ mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases when it is supposed to be assumed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed before it will be sent to the program disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improvement of the language to replace false words or ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations , a matching language and spokes@@ person or to deal certain defic@@ ien@@ cies of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ drawn to all other contracts . if the copy of the screen Reader is read , the requested orders will be continued .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important News such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the issue of news and norm@@ ative text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next stim@@ ulated priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of application that can be used . while you are looking for a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just enter the room . &amp; no messages are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text@@ books . each order you are used by the card card orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text applications . text applications are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular drummer .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ e , except the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the issue of a screen reader , while &amp; t@@ ts ; just such a reading , this issue will stop and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ arms , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter process the text and give it to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there may be more types of filters .
character sets shall replace parts of a text through other text . you can specify either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . it is used with pre@@ defined character sets such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from news &amp; conversation ; or &amp; @-@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to a different format . included in the scope of &amp; paper ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , you can send orders on &amp; paper ; if you have set a female voice on the card card , you can read the text by K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. more read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a language issue . if the filter does not show that its rules can not be found , the text remains unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification shall be sent through all activated filters which were set up on the page below . the processing of filters is made in the order in the list above down@@ wards .
this indicates the list of a fully operational filter . if a filter does not use it , it is not activated and is not used . filters are turned down from above down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and it will be displayed below the following settings .
for the installation of character sets filter , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a compar@@ ative pattern . if this pattern is found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large and minor changes will not be noted compared to comparison .
specify a name for your filters . you can choose one of these names , it must be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replace it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is executed in the displayed sequence from above down@@ wards .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , save the current list or delete a list of file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only used if the speaker for the text order is described here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is entered , the filter is only used if the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ end@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs are available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 is allowed , you may only copy .
the filter cleaning filter is only applied to the text if all conditions associated with an entry in the box of this filter . if all input fields is empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character sets filter filters provide regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no guide to the letter from regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs and add the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such re@@ form@@ ations . but it can only be used on well @-@ shaped XML . the help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environmental variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up to a certain speaker , or to a speaker with specific characteristics . you can define for example that texts by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filters is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the spokes@@ person , the selected text on &amp; t@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker ticket to be selected . with the speaker input filter , you can write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can call it with one click on the button to help help with the input .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to illustr@@ ate the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
click here the characteristics of the desired filter conditions . if the text does not meet the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to view the desired requirements at the right . click on the button to the right to show the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or delete all settings , or delete all settings .
the speaker input filter is only applied to the text if all conditions have to apply with an entry in the box of this filter when necessary . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech API , by &amp; k@@ de ; to add the programmer to their applications T@@ TS skills . applications are communic@@ ating with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD are added , such that syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the speech API below &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de.@@ org ) .
applications request speech output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program ct@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here text of text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will give .
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start @-@ up in a window , then t@@ t@@ rough in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ supply filter , but when using the module for the festival , websites are not pre @-@ read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so you do not need to do if you do not use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the surrounding variable P@@ AT@@ H program is required .
certain signs or inter@@ oc@@ ational characters seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thesizer , so that all propositions are ski@@ pped or only chew@@ ing b@@ loss@@ y . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the option is set to set the appropriate value for the appropriate language . if there is problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a character set filter . see .

the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , you can therefore refer to the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops ; for information which are not included in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want &amp; t@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the developers in connection with the developers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the source text of &amp; t@@ ts ; you can refer to the source text archive for k@@ de@@ met@@ bility or you have downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; check first , whether it works with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers properly . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription of the SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; Sha@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program is used as well as the program t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed further , that the setup of 2 @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is not possible and the script of the SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual propositions . the user may return - or withdraw , repeat the output or break down .
if an application is written on &amp; paper ; for example , if you have a spokes@@ person , it can be used for example a female English spokes@@ person . if you want to find a female speaker , otherwise the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to see more about it , you will see a spokes@@ person , see in .
if you click on the map speaker to add or on request , the card card spokes@@ man is displayed . as an example , the card card spokes@@ man is displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is displayed . for details on the modules you will find below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is contained to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . in general , western languages will be made automatically . in general , western languages will use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slovak . ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with this sli@@ der you can adjust the volume , talk speed and audio height of the synthetic language . if you can not select some controls and displayed this grey , the chosen voice can &apos;t be selected by you .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you check this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box can not be selected , you don &apos;t have a speaker up either ( or forget to click on users ) .
if this check box is marked at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window is displayed . otherwise , the icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . in this way you have the possibility to read or control it elsewhere .
here are all orders placed in the queu@@ e , together with the application which commissioned the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just worked proposition . the speaker ID equals the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can select a full purpose in the order that is selected in the list below , forward or return . ( but every order consists of several movements ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card card ) will be reduced and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to show the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en , click on the map audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information on news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
click here the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; t@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also
make the talk speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speed speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the SO@@ X program must be installed .
click on users to assume the new settings for the current &amp; desktop ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard .
on this map card you can set special action that will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be pre @-@ drawn to all other contracts . after the copy of the screen Reader was read , the requested orders will be resumed .
war@@ nings have priority priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issu@@ ance of news and norm@@ ative text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen re@@ aders , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is added to the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as the introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card are valid only for normal text applications . for news , al@@ arms and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to read &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy News &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; press the periodi@@ c and click on al@@ er@@ ts . the card @-@ card al@@ er@@ ts appears . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; t@@ ts ; reads no al@@ er@@ ts before .
if this setting is marked , al@@ er@@ ts where a sound is played , of &amp; t@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add any events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button add , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
all events , which are stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; to do when an event hits . you have the following selection options :
if you selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard choose the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the map speaker for top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a particular event is specified for a specific application , this is executed . otherwise the action is executed for all other events of the specific application . as the last option the action comes to carrying out the standard ( all other events ) .
the event All al@@ er@@ ts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the read noti@@ fications as follows :
use the button saving button to store the settings for al@@ er@@ ts into a file . the invited events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click on delete . all entries are deleted from any discrimination .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to select text for a language requirement . this standard contains stamps for the control of voices , speaking speed , the volume , the sex &apos;s voice and the pitch . furthermore marks for the control of the language requirement . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default voice , the festival used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#93; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Pap@@ a bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked me bear . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , the first sentence has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also start or terminate the card ticket orders , or start or stop off , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . at the first start of &amp; n@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a set of the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . you can change its settings or add additional Sat@@ is@@ limits filter , but will not be taken away .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est , you will learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying . switch on the card card orders , changing some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes . for this purpose , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; n@@ ts ; then faster with the reading can start , as only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long ,
you can then stop writing jobs on the card card or break , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal typ@@ ing filter filter is automatically set up when you run down t@@ rough access to the first time . it cannot be removed , only if you do not change this filter , unless you know what you do .
set the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter and add a tab@@ ul@@ atory filter ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ positi@@ onal borders ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the proposition borders automatically from the text . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal limits filter can keep the fon@@ ts .
the S@@ BD Filter will never be applied on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ g. ) , war@@ nings , messages or the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed from Ver@@ sions the normal Sat@@ is@@ limits filter , you can insert it again by load the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map Spe@@ aker selection , you can write the Spe@@ aker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard guide ( the top of the speaker card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speakers are specified .
use of the appropriate speaker , which shows all the characteristics of a furnished microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone ; otherwise select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker , which corresponds to the original properties originally introduced .
select the method to enter the desired data characteristics by clicking on a selection of the select buttons .
click here the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box , if the property is to have priority before other characteristics . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor at the stand , it will always be used as a priority feature . the only case where you may specify the attribute language , if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area of actors , to er@@ ase the table below , click on the selection button and then use the speaker , which corresponds to the following .

on your system there is the problem that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA , which can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions you will find on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice to the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr indicates that voice does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / t@@ festival d / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio , there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program SO@@ X must be installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ modul@@ us such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the Spe@@ aking speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( that is aware that the HTML 5 is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML inverter , and set the Spe@@ ach speed up .

the Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally well , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust the volume , talk speed and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help for this , you will find yourself in the instructions that are delivered with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , hence you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the dis@@ closure .
this voice uses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must choose to vote for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is normally contained in the &amp; Linux ; distributors are available as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Kyr@@ ill@@ ary , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . then , the festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ic@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ programme and mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; not complete voice output system . &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generates additional software in order to create these di@@ phone . festival creates this of &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; required di@@ ph@@ on@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found below .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; one module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; used to manage the network interfaces , rout@@ ines and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by a selection of K menu control center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; controller center ; to enable the user create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; displayed . the module network Settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a control center ; Internet &amp; network interface settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be functional and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device shows at all and allows setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices at installing and installed . network devices later added , the drivers must be charged with adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network interface is selected at the &amp; controller center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module network interface it tries to detect the used platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the hands can choose from the list , which corresponds to the distribution and release of the release . by marking the setting of non @-@ again questions , the setting can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings the option will automatically be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . in advance all the options are displayed , which means that the settings can be viewed . in the system management mode , you can click on the right at the lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces :
the settings listed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog mode to set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . pressing the button Extended Settings shows the dialog with further possibilities .
in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are brought from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required at each system start , therefore no further adjustment will be required . in the sel@@ ective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system can be selected .
the required TCP / IP address can be specified in the input field without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address is necessary .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option is not to be activated .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as characteristics of the device in the box list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . with ping at the &amp; console , you can determine whether the required address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your requirements . switching on the network device is activated by selecting from the list and view from the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . turn off a activated network device via selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net which conve@@ ys the physical link to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway is chosen .
a machine with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . that &apos;s necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the name resolution part of the rider name resolution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered change . DNS entries can be up or down in the list with buttons up or down in the priority .
when pressing the button Finish ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution you can add a DNS server . it will add the name of the name new name .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group computer on the name resolution , select an entry and then click the button Finish .... It will be displayed on the dialog .
the list is named as the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace DNS server .
normally the list is known as well known computers some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses support . this is still in the present version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator and click on adding .... The New Ali@@ as dialog box will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button Add . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several ali@@ as name , add the button add some times and add the other alias name .
select an entry of a name known from the list and select E@@ dit .... The dialog for converting machines will be displayed .
it may be one of the following tasks , then with pressing OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings used in the module network Settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the command must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ able .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the newest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm pack@@ ets ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and is available in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical surface can be used as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , development plans for libraries and other things are needed .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should make this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about fundamental network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Chang@@ ing configuration files are discussed .
this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been found great spread . IPv6 is expected in the near future . this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; this network is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can &apos;t be used as any case , the IP address can &apos;t be chosen .
when setting up a very small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific plan to avoid IP address con@@ sign@@ ments to the global network ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so their use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the mask mask is usually placed on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is needed for the IP address .
the power address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to one of the so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part you are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be dynam@@ ically modified at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised when in case of active DSL connections , another content is set to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE , is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config file . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for the quick , sel@@ ective equipment . the second purpose was the responsibility of a question that my wife introduced : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ read@@ out the band and reads the pre@@ ten@@ se information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the reader on the tape will not be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the reader , search it according to the correct index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ created .
if everything has been smooth , the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the tape is mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band .
before rele@@ asing the tape , first the integration must be solved , there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; through a change of symbol for the tape , that the integration for the band was solved and shows a message for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not match the form@@ at@@ ters at &amp; dat ; this process does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before you are form@@ at@@ ched by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape predi@@ ct , DA@@ T drives however .
after entering the band called and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after the formation of the form@@ ations , the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you &apos;ll need to select the to secure files . that can be done on three types :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is secured .
select a securing profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a hem@@ e . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right button of the mouse on the local file tree and choose the menu S@@ v ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box settings for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archive for the drive . only the selected file or folder was checked .
select the files in one of the archives in one of the archive for the tape . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
as soon as the test procedure has started , the dialog appears to check settings . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears over@@ checking . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can access the restore , the files that are to be recovered will be marked . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folders will be restored .
select the desired files from one of the archives with one block . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu .
once the recovery process has started , the dialog appears to restore settings . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears to recover . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process and the data transfer and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways from the band :
here is a securing profile with the just marked files and default settings . you can also make the following settings for a securing profile :
the current job folder where the backup should be carried out . the list of files to be secured automatically is automatically updated accordingly .
for all file that are listed under the backup files listed on the same file system , as the folder . folders , which are located on other file systems , you can enter separately under the backup files . each entry is considered independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files saved since then changed .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before the command of tar . this causes that all files will be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to the device file for tape drives ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path needs to point to the non @-@ re@@ ared version of the tape device .
is this setting active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted to the drive . in some drives this is necessary , before reading or writing operations .
if the option is turned on , tries and dat ; it may not work at the belt drive . possibly this setting is not working with all band drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape is un@@ mounted , automatically the tape is un@@ mounted . use this option not using Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is turned on , try and dat ; the hard@@ war@@ fare block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must report &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , you have to communicate the blocking size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is host name : seconds , whereby calcul@@ ating the full name of the system was form@@ at@@ ted on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the epoch .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / file .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be stored directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar , even other tar versions should work as long as it is not in mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewing for systems logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to control the various protocol files . additionally , allow &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; experienced users to quick access for example on any problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information on your system or where the system is set out the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; experienced users to access the quick access for example on any problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; therefore tries to al@@ locate some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol @-@ files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screen image , introduces &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file . the individual possibilities for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the launch of the system log log , first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol will not be displayed , so you don &apos;t have a small news window , so you &apos;ll find under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user no entit@@ lement to reading .
you can also filter the filter bar to filter after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the specified strings . in the default setting , the select box contains the select entry . in the default setting , the select line will only appear , if in one of the columns contain the drawing chain of the filter search term .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol @-@ search term , select the column process protocol and then enter the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; ks@@ haft log ; all protocol @-@ lines which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of stage errors are displayed with a noticeable color as protocol @-@ lines of the level notice . the colour display of protocol @-@ lines can be shut down .
if you want to view only certain process ( e.g. in system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command as for example to the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to activate new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new next protocol @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ f@@ ters . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub@@ windows . once you selected a window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; has its own website on h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ ysteme log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software @-@ software @-@ software . place you find more current information about reference sources of &amp; ks@@ ha@@ gue ; .
&amp; ks@@ haft log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program starts at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I don &apos;t want to go on to historical aspects ( among others , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it Bin@@ ary file is therefore under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone can try a machine on system V in@@ it without a new installation and new format . this is why you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of right in / etc . this folder called r@@ c.@@ d. place r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start using the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things such as set@@ serial , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use of it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see one line in the beginning area as the following :
at this point you can t@@ oss a glance into the second column and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can manually repair the in@@ it@@ tab changes . if you have anything through each other , you will manually repair the system and execute the following :
but how does it start to enter all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop system services ? very simple : each of the script is written so that it &apos;s a argument like start@@ up and stop . you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will stop with the argument stop . if he contains a S , the script will be called by the argument .
some people wish to create a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running Run@@ level , the only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not tri@@ vial : draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also change scripts between laps or change the position within one level by moving it anywhere else . this happens only then if the entry will be out of its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if you draw an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you prefer to move this into a new section . to select it only on a new run@@ level , you must choose from the context menu or add from the context menu and then in the target range settings -- even then , if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the promotion .
the sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you try to add the system .
note : there is no possibility to restore records that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . be careful .
you can use the table button to activate the various work@@ sectors ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous .
in order to post@@ p@@ one entry into another round level , use it into the intermediate level ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually , press the input key to switch between different fields . close the dialog button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to cast the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are taken to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; modifications to pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the Standard Run@@ ners , and now the machine starts up constantly . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services in these distri@@ butions , does not simpli@@ fy the configuration for proprietary purposes programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check whether all configuration files are available ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) just do without message when their configuration files are not available or set up false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you have to save it . either use the relevant icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry into the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user list list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears on the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have limited system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) , a card card will appear on which you can make individual settings , if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Unix .
the Ticket card password appears if shadow -@@ pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card is only appears where for at least one second file system limit ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ z@@ able at the quot@@ i@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem with space limit
the card groups are informed about the selected users of the selected user . the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the field of Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting this in large field .
the dialog box features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , add adding to the user or group or click on the matching buttons button of the tool@@ bar . the edit or del@@ e@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module , you can add the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager to remove the boot password , remove the time up to boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , change , change and more .
