<seg id="15">At & fsview, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. consequently, large files can be easily identified if they are viewed down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview, is an entry in the Treemap-representation a rectangle, which represents a file or folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either display depth for the slight detection of the disappearance or the image of any other file names like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>

Moreover, you can set the relative position of the label in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a rule, as a rule, the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this target will not always be met. please note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the division of a single entry is made for the subordinate entries, the implementation will be given. here it is intended for use and avoiding space losses due to always beneficial surfaces that are possible as square. the best methods on this respect are lines, columns or records.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a smoking pattern is drawn in the area of the overarched entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission. the camera can also be realized as a USB mass storage device (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digial came; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has a constantly rising number of over 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transmission of images of digital cameras to host and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos are generally large files and transfers via serial port are now fold. & digial came; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexrate support. the Exif support is required from some libgphoto2 camera switches to read the preferences. if the Exif support does not exist in libgog2, you might have any preferred pictures or the creation could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location. if you are enough photos of your date. if you want to take sufficient photos, then you will be able to use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export a folder for images you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, working hours, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archive and 5% work files and you will not want to organize your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of data types makes the stack processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a redirected picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the settings page of the metadata in & digial; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database by choosing the respective point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what you want? to do it & digial editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should select every photo words, labelling and evaluation. of course you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value then. you start the best with the rating or the leaderboards. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's go with keywords, keywords, as you are often called in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you have cataloged images from another source of embedded keywords, then & digial came; automatically inserting the tree to the right place. the changed keywords within the building is no problem and can be easily done by dragging a substructure to another. the changed passwords are being pursued by & digial; the changed passwords are being pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overthrown. this is a very rough representation, because each block of metadata is made of many sections. filenames and calendar data are of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool around your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to see most nibans your pictures simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details to see people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. Wow! you begin to dream, associations, the historical period of time is again present, you may even hear the silence. the label has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer, to help Him over the motif that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's okay, if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can use a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) as a label. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you are able to export your pictures into the label and / or the title of Web-Galeriesystems, you will need to tell the story so for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find out into another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train drives the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities the Geolocalization are already innumerable and can be taken into the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your travels with Google Earth. you can also view the pictures at the recording venue. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedom also applies in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information is stored in the setup page of & digial; as information, you should:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for activator and author): this field should be your name, or the name of the person who used the photograph. if it was not desired to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organisation can be used, it should not be changed. this field does not support Comma nor Semikolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autologation (synonym for authors of the author): associated with the author. this field contains the work drawing of photographers. examples may be like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memo to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the client field to identify who the photo offers. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations may be listed here. if the picture is a bearing picture, the group / agency will be given the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though these have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge of this problem is digital watermark. for individuals this problem is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important to this protection.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digial came; in the near future there will be such a module for pile processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, turnouts, power failures, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we're not talking about CDs that went on the road or a burning. these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negative. in this section it goes around problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data relocation in the world, has some interesting statistics that have a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs and you should not trust CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. of course you can also need CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece which is a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you believe it is in your measurgy.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can reduce good disks and good admission application. the best DVD recording devices are not more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable. so it's why you can choose the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very decent for errors, even if you have just written only. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the checksums. despite this massive protection, it requires chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, crater, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a well-effective program called Iso Buster that works wonderful works with CDs and DVDs. but also similar applications are not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disdisks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to save the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost 6 times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all of which has been said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good start to high-quality media in a non-quality format. read the media using a description, date & author sign and afterwards protected on a clean, dark dry and dry-protected area. do not forget to copy the data onto the next generation of media or software that can read the media or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for itself. their manufacturers guarantee include a new disk, but not the data. Google puts on this topic a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: floppy disks</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common fault rate, SMART cannot notice that error. some of the SMART pending error occurred. these are particularly reading errors and remediation count. the expected age time amounts to between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">Here it is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a power loss before you have secured the files, but these losses are usually allowed without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices are not lots of power, this can cause severe damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these anomalies can cause severe data loss, hardwareage, damaged motherboards and other defects. protect themselves before unavoidable, which leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that one portion of energy heat is absorbed and the rest is grounded. it is usually in the form of a slots. do not think that every slot also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a particular minimum of protection. you should also consider that it provides protection against lightning strikes and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage support which can also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protector protect your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting you, these devices can automatically adjust cordless energy if a power failure occurs. some models allow you to make sure that they meet the same quality requirements such as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifespan of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk to avoid your computer system and get his security at power problems with the cost to avoid these. one high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your calculator is using it. finally, you should always remember any cable before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux; Mac Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to save any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home, however much expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you have to send data on comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suited as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it's not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo Community 23hq.com is available on photos and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online. the professional variant gives you more at your disposal, in case of Flickr dramatically. for 25 $a year you get unlimited storage that should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large firms are included in the offer and are included in the offer. so they are desasterable.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transmissions are due to the transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs provide at least the integrity of data between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred. all of these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have destroyed a photo. it is quite troubled that there is no protection for it. no one seems to have thought about it. the internet with the TCP protocol is a much safer data way than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission errors because they generate Interpreferences within the data flow. these errors remain unnoticed at normal file systems.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not concerned particularly of transmission problems, you should see in the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes every year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates to be able to handle and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% for job systems. in case of notebooks this proportion is already the percentage of theft 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them think. it is currently limited to a lower damage as such as theft or reinstallments. and it is currently only limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. an excellent English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examination process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file was not saved before the problem arose, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is that while technology develops further, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and roughness of all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are going for compact cameras and the end result is too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive are now responsible for 100 & euro; therefore, you can do no one for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected according to a plan and test this backup before you make some dangerous like the reinstall of your operating system, replacing plates, or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning strikes you when the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget the plane crash: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole space or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterpreventive means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs to enter your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. this is a snapshot without History and represents a complete copy of a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: one backup of the files which have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: one backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. this creates several moments of snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time. this backup comes with a versioning system on the next with the exception that it is only constant and not continuously updated.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can easily set up your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference of files that have been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security above ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you plenty of time to discover and restore. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly penalty recording for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., Use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order that valuable images will survive the next 40 years, that is about the time period in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature is unpredictable. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to manage as a certain wax. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system are fully compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easy to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for any time. if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite easy: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the reference pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means that in fact, enlarge it means.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have placed the scalability with insert and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated record or partition. if you are using * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and store it onto a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Ds; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & Ds; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software any software you can read it, then you can create them yourself. this task is simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. but it can save much more. it is funny, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour duct and full transparency. PNG can use Gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color information but not as many as TIFF is needed and a slow compression. this format would we recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. it manages photos in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format. however, there is more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw material format. DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may possibly be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe is the XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. this is a label of XML and RDF. the file information are stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers take it before the original size of your recording, mostly in the raw material, as it can file the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may think about problems when using the metadatendatei and the image file, and therefore you should think to use DNG to use containers and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to support for fully compatible online metadata standards, discussions and community work in the DCMI-communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and connaissance efforts to achieve comprehensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images of the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are used on the camera ship, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digiplug; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off from different programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it into webgaleries, encode them in MPEG, you can use contact leaves, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digial; in section add a photos to an album, you will find a description as you can already have on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings for importing pictures to your album bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; use this with the machine, switch the camera to the display mode and switch on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is, a fervent indicator will appear at the bottom end. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file association for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information on each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a single entry or a metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information to be saved internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image does not have been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digial; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is to download and then choose the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug;. when downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select the desired standard selection methods from & kde; as soon as you select photos, use the button to download and then select the selected button. the button exit is long as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available for download. these pictures have been downloaded until now. in this case, the new pictures are highlighted with a star in advance window. if you select this option, of course you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the buttons, a dialog appears where you can select the target album where you can choose from normal folders. details on folder sorting can be found in section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once, by pressing the button loosening. if you want to delete a few, then you have to select this first and delete it later.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera. you should definitely check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to complete the camera, you should make it much faster than the camera.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially balanced names. the filenames can usually lead to double filenames, if you can upload photographs of different shooting galleries in the same album. hence, it can be useful, the date and time when the image has been made, to integrate the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirror-based submissions. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos stored on the plate. the first two affect the data on the author's standard authorization. if you select this, the appropriate entries will be copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different file format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% S. switch on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command-time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option to use camera file names, you have the possibility to change the file names in small book letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; for a photo, is displayed below the name, which the camera is stored in the preview. your settings can be stored and automatically used if you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can also use all information on the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic turn during loading. not all cameras provide this information. in section Page bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is stored in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made information about the date you can use & digiplug; this subtract is based on the picture data. all the pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same size album. not all cameras provide you to read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button Create Advanced and select the option of dates at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload images from their computer is to download the button. select the file selection dialog & kde; displayed in which you can select the files you want to upload. you can also choose more than a file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you, where the pictures will be uploaded to the camera. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means that the data can be displayed in longitude and latitude. the determination of the data can be displayed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical place. not everyone uses a plane to cartoise an area through automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural office and real estate agencies can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a postcard to another & digiplug; if you want to locate a postcard to another & digiplug; users can send a postcard to document the location of the photos, it is good to send the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how the GPS data do into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, artifices and card referral. there are at least three ways to achieve this. right with the correct hardware, about a reworking of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic classification (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera which has a GPS unit integrated. but there are a few that work together with GPS receiver. either as card module or transmission of data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be loaded with psman or gpsbabel. however, you must store these data in the GPX format because it is the only format that is supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate to the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; psCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the previewed coordinates used by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com is no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digial came; try to change as much control over its working course as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digial; you'll need to set up these settings. you can change the settings dialog in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">This option can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image processing. thus, specify the default behavior of & digial; fixed, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the default value and copyright data. these data are automatically selected into the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is selected for downloading from the camera point. also, with a database synchronization these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortationis a synonym for the author's writing tool: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be interpreted as a photographer, freelance photographer or more independent, commercial photographer. since this is also a further explanation for the author of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the picture. this must not be the author if this is entered here for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group or agency should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions absorb the data in the corresponding IPTC rim. this metadata is permanently contained in the picture and not only available in the database of & digial; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image labelling used as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments using the images embedded in pictures. in this way, your labels can also be read by other images. attention: for pictures, which already contain labels, these are overwritten by & digial.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information displayed if the mouse pointer is located in the main window of a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and some video formats. to consolidate you can add the file extensions of this list and added any file in a & digiplug; Albumordner, which is not this extensions, is ignored by & digial; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset you back by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digiplug; can be set on this page to the standard values. however, some pictures have only different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In all the image size ladenquot; if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the picture frame uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color you can select this here. you can use the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">The image and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image processing this type can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images can be coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the exact explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a loss free algorithm. the only effect is that the image data is more time to use and unpack. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file, you can compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on the image quality because the Deflate algorithm is fun.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting-free JPEG 2000 files you can freely save you. even if you were written the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but it was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digial, the image processing was only a picture aspect for photos. currently, it is highly developed to manipulate a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 wreaths with VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance is used immediately. otherwise the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white color is not set. standard, it is a fixed colour balance that was photographed in sunlight on a white map.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the use of the second sensors has the effect that the exposed images will get more details in the top of four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed star, so the parts of your images are burned to catch the top white in the settings. use the adjustment of transparent white in the settings. you can use the adjustment of some unusual results, as they are able to redesign some parts of missing information from the shuttons.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible, as blue pixels generally not saturate as fast as green and red. & dcraw is therefore trying to redesign the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three compromise and can be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance value according to your taste. you must probably set it slightly higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digious; -image processing can be done too. to keep the time for the demo model, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosadel algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the video data, which offers many cameras and which is available with a matrix of color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digial came; and Dcraw make you three alternatives at your disposal: Bilinear, VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. it produces Farbartefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color content of your lenses, you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a colour closing correction since you are carried out during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the colour information and are instructions as they should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digiplug; information about the colour information from a colour space in the other to translate the colours as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if a picture is opened in image processing / colour management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all of your profiles. & digial came; check out the folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles here have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your Profile to deposit. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour scheme view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are managed to manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturers and model you do not fit any profiles. there are some, such as Canon, which contain no color tonmapping or gamblame. currently, dcraw Gamma does not make conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the tonmapping themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft Proof-Profile, which you can emulate how your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied. this could be correct manually, rather than to leave on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious that the color profile for them is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can detect the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image view and display cables; many modules support they have been written to cooperate with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI module, you will see a list of available modules. choose the settings that you want to use, and these modules are then downloaded from & digial; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you can also find some examples in the context menu of the previewed.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin .org or in the books of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the pixels, usually there are 4-5 seconds well. the other tick fields turn off the metadata, or from which at the bottom end of the pictures are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all supported cameras on the left side. on the right side, a button Automatic recognition that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, and you are currently here serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from camera aliste. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / joints, where you insert your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera with your machine to switch to the display mode and switch on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digiplug; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera odell and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for shifting from &gt; images in the trashcan display, you can set the conversation of & digiplug; at the deletion of a photo in a album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down by & digial; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback. otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also add the display of the welcome image of & digiplug; in the starting field you can accelerate the start-up of & digial, under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">When you want to search for new photos and digiplug into new photos. this is extended to search for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digial; if something is deleted from the base folder, asks & digial, you ask if it should delete it out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digiplug; in order to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can choose from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be displayed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digiplug; you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your pictures and to correction and improvement. the image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of My details: editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The editing pane contains a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; in circumstances, they are not part of your distribution. you will find more information about the KIPI modules in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, magnifying factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and underneath the tool bar for fast access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the image processing changes your photos. however, no functions will change the original photo before using File or button stores from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should also make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by creating or use the button "button" restore the image processing in the toolbar. you will lose any change that you have done on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by creating processing reverse or restored, by selecting re-use from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -z to reverse and make Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the & LMB button on the rear wheel or restore button in the toolbar you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions have also been reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between pictures in the same album or the same sample, by using the navigation button in the toolbar. if you have made changes to the current picture, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can put in the photo and zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. normally you will see the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can change this in the setup dialog of & digial; you can call it from the & digial window. see the section for setting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the menu file and get the Standard & kde; printing dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or entire propositions. all images can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album exporting printer driver. if you follow the Assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a side bar at the right edge, the important information and actions for the selected images are available. the same page bar is available without the navigation system, also available in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab, the side bar will appear and disappear once again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can input labels with unlimited size or insert it. note: the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are permitted. the labels will be copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data supports only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC labels in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented on, you can either use the button or change the button to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also download the metadata into the files, but this is always done if you select a metadata settings that is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows an assessment plan of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorption. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the key combination string Ctrl + 0... 5. in order to evaluate more images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation will be written in the IPTC field. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sample view shows a search box to the filtering of keywords, the sample tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digiplug; -meeting made words.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is adapted to the entered keyword. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering a picture series. if you typed various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of a picture will be stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view, select a keyword in the sample tree, this will only be applied to the resulting image and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the sample filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sample sheet is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - datum-, sample and viewpoints. if there is one or more keynote filter from the right side, only the edges of these two are displayed. all key words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw up keywords and place. suppose you have several pictures in the main view. if the sample has already exists, you can simply pull it out from the right side bar and put on the selection. this appears where you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures at a calender date. the sample filter is based on no keywords, which have been selected with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword from the right-wing tree was pulled down and put it. a dialogue asks if this sample is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at each start of the program. it can also be switched on with Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or to be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry will be searched for the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can define a Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have used it mainly on & digiplug; s adjusted for concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you have a colorable workflow, the colors of your camera or scanners have actually seen a predictable or scanned colors. using a color-administered workflow you can compare the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners, and that match the colors that match you or in the web from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic in color management comes, everyone wants to press the buttons it must be provided for the results which he wants to express. unfortunately, color management is to provide you sufficient background information on color management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions to make sure you receive the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">When your workflow flows all six below the criteria specified, you do not need to take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image costs are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB work so well and makes life for all so easy, why should one use another colour space so that you need to make thoughts about colour hazards?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of Limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufean region, and the colours in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colors, please visit Bruce Lindmere page and click on info and then click on information about RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB color space or do not need to install your monitor. if you're working as a color space from sRGB, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections available to improve the image in most cases. therefore, use a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions standardization, equal, automatic and contrast expand from the menu Corrigating Automatic Correction is automatically attempting to make the best of your colours. you will need to experiment with these effects to see what's best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without its color shady. this function is often a magical correction for pictures which are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method adjusted the luminosity factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. this makes the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automated: this method maximizes the color space in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the entire history of history.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast, this method improves the contrast and luminosity of RGB values of a picture by moving the lowest and highest values of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The Weißer equals & digial; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white cut of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are so far from the originality there are areas with overexposed points. if you can perform the white content in the shell mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your ways are better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white salad algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start using the menu entry colors white like the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adapted to the size. on the left hand side are adapted both the original picture as well as the preview of the target picture. if you want to see the original white settings, then it is enough to click on the lower window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target pictures has a red markers. the Luminance of pixels below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right side, a histogram is displayed that once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful because most pixels have very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or their sum will be indicated. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow of Justices can be improved or dimms down the shadow of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">With the controls mentioned above, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and afterwards somewhere on the image preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white button. this way also the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white button with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed index increases the colours when more than a color channel is overexposed. this will be displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Save the buttons as and store exactly this. every setting of the white-button you have set, you can save to a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button does all filter values return to their standard values and the associated neutral white button. note that neutral settings will also be another photo as your original. if you save this, your originality is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the Kodieriefe per color channel for the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. this coding does also need more plate, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG for formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonmapping can be performed by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be set to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound value. this tool is easy to adjust even your settings, so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of exposure to correct the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects gives you four colour effects, a solar power effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon effect and a canopy filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical workmanship was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect that had completed the sensitive photopapier from the additional light. this was the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colours were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to easily adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity is controlled by the solar factor. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase generates a negative image that is not possible to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original is the (1) and the same intensity (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one of the best optimized color film from the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated paints in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers strongly saturated paints but also some photo papers, especially those of the barely landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonlight simulates neonlight on contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the test result and the shooting repetitions the strength of the Neonlight. in large pictures the filter can transmit the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual you want to experiment with the tools in the menu under colors. all your Justices can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, this tool is a good choice to improve the saturation instead. all changes you can do in preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple leukle / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog appears at this tool very complicated, you need only the range of slider. more concrete the three shooting below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a Graph of Intensity values, an histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the Graph there are three shooting values which can be shifted in order to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is the regulator to move and make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated, based on the settings of the picture, the following options are available on the left.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram is dominated by a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic division is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark sounds, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammac.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the inputs of the shade, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for an automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each section. there are also two controls which can be used to evaluate the output files. for example, the compression of the output values can be used for example a somewhat light image as a background while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and store: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and later reloaded. this Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes you will automatically adjust the colour pipette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the evaluation of the HistoProgram for Rot-, Green, blue and the Luminanzees.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposed means controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and allows you to display the combined score of all channels. this is a indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the entrances to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated on your settings. the following options are available on the right side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel provided by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to these webs, there are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. most of the images which have been recorded with a digital camera, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a short ventridge to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones can correspond with dark diabetic patterns and the corresponding image pixel darker will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original pictures is a red marking. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change a point on the curve that is the original value. create a point on this line and move it to and from where the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can make exactly this. each curve you can have created with this file system and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp spa format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sunbathing. select the color pipette which you want to use and click on the originality to set the checkpoints for the Rot-, Green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option for overexposed pixels controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined outcome. this is a indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which was corrected in the Luminance channel. Schattenuette and sun tones was applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the originality is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel Mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the shades of colour.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel Mixer is another developed tool to mix the color shades of the pictures. you can process it from the menu colors channel Mixer from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left section of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison over your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red markers. if you place this in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. this is especially convenient if you are also the option Monochrome, as the channel Mixer then activate DAS tools for the generation of great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green light for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a colour is different from small roughness, which looks different from the colour channel and their sound pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion which allows you to reduce the colour at first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Store as and store buttons will be used precisely for this purpose. any blender position can be used for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp-mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposed means controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and allows you to display the combined score of all channels. this is a indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is under (1) and the working picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your straction ability. with the development of digital photography is black / white a work step, because colour images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford DP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good for portrait pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against heaven. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linsenfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orange.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red linsenfilter. this creates dramatic celtic effects and can simulate lunar light for daily time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the natural shade correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and with it similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the shakes. this is very similar to the process of suppression of a pressure and recovery in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Use the & digiplug; use tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture on your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the engravings of an ancient master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry painting texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied to the photo below. the original picture is shown (1) and the change is changed (2). the relief relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">A decorative frames can be added to the & digiplug; a decorative frames can be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is not easy task. it is possible to keep his attention. this is a psychological barrier for the streuating eye. this is a psychological barrier for the strewn eye. below frame, the module can be launched from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, make the desired frame type for your image. penetrated the image with a thin line and a wide range (ideal for black-white pictures), it finishes it with a nice three-dimensional frame which fits perfectly for one bone and decorate the decorative frames with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a format text in any picture at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. you will need to adjust the character set size. the bigger the image, the larger must be the character set. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed, down to the button "OK". after the picture was saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Use the & digiplug; use tool template for use a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template apply to the image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions about size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add to a reduction in file size of the template. if you want to add your template's file size, simply send an e-mail in english to the & digiplug; mailinglist digiplug-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the template. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for templates was placed, a tree view is reflected in the folder structure of the template. the selection of a folder updates the template automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you can find three buttons on which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this knob resized the picture below. if you want to use the template around the position. if you want to apply the template onto the whole image, check the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button in order to move the image below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adjusted to automatically the premise size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digial came; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates particularly in dark areas, cornies pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Daring mask works on the contrast of the edges to look at a picture. actually it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunest and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this means that sharp edges are linked together to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more retrospeculation than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images, often a camera had been applied in internal scarf. images in the shell-format should always have to be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpening filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by pressing a photo with the pair of sharpening work. you can call the menu entry in accordance with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby know how the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, you can achieve further information about the menu entry. in Refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture is much easier than sharpening. use the tool to soften with the menu entry basket and experiment with settings. the reference window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your pictures. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the image. the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values are often producing good results and should be tried at first. an increase of the radius or viewer amplify the effect. if you make the daring mask to be strong, smokers and the impression of Graten in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius offers a lot of pixels on each side of an edge affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures at the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignorant picture, which is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the absolute difference amount. you can define a minimum difference thereby if areas are used with a soft change between the sounds from the sharpened and therefore the beauty of beauty in faces, heavens and water surface areas avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp mask filter. the original picture is the (1) and the working image (2). unsharp mask was applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool Refocus is focusing on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected Entfalting Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to focus on & quot; refocus as only to try the photo. it is used to use a technique named FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique is usually achieved better results than unsharp mask. you can launch it from the menu by calling colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular boom works much better than the Gauge. the Gauge has a very long tail, which is far from the swelling pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse is also widely influenced by the remote pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse is even very heavily influenced by the remote pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of rotation of this module. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very unsharp, but should pay attention to halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a increase in correlation can help artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in space filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely. if the sound pressure is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very poorly. a usable value is 0.03. a high value becomes even more pollution.</seg>
<seg id="502">Incline's sharpness: this is the radius for Gauge's sharpness. use this parameter if your imaging Gauge is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you should use a value equal to zero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the roughness filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">MatrizenSize: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. if you have great values for the circular edge or the Gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Store as and store buttons will be used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters will be saved for later and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, colour and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but immediately left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you check images and compress images, apply as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp mask produces better results as a sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask to use a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp mask must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of the immune system. practically it is the result of the FIR Viennese filter always at least as good as the daring mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filtering, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour screen has to be corrected. this image has been made with a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods used in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Spette sets the sharpness of the area that was darkened to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte makes a modified color for pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools in order to remove no desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The indoor algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the available pre-ferences are displayed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed explanation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a constant Getting over the image. a value of 0.9 should keep the details so that no scarf is needed. please note that the details of the details should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly into all directions, while a value close to 1 is used only in one direction. if you have a combination of film or CCD larches will produce a high value wave similar pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum Getting factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. set this value as suitable for the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rules: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is difficult when it's difficult to create the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullet effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: is how often the algorithm will pass through. usually this is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Protesters wingspan da [5, 90]: angular dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected, then small angle should generate a long run time. you should therefore choose this value as maximum and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrating range [0,1, 10]: integrative stride width in pixels. you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">Save the buttons as and store exactly this. each setting of image errors correct this can be stored into a text file and can be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors correct is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the correct calculation at any time.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see as picture error with Small Artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was done in Guatemala City with a analog camera. like you see there is a unique black artefacts during the journey caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original picture is visible under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug came; a noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a highly protected algorithm by Peter rear.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides a selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor roughs from the camera or motherboards; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on digital cameras from digital cameras, you can read these in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen image above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain of grain which can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can be found in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for filters. large values increase the period that the filters are required per pixel and can be adjusted by the radius of the radius and the colour in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening level. this value sets the pixel spacing to determine the filter points. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details cannot get more and noise or lubricate.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire space can be removed or smoke-pointed. set it at a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a weak or JPEG artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerances of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are corrupted more strongly to increase. it also contaminate the attenapiece.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping factor. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. if it is increased to occur, crafty and phasenjitter will appear on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for smokers that you have set, can be saved in the filesystem and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how rough production can change your lives. the original one is marked with (1) and the correct tune with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture of crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw a little softly for your purpose. do you use a lot easier than to sharpen with the menu entry basket and experiment with the smoothing. the reference window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digial came; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to immerse Gauge 'Smoking, compression straps, compressive images, compressing in digital, original or later digitised images. the smoothing occurs along the image contours and thus obtain the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturers. the textual error is carried out with another tool, the error correction is carried out. the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannv and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of computed compressors, he creates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Save the buttons as and store exactly this. every setting of photo-restoration can now be stored into a text file and will be reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">In the bottom, you can reduce the photo with a receptive noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 iso has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious combination of film on the faces. the original one is below (1) and that correct under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can reduce the scan artefacts which have been read from the scanner illumination and the photopapier. the original picture is visible under (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows to remove Hotpixel by photos taken with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially high-quality raw quality photos a problem since many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in oppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright pixels; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the knob dark. the tool will realise automatically the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have a old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should find the correct image of the dark image to correct the correct image. note that the Wizard will notice the final image, and automatically reload this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview can help you correct within the image. the window window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all departments.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is measured an average of the neighbouring pixel size. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel can be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block can be moved to compose a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which then is used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are dragged to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug came; a vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignment, i.e. exposed corners, to correct a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, often can't even illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and the edges of the image, showing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses exhibit also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 for aperture filters, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also use the center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise unsharpening effects are created through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and colour or grey scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter in a shell filter that without this filter has been applied. the tool is protected by a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three Regions, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the biggest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly offset the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignment, reduce it around a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukins, contrast and Gamma Settings: the edit of a picture with the vignetting correction is reduced the luminance of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options, as you only need to increase the settings as desired.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer repositioning of the target image, then adjust the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma in zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original picture (1) shows the vignment in the corners and (2) the correct image. an leukstronger and double correction was also performed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digial came; Linscorner distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. color distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or truncated shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect effect, but flap on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the card is corrected to the removed corners to the second Grades. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion may be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Grades. with negative values, tonne-shaped distortion may be corrected and positive values will be hooked distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth Grades. this value acts stronger than the edges in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter specifies the parameter to the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus introduces a correction first degree of gravity. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this is adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows a preview of correct adjustment. the values you use for your image will be stored and used next to the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or turquoise correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. if you make this correction as all first by. if you make a picture new to cut and carry a tonne of tonne correction would be the effect of the folding.</seg>
<seg id="586">In order to help you find the best correction to you. move it to an important place such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection, you can adjust the tons / kissenshaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a kissing shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformation from the image processing or the zoom controls from this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonne-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frames and paintings it is the perspective to correct the angle in the image 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand, you always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonne-shaped correction is applied to a church in Norway. the original one is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpcue.org web page. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters of film particles and film sensitivity (ISO) if you want to simulate the grading texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film particles and the dominance of paint green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter channels make the reproduce of infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filtering on a landscape portrait of New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the modified picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digial came; filter film gradation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce screenings on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X, to increase the sensitivity of films to improve the manufacturers of large silver grains of photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere loosed from daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, road photographic images, especially in your monochrome photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granular grains of the body. the default value is, even higher values need to be used on ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-effects on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the working-based film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digial came; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digial came; filter oil paintings gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulator to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large images. smooth the leaves or from the other side are considered.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original one is marked with (1) and the result is marked with (2). pin size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digial came; filter charcoal drawing uses dy- and intensity gradients to define a sprout shape. therefore, images of the gradient is slow to change. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to outline. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator choose the pin size and the lower limit the contrast (Guttte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digial came; filter engraving your image in 3-D when it was stamped into wax. it is using a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important content. the filter uses the difference between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the working picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion-effects. it uses protected protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: splits the image in cells and look like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using impetus effects. it uses protected protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Influence: ignoring the picture along globular lines that emanating from a center. this simulates the imaging a zooming camera and thus produces a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unusal: ignoring the picture by rotating the pixel by a focal point. this simulates the visual acuity of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Rangeal: verge the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera inlet. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion detection: imaging the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the imaging of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or a train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly impregnation: ignoring the picture softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solids: ignoring the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the imaging of a arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart sharpness: finds the color basin in the picture and get it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore stop this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelf drops are a nice small tool to make shelf drops onto your image. this makes it natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn urge protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Tropical size allows to change the size of the drip. since the drop-size is not necessary with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small pictures. the number changes the number and density of drops. fisaugen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stop using the & digiplug; image processing offers a range free of control drops. use the selective tool to select the area, e.g. a face, which shall remain free. if you start the filter drops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelf drops. the original picture (1) displays a quiet sunset and the working image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can take it by mirror or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu individually rotating or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photograph in a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to reduce it is simple. the great question is how you can find a picture imbble and the details sharp? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information here or guess? the CImg algorithm here is used here, making it a good job. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. select a change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture of a better quality, then try the tool for bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digial came; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Lower aspect ratio maintained: if this setting is enabled, when the new size is maintained, the aspect ratio of the original picture is retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rules: [0, 100]: this parameter is concerned larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullet effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Save the buttons as and store are used precisely for use. each input can be used as a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shooting is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of picture bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a commonly-guided operation, but also a frequently underestimate tool with the mouse, simply create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut out. this allows you to change a good overview as your photo after cutting. you can drag the size of the rectangle, creating a new rectangle with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button The cutting-button in the toolbar and the picture is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file saved file or file save in the menu file to save the newly added picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the prestige range, you can change the size of rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In tool After side-aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in the high format the larger amount of height and in the cross-format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After cutting aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to select the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the max. ratio button to cutting the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After cutting aspect ratio saves the settings regarding aspect ratios (Horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool, these settings are stored as standard values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data can be reflected in the original image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the help support permit help to blend up your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are an option to cut a rectangle in a similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division which is on different natural growth pattern such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the petals of a sunflower. it dives into all sorts of things that we are considered to be nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the old Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you set up your pictures, buildings and even photos to make your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1: 1,618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule will be interpreted as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid aid lines if you set up a picture. these help will be recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirits will get good results for your photos. compared to third party gel, the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangle is used to direct the golden spiral. that can be one line or different objects. this can be easily accessible without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also leading up from the above mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, gold triangles are not equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break your frame, create an effect of professional photographers and dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information into the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the relief lines can be invisible. on this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are rotated by an angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; please select transformer and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button preferences you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module allows you to position a horizontal and vertical line. after moving it to position the mouse pointer in view of the picture, you can attach it to a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned out a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair it is the function transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option glands a bit after turn. notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All pertinent transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty zones that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle Right: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees to the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">According to the customization of the perspective, the picture will be a little contaminated. for a single configuration, this effect is small but two adaptations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective, you will get unbeaten triangular holes in the corners. the possibility of this is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press it horizontal and vertically at the same time. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right side of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line ends. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the image, the picture will be a bit wisely. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two chings create twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After switching the image, the image has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. an option to eliminate them is the image with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digial came; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the species such as these libraries were compilated. in most distributions you can edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo, used to localize the monitor and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">In order to correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as XML file in GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate to the main window and call the menu. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course this file contains the same time as the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, automatic correlation is performed in red shows. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera-time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. click here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera-eit. the deviation below is the deviation below. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have a trace from a place for images you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and the difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these limits here and then correlate to the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialogue. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same location. since the dialog box will use the button OK to use the button OK to set the data at the current picture.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found in accordance with the displayed area and enlarge it. select the relevant region and enlarge it again, until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the height can always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite photo and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG downstream module is a tool to change pictures without blocking your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store pictures listed below, images in the JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss free storage is that the file size is increasing because there is no compression of the colour information. this is also noticeable in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI teams under kde-imaging @ kde.b.g. attention: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodizer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG codizer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module allows you to insert a basic transfer. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for your DVD player. with this module, it is possible to use the formats DVD / 16th CD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first choose the images to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then recorded in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, 16th CD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is pre-set and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the picture transition is specified below. a lower value produces very sudden, a high contrast to a very smooth picture.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set as next. in doubt you should set it black. the name and path of the generated file can be set under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep it as close as the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can convert the generation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can go fast or enjoy a coffee, and enjoy the Diashau when you return back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages over the button settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper in standard photometers. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the imprint Gimp. this is, for example, to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original size of him is: expect from dcraw not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get a dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First you can convert the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw picture Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for white, brightness and red / blue amps. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch doesn't work effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains unchanged and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-held algorithms and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses the loss free LZW Compressed.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you need to edit your images often or later, you should not use the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file, stored in the JPEG file in the Exif file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack mode mode allows you to convert various images to once. do you use this mode so if you are sure, for example by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, here you have the possibility to write existing file automatically. this is helpful if these were created in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can put the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the template.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can add the image, or enlarge it. in addition, four types of image changes are made available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to adjust your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can set the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your preferred E-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the imagined images in advance. more pictures may move on the list of pictures below.</seg>
<seg id="873">After completing the module, the images window with the images displayed by you will be displayed. using the button images you can add another pictures with a file selection dialog. for the last selected picture a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>

<seg id="917">& brochure album; offers you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & brochure album; integrated and the other as a module (see). in the following part of the user book, the version is described in & photophotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create about the menu file HTML....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, every area is more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First you enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next you select whether a & photoCD album; -export file is to be created on the review page. nutritional information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. in this way, you can avoid that information can be displayed without a description. note that all pictures are exported from a party. please note that this setting is therefore not used to hide certain pictures in particular.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML page should look like. most settings options are clear, which is why not been made specifically for this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. in this way you have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no images for example have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore change your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission rate, as well. if it wants to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different file and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent proposition a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the main folder where all your images will be stored. this folder will be stored and set automatically at the next time. this enables you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if this is a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL that you define here should be the folder. otherwise, the web browser needs to start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder you need to manually copy them manually. in order to specify import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only described subordinate settings have all three based on basic folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will set, whose name you define in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking for a family party, a meeting or anywhere else, with other users of & photo album; you may, of course you want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures. if you have already turned out a HTML page on the pictures, recording site, etc., you'll have to do with & cool album; this work will not even make it once more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & CD album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kin file. you can import other files into your database. the properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. they distinguish themselves whether the pictures itself are stored in the file or whether you can find all images into the file, so that you can keep all images into the file, but the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the menu File... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images that are found in the folder of .kin file. if the respective images are not found, the images of the URL that you have in the folder of HTML files are searched for. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will be described by the dialog for exporting images which you can export about the menu File....</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether to act internal or external .kin files. there are also the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you can copy the manually into the .kin file, you will have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kin file copy and copy photoelectric album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kin files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG files and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not to compress the files if you want to compress this, simply select the Export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is a maximum picture size limit. if you want to send your friends images, as the .kin file would not be very large. here you can limit the size, by example, that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file containing the extension .kim out of the web browser or from the menu file importer... select & kphotoCD; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importer consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folders will to import pictures.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you want to personalise the category of people of the imported file (if you are a Dans), while this category is asked to imported the categories of the file to be imported, and what categories they are to be imported in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images to browse and watch: if you see pictures, you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday groups and discover a picture of your friend with your friend, perhaps you would like to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps of (1) fixed information about your images, about (2) search and look at (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today your videos also cares. at many places in this manual, more pictures are spoken, but often it also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& cool album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your pictures. this is a simple XML file that allows you to backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy on a floppy or revision in CVS where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& brochure album; now remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this with future launch. if you want to start a different folder with images, you can start your photo album; with the -c option. as example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu entry settings of photoelectric album; set up in a window, with which you can change the settings of & photophotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will discuss the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can open a preview setting and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can define various properties, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories, subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up full scale groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediate club as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list, you can select the selection options available to you. in the list box list, select the category you want to configure. in the left window half there is a list of the current category and in the right one list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& cool album; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. nutritional information is available on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can be described and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it can be tested that the modules have been tested with & photophotoalbum; demo database can be downloaded either via the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu assistance. do not say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, thus making it possible that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you splits functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The greatest difference between & photophotoalbum; and other applications also using KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so that you can use the features with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & photophotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all pictures you are showing the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & brochure album, the modules also have been handed over a list of albums. here you can download and cool album as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photophotoalbum; s browsers in the category of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the user dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you're using the category persons, your photo album will be selected, so if you would have selected individuals to view and to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the area modules that modules can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a starting screen when you start your photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can see your image database. in the section we will not display any information about your pictures. in this section we will show pictures that shows you an overview with all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & photophotoalbum; is the possibility to view any picture with comments. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the image has been added individually or for a larger number of images certain comments simultaneously. if, for example, on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsers, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these comments when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In the list of three lists with a text field, by choosing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can use them again when you enter information on your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the move to the pictures within the list: if you are a family party and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can make sure that the used names are postponed upwards, those persons can be found faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting to date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each picture individually, you might want to edit these images and add these pictures with comments. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to select all of these images and add the menu item multiple entries to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. in order to show that it is a transition group, a special symbol will appear.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the note, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or subcategory. in addition, you can also add an entry to a category and to make this entry in a subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires that you are illiterate just your categories alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note-catalogue, by clicking the vest, which form the top edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by drawing it out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, click on the button options... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>

<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will receive an overview with previews of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter here. you can see the size of the preferences, by simply pointing down the mouse with the intermediate button of mouse, configure.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you make an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this image will be displayed. if you have no window with a picture of view, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from you want to delete either the remove button or choose the menu option. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& cool album; offers you a solution for this problem. of course you can also use your photo album. of course you'll need to record the pictures anywhere. in the picture you can see the view of & photophotoalbum; if not all needed pictures from the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>

<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them unlimited. you can also save several window arrangements and simply change between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To start a window via or under a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views to each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cardboard box above.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have a scene created, you can render them. & Povray; 3.1g to Renders, this program has to be installed correctly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the symbol Renders in the toolbar or choose the menu entry to the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render-mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert multiple Render modes, from a quick preview of to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon's icon in the toolbar or in the menu view, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render-mode has a name. you can enter every name, but it is a name that can recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only one small section of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used by a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflexions lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture emerges with only a beam of pixels, different errors can be created. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stucco effects in curves and lines, also sometimes details will not appear if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses an anti-aliasing technique to reduce the influence of this error. generally, pictures of this property can be seen better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects the Povray; more than a beam of pixels. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. the second method is adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because every pixel is continuously being divided and adaptive because every pixel depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels, then both pixels are computed through the tracking of a certain number of pixels using super sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixel size. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted individually.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option reduces aliasing effect is the generation of roughness for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, change & Povray; the rays of a tiny amount to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can set whether the alpha channels should be computed by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding beams have not met an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray is unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; first scene, select the menu entry file impedance... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; yet not the full command of & Povray;. if any error messages or warnings occur, a dialog box shows a list of messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source between the two special comments / / * PMRawrenin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source text into the text file in the text editor. to import objects into the scene, select the source text editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can use source code for & Povray; also inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler. usually this povray or x-povray is usually called.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in your own business view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version supports 3.1g and 3.5 versions.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data) into the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene, you'll also need to enter the path into different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>

<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the windows type plate.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the points of the points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values are a more precise wire model and thus provides a better twist for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the details stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross-less detail for advanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided when the camera uses an extended projection screen. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess tables pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess tables pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you are able to activate cantilation, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for renders of scenes. the values for depth and threshold values can be adjusted. in detail, the parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in section window orders will be explained how you can create window arrangements and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Combination field standard window arrangement: displays all available window regulations. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list required window arrangements shows all available window arrangements. you can create a new arrangement with the button adding and delete a selected arrangement with button inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and may not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can create and delete the views with button Add.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with a card box, you get a card box together with the previous view and suspended the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start out without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create simple scene, very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully notice the following warnings, before you keep it difficult to use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program to first time you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have anything faultless installed, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement is:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene you generate. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains now a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the content of view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentary about & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything on the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that you can change the camera in view of the camera, with which you can change the destination point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button to a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button users or input button, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could adjust for example a Quader (Insert endogenous body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a sensitive method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; it actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and press the button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view shows the plain now even if the moment is only as limited level. if you renown the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you watch the object Tree below, you will find that you can find the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scale, turn and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizon, only that you get to know some of these parameters. choose the shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose the moment some times.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can select how the object is supposed to be inserted. you can change the name in the object tree (name = bottom pigment), with one click on the button preview, how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only shows a matte black material because you can still need settings for the pigment. do you think that you can check the look at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest thing.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader & ball in the preview, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now set correctly. if your image is now available with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the color list. here you have to enter two new attributes. in the color list, select two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this record twice, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object olive tree, select the colors in the object size and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should be able to carry out this step, as you should have understood the fundamental work of & kpovmodeler; you should have already understood the ball as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button application), so that the sphere in contact with the bottom. otherwise, the ball would float over the ground as you have moved the ground around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. set the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to your own. as already in the bottom, enter the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Just select Subobject and change the name for example in bulment pigment. click on the Pigments, then select single-colour and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can get more decent effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen images, and click on application or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine effect and reflection are already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which possibilities & kpovmodeler now offers you. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render-method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you rave a scene raytracen, the rendering of the hypocrites from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera which is reflected by the objects) is reflected in the scene, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will work as fog. thus, the scene pixel will be processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will be able to see the scene without a camera. without a light source you can see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously done with & kpovmodeler before.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you can open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you'll need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Presents the scene in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage have been rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you don't have the stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeats the last reversed command. this menu entry can only be chosen if you have used the reverse reverse.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler., here you can change the look, the keyboard and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keycode. you can modify or add new commands to this option to change the default indicator for & kpovi; commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog for setting up the toolbars. you can add and remove the toolbar for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a possibility to compensate for rough surfaces without changing any diffrale on the surface, without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a Bump-Map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then processed further to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by applying a picture file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a more comfortable image of view and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the & LMBn; or button Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply type the first signs of the filename in the browser window. if a matching file name was found, the file is highlighted by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog for Rent - & kuickshow; there are five card cards. in three, General and machining and slide show, you can adjust the mode of work of & kuickshow; in the two other, short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser, the keyboard cuts can be set for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can keep further below. the default is no full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is enabled, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still watch the current picture. this reduces the delay if you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">This option stores & kuickshow; when opening the name of the last opened folder. next to opens & kuickshow; this folder opens in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beams to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can show & kuickshow; so that only some of the data types are displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window will be extended to the full screen. this option is switched on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly used in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, players, playlist, playlist, playlist, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok still has some own command options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing relationship. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user doesn't run, why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin Require 'Corundum's LoadError error =' Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is to-this script. '' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the Scripts / Templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend the required functions. you will quickly notice that the writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange with amarok and control Amarok. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; which should pull every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts themselves permit the evaluation of external programs and commands. for this purpose, dcop &gt; is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; relatively easy can be called. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; send alerts to all the scripts. for this reason, scripts are to monitor their standard entry continuously and react to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the setup dialog. to store the storing and loading of the setup data each script needs to take care of. if a script is started, Amarok uses the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script could now ask & b; with derivatives further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata, or the pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change newvolume indicates a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize menuclicked: submenitemTitle has been handed over to the selected entry into the playlist, so you can use the script function dcop amarok Script anchor MenuItem (submenitemTitle). to use one entry, you can use dcop amarok Script to the eCustomItem (submenu Title).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; completed, or if the user fails to stop a script, sends the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, to work space. e.g., storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarah script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server using bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be downloaded with bzip2 (.bz2), so the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages to accept content packages. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x) to the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and hang the link to the wiki scripts side of & amarok; apply for your entry to kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you must have installed it (including the included programs, because & amarok; requires some of it to find such modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD preceded that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, for example, it will work, but Fluxbox will work for example problems, but we are trying to use amaroK to all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably you will see one of your files a mistake in the day Lib library. you can make this error to the Taglib developers among bugs.kde.org and hang it to the capsulated file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is that Taglib crashes the Meta-Info out of this file. please report to this error to the Taglib developers among bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as database, try time SQLite. support for this in & namarok; is slightly mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of you have been compiled with the same compiler version. if B & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib, but with GCC 3.3.x was compiled, then this leads to crash when working the meta-information.</seg>

<seg id="1250">You can also send us a backup by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and send us a good backstage, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is that many program files can write data as UTF-8 into the meta file, but these are not as Unicode labelling. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you are using the command line dcop. to make use of the command line dcop, you must make sure that & K3b has started; then enter something like this on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kines; -program common, supports & K3b; mainly two more parts listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface of & K3b; features such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createchnical Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref ate eDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DCOPRef currenteDataDVDProject () DancopyDvd (), Angle Cdrd () of the Burndvd image (KURL url) of the Burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one can obtain a project via the command line: DCOPRef (K3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can get a reference to the project by # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">This createFolder (QString name) is createFolder (QString name, QString). addUrs (Qstring name, QString). (QString path) of the other (Qstring path) of a rename Item (Qstring path, QString newname). (Qstring path, QString newname).</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash Project = $(dcop K3b K3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $Project createFolder Mito dcop $Project createFolder / foo dcop $Project addateFolder / fofile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& Caudiodes; is an audio CD; -reading for & kde; can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& Caudiodes; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compress & CD data on the hard disk) and from many codiers, which can be encoded as standard as MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (loss free compression). further codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and compressed into WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read the & CD, it is used by & kaudiodo; cdparanoia is used. nearly every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed yet, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers are installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary to compile itself. however, only the codiers are installed, which is needed. if the FLAC is not used, the installation is also not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welter Codiers provides a small introduction of codiers, audio quality and compressive factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; as already said, uses & kaudioanoia to read out audio data from the & CD. if not the firmware of the & CD is not possible. in any case, it is not possible to handle the mechanisms of the copy protection. avoid the mechanisms of copy protected audio CD.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once must be made (the setup dialog may be called so often called up to a suitable configuration), it will be explained after the daily use of a & CD. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumbled at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD. get any information from the freedb from the Internet or can be fully operational without any network, whereby everything will be included manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example there are more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB enquiry of the CD data is set up in accordance with the establishment of a CDDB registration card. (this may be locally or online, in the latter case, first the connection to the internet must be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts the read and - when an encoder has been configured in the settings tab in the setup page - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read from another encoder as standard. it is noted that in advance the encoder has been configured in the settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager, so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, pipeas) for program events (like reading the & CD; finishes).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog dialog of & Caudiodes; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codiers and compression rates and helps you to choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats using data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG likes today a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions free, but it is open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates) but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resultant compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a Title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-H '= 128 kbps CBR 01 stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music from young people, portable devices and car steresystems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without view of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which can be manually entered or through the program automatically via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be transferred / used with & kaudiodes; and the code name to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codiprograms, there is often a combination of program settings for the coding and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (english: day) add if MP3s must be coded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudioscreator must be added; the result looks like this:... -tt {title}.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & chewing diodes; parameters that can be used (= button drawing in the Assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which persons can read / input the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from the computer itself. it is noted that here only from text is said: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not an attorney. however, no one can prevent that from the & CD; more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added. all information can't be added to the artist by a & CD; business, physically or virtuell can be received.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiodes; is actively select a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used for retrieve the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiodes are set up; to use freedb, the geographical zone should be used on the next lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and equates the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of reflections for online check-out of & CD; information during the read of a & CD; alternatively, the full database can be downloaded or (usually created per month) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which alignment program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used; anyone who wants to know exactly the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD. it's always aware that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must first be installed, if this has not been done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the read WAV files, the coding and thus the desired file format may be chosen. during the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codiers package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coding can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. further information on codiers are in the chapter of Welding Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codiers, more information can be obtained through the input of a command like lame-help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device designation of the & CD; / DVD drives, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to specify both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD. do not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give the tips as you need to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, but they are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step example, and you will get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, and read all our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' using MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packets for your Linux distribution as it is not quite free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source file what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have screams on it (eg; by copying or copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section treats the basic setting of & kaudiodes;, something that is thought to be done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for every wither & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the used coding for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). where we are lazy to use the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with any of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device model is delivered to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to install the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The cartel card General settings. here gibts do not too much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be changed and typed as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just ask for incomplete information, so you are informed if information is missing for creating keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the read of the & CD; to connect to the Internet, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, will start immediately to read the & CD. this is easily connected to the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or day entries, can be changed easily. the directory or file name will change easily and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, you will need to use the select fields and freedb. however, this is more than 620 MB in order to use this. in order to use freedb in the open mode, the two select fields have to be selected, at least the first card box is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is available for us. these are settings for the data request, for the call of the & CD; information from freedb server on the internet. how to know the system that data will get the CD? read the section about freedb. set the section about freedb. set it all as shown in the screen image.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't want to download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the page freedb.org and look at a mirror server in your proximity. on this way, the load between the computers will be distributed. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server as well as many firewall protocol 8880 standard regularly booting, there may be more fortunate with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit a CD; data on the freedb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously cut pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? paralleles reading and coding? the author knows it not, therefore try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you want to cross this, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files are stored. if you do not have any space on another drive, the files will not be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">To enter everything as it is on screen photo. the command is a bit long, under circumstances a little bit must be turned to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of production of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be erased in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: using a dual-core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiodes; this configuration will be used as a standard for each output of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizing structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described, as the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. first, we will create a connection to the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for each spin-up & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD which is not included in freedb, screen photos show a little differently from the data for a & CD. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually can be submitted manually, instead of sending them from the Internet. comments are pointing to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this sample is to be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done yet, now the & CD must now be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, such as in screen photo. this only if the & CD was identified as audio CD, and can be identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then search the questions and answers after the help or go back to previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been collected from the freedb, all tracks of the pieces are already completed and moreover, the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; you will select a window, and you can select the database entry, which is best suited to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; manually select this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Type the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen image, select the title of the player in the first line of the 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not need to be entered in the input field 'Current title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of inidicell per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words begin with grandchildren or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags; this option is set up to the tab control settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the help of codiers to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that is obviously wrong with the style of the imaging CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; -data is not available anyway. for more information, go to the Internet site of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. Pop or Rap for example are to find below rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', you come back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editors appears and you can see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece. just enter the titles of each case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and adjust the same way up to all the title data of the & CD; typed.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each row of a piece. just the titles are selected or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or set the button all pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection read the read process, this window appears to confirm the confirmation. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track that which expires.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for turning on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program will be shown in the left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can you see if you are trying to work with a code which you have not yet installed. pieces which have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked if you have read writing to the folder for temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3. to read and coding in parallel. note the status notice at the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of programming has no configuration settings to suppress this behaviour. the only thing that can be configured is the result unclear. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous expressions and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded, and a third order is coded for the queue of the code. after the last piece is coded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiodes; you need & kde; 3.x / 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and use the button you play in the tool bar, select the entry to play from the menu or set the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the & kmid; -window. (with several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played one after another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece takes place, you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song goes too quickly or too slow, click on the arrows to the left and to the right of tempo. to get back the original speed, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">Space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on space bar is like a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry break in the menu, thus interrupts the space button while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces use textual event, other use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set the events that will be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined that you need to manually adjust it. if you are reading in the menu settings, you will automatically select the karaoke text. you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the menu settings or song events on the menu settings. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played in series according to this section, as you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. here you can find the collection of collection under the point.... Click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can select the requested information in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application, this collection is not stored. remember that if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In order to add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collector manager. there, you can add a song to the button. again, the file dialog appears where you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of Automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using File Open or drag & drop) will automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you'll need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click here.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu sequence of the menu, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be reestablished.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song or jump, select the previous piece, select the previous piece from the menu or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be deleted. however, this does not matter if it is not stored in the abandoning of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translates into events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type change patch to Trumpet and thus always a trumpet sound, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM radio and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you must process the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite file).</seg>
<seg id="1656">An MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required conversion for playing a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except for the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. however, this is that every occurrence is a different textID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "name of Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be compatible for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is given as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that GM Patches are given in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that use this instrument to create sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun powder. in addition, you will also apply the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">Now, if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (tissue signal), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Trodrum Patch of the patch is meant to represent a different percus instrument (Drums, tank, Maracas & etc;), and not the one that means the sound height of the always same drum means (how some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument you need to use only in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are used primarily to form tones to the percussion channel. look at the keyway as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, you simply do it just in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices require 16 channels, CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, set up following the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is used on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will naturally be defined in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Percussion Patch on the Pergolfer channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio is multiplied to which the ratio of Pitch Bender events is multiplied with the value n, this will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to make no decimal number in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM is to play a keyboard, which is to play a pitch event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards will try to play two sounds up to a octave up. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you'll have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog for MIDI settings. you can find it in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The Channel view is a window with a whole number of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these occasions you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a certain channel. for each channel you can select a tool where you have changed a tool, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the sounds of the sounds. view the menu settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed to play with which a song is played. the higher the number, the larger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you find such a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">An MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; in order to result the same MIDI file on two different devices, as well as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can not force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while using a mp3-file (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file, you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc; they have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid. this happens because & kmid. without AWE support it was compiled. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source code (for example from kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the setting of Automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow button on the left of Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. in order to restore the speed, you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & standstill; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this mode I need to play an MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, only enter the & Konqueror; -windows change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file just once, without having to add them to a collection, turn the setting of Automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. access just want to play the first file. so set the setting of Automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animate me that, further to & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid, was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I study Mathematics at the University of Maintenance; Laga. at the moment, I'm going to take a lot of time for my Hobbies, but I try to catch a bit of time. when Hobbies, I try to collect MIDI files, music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an e-mail: larpink @ kde.org or antsr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file by a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, you should get in contact with me, as I might have the file perhaps already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid, fully written in my free time and I don't want to make money to get money. I'd like to emphasize that I only get more programer because / if I get back messages from users (postcards or email).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or a AWE map.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it will then run as if you had a sound card, except you can't listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear if information are displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to pick up the preferred connections under the menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy. if you balance an entry, its group and all subgroups to the current category will be copied and the playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and continuous playlist can also be changed by direct edit of the XML configuration files. of course, you can select the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer, but also through the application itself. simply select the next processing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content will be displayed this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must choose the same with playlist, and select either the processing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode leave or a different group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayful c and Change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 '. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate any other animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / clarity / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during the start does not need to be short, it will automatically end through the opening of another source. however, this would be annoying at the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">An easy example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; runs; & lt; IMG dur = "s; & lt; / mole; In the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring MP3s in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer. here, the path can be set from the MP3s and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here, the output of mplayer can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no riders for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer. everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywic as the set of the backend per mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be added to the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages have to play the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash flash in the dialog dialog box of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The conqueror or & kmplayer; is in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend edition is set within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, phonon all ogg files should be used:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play by TV cards, either using MP3s or XVideo (this requires uxvplayer). before TV you need to set up the used device and the TV channels. this can be edited manually from the configuration dialog, or edit the configuration file manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configuring the VDR (Video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog box in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port must be detected, of which one is selected. the need to be used (e.g. is PAL for West Europe), the correct name has probably included a DVB.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can work only XVideo (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux the only running). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the video forlinux has to be functional for the X server. this is why the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, they are used by KMP3s for the sources different names. at the time of this documentation, this dvdsource, dvd, vvdsource, vcdsource, vcdsource and vadsource. if they are enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1773">When using quote the selection list is displayed with literary entries. for example, if the file is necessary for a project. for example, the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; -files are also written in & in; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã e is used for defining the writing of the font. it is possible to specify the fonts of the font. it can be set to the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection objects are available for creating a new document by selecting the document art and festival legend of settings. 2. the document can be written down by reason of the reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the instruction\\\ 'class contains the settings for the command. read [12pt] specifies the font color. if the font is set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source file has been entered, the & latex file must be compiled. the simplest way for this is the use of the state or the push of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved prior to compile. & spare parts; for storage, the storage is automatically generated.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document failed, the logging should be searched according to the errors. if using quick-construction and eyepiece, this should not be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English) is a text which is treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font color is created. the command\\ Begin {Environment},\\\ and\\ end {Environment}, is to obtain the order of the font within the environment - to which the Riesigâ (English) is the same.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be adjusted within the environment (from\\ Begin {Environment} to\\ end {Environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the conditions within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to illuminate the authenticity and ease of authentication of the document. for example, there are certain types of reading, fat pressure, courses, etc. these commands are either signed with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {emph}: this command is for intensive printing and is long as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word can be displayed in a set with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Ratio: created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ Begin {odds} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background given to the background of the source text with the & latex site, a step-by-step guide is followed by a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & cool;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the Assistant was entered into a little text, a few adjustments should be served for the better reading of the document. these should be a quote, some places in fat and cursive printing and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, a editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor. for an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or printed in a & postscript; / PDF file is converted. easy to try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a different file format (e.g. D e V ice I n1). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for reading of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi issue such as printer, & postscript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are described as for the creation of the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed using file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar is the transformation of the DVI; -file in other formats. once the DVI-file is created from the & latex; source code is created, the conversion can begin converted into different formats using the tool bar in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The advance search for the direct jump from the editor to be added within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& spare parts; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Bind files. for this purpose, only modern settings must be set up in the settings... tools are balanced.</seg>
<seg id="1794">For example, the mouse pointer must be positioned in one line of the source text and have to be clicked on advance search-search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI-viewer is then soaked.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, with one click of the intermediate button of mouse in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document by & kile; used in & eyepiece; set in & eyepiece; used as text editor (settings of eyepiece... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using the quick structure of the & DVI-panel viewer, an error can be given. if a mistake is given, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file descriped the error source in the source code. in the editor you can view the buttons before the error code. in order to consider the error code, the logging file must be clicked on the error code, the error message must be clicked on the logging line, navigating immediately to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the respective button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears to be selected for the written template for the document. the default displays are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document may either be rewritten or used by the assistant to the fast preparation of a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Optional users of & latex; usually used the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & cool; created, stored and charged to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; -file can be created or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template by an existing document and create a selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings... settings are General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which character strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering the document class. typically, they are used as follows:\\ 's class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {5}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and that therefore banned entries to the commands in editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps will be completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can be balanced instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex files; a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps described under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kate; used & Kate; used as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for r & Kate; can be made directly out of & made in the menue.</seg>
<seg id="1809">In order to learn more about & Kate; and his testimonies should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can be used directly with reading of the chapter with the editor of & Kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& cool; offers a very practical & latex; -lacked reference, which can be called upon the following commands of the LaTeX reference. it contains almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Button1 double-click on the button to compensate the & tex; meaning that in this way to click\\ par of\\ par\\ gerskip only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with a left-left mouse button, the balanced text will automatically be copied to the intermediate position.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, you can relax parts of the source code in the editors window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& cool; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source texts and emphasize this. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another colour.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants are gathered together in the text. it is a kind of bookmarks within the text. the mentioning are jumps on the jump or last jump mark. this jump mark will also be highlighted in the first input of a sign automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile; although excellent mospheres are designed, so many environments for writing by a & latex; source code are always ready for selection and groups, and therefore underline your selection. among others the following commands are contained to the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">A complete subsection (group of lines containing on both sides have a blank line). this extended meaning has been added to tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only preventive thing in & cool; is that the only thing is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Has the word below the current cursor position. this selection has also extended meaning because this command is also & latex; commands with an extended star (\\) and a large star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For the part of a part of the document, natch can be removed first of this first. & Kate; offers the keychain Ctrl; K with the whole line is removed. and with its own commands you can download it for a faster result. the following commands are included in the text of the text.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes an entire paragraph. definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description to edit extracts form.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clear that environments can play a central role in & latex; this is why it offers & hile; for nf further orders inferior to work environment for a very good work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, at the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is), the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is), the cursor is placed directly behind the command to reach the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is placed before or within the command\\ Begin {Surface}, the end of the environment is speckled (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of rough environmental commands, you can quickly lost sight. this command will be close to the most recently opened environment, so that the surrounding environment is not broken down.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& cool; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by brackets {...}. under Beverage TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is injected at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the feeditary Klammer.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command is injected at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is), the cursor is placed directly behind the closed clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of welded groups, groups of staples can be lost quickly. this command shut down the last open group so that the swallow structure of the & tex; groups do not break down.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple signs for the purpose is used in & latex; the sign is used for two simple instructions for the purpose. and for this case, the sign is used. & kile; knows this case and for two tightening marks for latex and latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry for the double assumptions can set up in a set of settings... LaTeX - and follow-off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in specific settings (e.g., nv or French) and thus German or French services. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When working on Shift; input button for a smart line breaks. if the current position is located within a list area (such as enumerate or itemize), is designed, not only a line breaks but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">The current line with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & cool; is intelligent enough to underline preset & latex; - or custom environments to underline settings; set up... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users found the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all Et signs (amp;) each other; seek & cile; after the simplest table in the darkened line. although this tabulator is not allowed to add and cile; some intermediate space for the columns is added to the current tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code case has been extended; in order to build special commands (mostly for r & latex;) it has been built for nf different modes. all these modes can be set for different working modes. all of these modes can be set up for different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment with the command\\ Begin {Surface} is plugged; automatically add the command\\ end {Surface} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the button bar is removed, the last letter of the input will be removed and can be changed. on the other hand, the list can also be diminished by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All orders are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, you will have to be installed in selecting a command. alternatively a jump to these positions is possible, and you will have a jump to these locations by allowing you to be frozen to these positions.</seg>
<seg id="1842">With Settings; set up and set the settings of these lists. it can be used to treat different exercises for free & tex; - and & latex; -instructions as well as possible decoration of the general language-used adult.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is to be entered for the fulfillment of environments. it is always used to have a large list with\\ Begin and the call of the complete mode is used. on the other hand, environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for implementing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When entering the full-period mode, the command is automatically installed and the key is automatically installed and it appears\\ Begin. after that, the surrounding process can be continued to the simplest way and then can be stopped by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. as soon as & kile; recognizes that it is a common room environment, it is even a first\\ item command to be installed.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this activated, then test & quantitative information; if the specified information is correct. select the use of the application even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">In version 3.3, the error search was completely redeveloped. Diesupports for the DBG Debugger has been set, as well as the support for DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which enables various implementations.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantitative; insertion.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching debugger plugin in the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger-Plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative description; -user interface:</seg>

<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. it appears usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debuggers everything is available, or a part of the following functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is required for debugger, if necessary, or it forks the plug-in with, at debit card. this action is activated by default, which is used by a debugger that must not be respected in normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Starte the session. closes the connection to debugger or finishes the ludge according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP requirement to server a debug requirement. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the list of debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start with the execution of the scripts and the currently running line continuously. if this happens while the script is continued, the execution occurs when a debit system was started, the script starts with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Tells the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information about to overwatch variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is given, the execution happens once a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in script, without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in script, but if possible, it is fixed in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Follow the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there wouldn't be the current.</seg>

<seg id="1996">This document describes how tagging XML files are to create, then the formattionrc; and also toolbar. shortly, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the Featureseller, the & quantitative file; this file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. tool bar allow quick insertion of tags in a document without a risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are not as folder. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the day XML files. tag folder bear the name of the describe-language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML to and declare whether they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all possibilities and limits are explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a day XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains no one element above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it & lt; attr &gt; a argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. gives the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attributes and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a kerf and a name name. the arguments that can be handed to the method. can be empty or% daily name%, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container-day placed the elements of a list together. it can only occur for a attribute description. it is only element element element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags inside a dialog. this day can only occur for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Is the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be available for every field in the dialog (e.g. a for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Day). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neat and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not work, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files the tools dialog at the top of & quantitlus; -windows to start and review TagXMLA. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is not yet available for loading of the TagXML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the file name for this day XML file should be schemes.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this day XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; -file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed via DTD Beam DTD; this means that diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = use 1 for & quantitative information; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can set up action with Settings... created. click on New Action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action has been assigned to this action. by clicking the User button, a keyboards can be assigned; with Kone the current keyboard cuts are awkable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can change external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that you can modify or enter the document (or parts of the document); even the quick release dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be indicated. for example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptile variable in the command line, such as sh% script.sha / scripts in the script: $KDEHOME / share / apps / scripts / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable, which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; process. if from & quantitlus; only one instance is running, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantitative information; from the external script it is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the name name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script input of & quantitlus can take advantage of the standard input. in the selection box input can be determined, which is to send to the default value. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input can also be redirected the output. there are two types of issue: normal edition, on the standard issue; error messages, which should be done on the standard output text, which is to be adjusted to the standard output text by which the value is set in the box issue:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the awup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the present case it is not too many, so one can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool is added, you must add actions and configure action. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the same day to the matching tool.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, activate Dialogue "Day" if available, so that a input when using this promotion is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better, we will use & kiconia; choose from the & kmenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconia; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as unparalleled, further interpreted), or should at least notice a message to the user that clicking this symbol will be a & lt; startup; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol there must be associated with the action. this happens via the menu with Settings... (in & quantitative aplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags so that's what you are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantitative data; functions for toolbar add or it should set these for better overview by some trench into several groups. do you open the toolbars dialog for Settings toolbar. make sure the desired tool is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (very left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element it should be added to the toolbar to the right, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to use a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator does not support groups. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & Konqueror; button on the opposite of the button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back to the right folder. after reeXML did not exist, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your toolbar (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the chosen extension of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for the script or the formatting language you like to like. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantitative; -Repository, if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we leave you, the second deal we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = Sec2.3.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html Section 2 = Section 1.html Part 1 = Unc1.html Part 1 = tag1 html tag1 = tag2 html tag1 = tag3.html Part 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree line defines the visible part of the documentation in the document-tree. for example, you can see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2: PHP 4.2,... Introduction = Measure.html... Language Reference = Basic Case,... Basic Case = Measure.basic syntax = Measure.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Please note that the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is a subordinate in tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess training (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents can be referenced to a file (and resolute at the top end of the building view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but pay attention to & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative aplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The section of the section is the range of the docrc file, which should be displayed on the scope of a & PHP; scripts in context of the functional name and pressures of Ctrl; H for context-help would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the text list (ContextList) and the file connecting lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and save in accordance with $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Organizer / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / Organa / doc for local or global use. then create a folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and worth are to be shared, please send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantitative birth; -repository. they will not be rich, but proud to be with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitlus; you are not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, tool bars with actions, scripts, scripts) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an email input, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantitative users can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them as correct and usable for the release. in order to make use of a full post that is ensured by GPG / PGP keys, for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys to enter. in the dialog new resource, the input fields have to be filled blank. (URL points can be blank) and with clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload by the DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP) tool, and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading of a resource, even before installation, examining & quantitative information. in case of problems it warns and it can be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not yet supported by & quantitlus; but the creation can be time consuming, because hundreds of tag files may be required in the day XML format. there is easier way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and conversions of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target record name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the character string, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / h e.dtd will appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP according to conversion: if enabled, produces & quantitative; according to the conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitlus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and full use of & quantitlus; this chapter is to be able to bring them with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitlus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantitative aplus; all that is selected as global, is stored in the common folder structure of & quantitative; this enables the group of administrators to secure various materials, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development aid for a single user. these are custom samples and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this may be easy to work with special actions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which provides common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantitlus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors window, the builders, the anteivites with information and the toolbar. please strike in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the Karteireites with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document set to reload, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorial Unit to another context menu regarding the processed documentation, such as basic handling steps (cut / copy / paste), using the mouse pointer or opening the file, if the string is called a file using the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editorial office, the toolbars of the editor will present itself; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantitative parameters, the tool is adapted to the new functions and thus connected user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you insert one single day, e.g. & lt; then enter the symbol that the tag represents, then you can insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert a day that has several attributes (like anchors), you can fill out various fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanometer (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information to & quantitative; to navigate it to and pass through. in the presentation of Karteireites are available for files, project, sample templates, scripts, scripts and documentation of construction purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool designed and quantitative tool. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, uploading or delete the files from the memory medium can be carried out with the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantitative is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on how they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only available in the project. more about templates can be found in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. click here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, more functions are available, such as the script to edit, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of an element the cursor is set to the position of the element. by right-click of an element it opens up a list of commands in relation to navigation and collecting of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other Baumanners. with it can change manfast attributes and namespaces. it is possible to change the content of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download your documentation for & quantitative information; the quantitative documentation can be downloaded from the quantitative documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project may be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitlus; two boxes at the bottom of the window can be reached via the usable information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document are displayed, and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartel reites shows all faults in the markup of the current document. & quantitlus; scripts that are executed, provide all error messages (such as it gives) to this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitlus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command. the tool is the possibility to define their own orders as icons in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantitlus; is the ability to send a tool bar as compressed Tar-archive via & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an e-mail, they can secure it in & quantitative; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantitative; -files to your system. in order to get a complete list of options that can be given to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & craplus; you should check whether your path does the & kde; 3 bin folders. you should also make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of its bin folder. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitlus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative aplus; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantitlus began to deal with a nearby idea: what if & quantitative markup languages would be? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative is not far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML; then you should define it & quantitative; for this, the suitable & IDE; for that.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above-mentioned claim must be noted that & quantitlus is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; Developer is not only that everything else developed? thanks to & kde; -rumours is not only this everything possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitlus; to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitlus; enables the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity continuously. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and tool bars, the automation can be almost every task. by means of the program Komar, you can realize them & quantitlus. (find out more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web-development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and has been expanded quickly to a highly-engineered editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative, Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quantitative; the original developers left the GPL license version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details related documentation is with help: / quantitative (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or co-center help: / quantitative a).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quantitative is currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon sequel @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file which is not located on it, with the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all the files as template for later use. check out in the section about templates. should you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project licence file, only a mistake is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts this special characters to & HTML for insertion, so that it can be displayed correctly and not to be understood by the browser as a form factor.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the intermediate position in & URL; -friction, which is the correct way to insert of special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for insertion of & URL; s in the anchors day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch the block-selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Direct to a line number. that is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages can be found!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or SED with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">- and switching on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantitlus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left from the main window. this column allows you to bookmark the bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will be appearing in the menu with entries predicted or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Open an existing project from the hard disk. & quantitative aplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory to new files that could be there. this enables you to copy video files to your project folder or a folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have another input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attentive settings, such as & quantitlus; the project manages. in Chapter & quantitative aplus; -projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a tool toolbar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu when you assign them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions need to be added through toolboards or you will be asked if you are asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this deletes it not from the hard disk. if you have not saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantitative point; -Team so that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the tool bar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading tool bar to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; which you have made or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantitative image; own PA format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the Entities from the & DTD; it is useful if the actions from the & DTEP; it is necessary to renew the whole & DTEP; if this global is globally and a write permission in the global KDE file is not present, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags which are loaded in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allow access to the current day application dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific underlines.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivated the smart settings of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantitative is denied by tool bar if this day is contradicted this place at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">The available plug-in menu includes the available plugins below the above-mentioned menu points. click on the link. click on an activated plugins.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the tooling mode for the current file. the list of available hermits is based on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line labels. very useful when you know people to use other OS platforms to developers. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. through some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause the switching mode, which is also the default mode, or the lower window mode, which is the representation in & quantitative image; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes one entry for each open window. the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main window on or out.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialogue includes any application which use the KHTML-Part, including the & Konqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judging the behaviour of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate; please find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which you can change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitlus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with each open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative form; -development in financial form, you find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled up at the best from top to bottom, as the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name file, file is automatically completed.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative file; -Project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small book letters (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the machine address of the machine where you want to remotely access local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the chosen log file are used. depending on the remote computer, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the template for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files for different projects should be used, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a joint collection of files for different projects should be used, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folder may be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static web content you want to download and change. if you want to download and change the script (e.g. & PHP; Python, & etc;) you have to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If the files you are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, if a project is started to start new, do not sharks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by attaching or by removing the skins, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded into the menu with Project Properties in the menu window profiles, or with the keyboards Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which are reignored in project operations such as project ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that will be loaded when opening the project. in case more about project intentions can be found.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that the desired debugger can be selected. more information on Gubed is to be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the button options. in case the error search is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the window profiles can upload high-loading profiles (see in) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile by drawing a profile view of each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be edited, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the Lower window event, one can turn the event actions, change or delete the actions, if a particular event happens, such as the example of a file. see in the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantitlus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not possible to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu Project or the icon Project open from the toolbar. the dialog box will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantitlus is closed, the project file is automatically stored. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitlus; changed files. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">There are free access to the files in the project. there, the files may be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "folder behaviour as well, however, you will need to open the entries and open the context menu with the right button of the mouse button." ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find various profiles. the profile contains information about the place of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing of the actual profile. if only a profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and forget to program. this opportunity is useful if you need to save high uploading files and save the rather unsafe password on the disk option does not occur in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative boards, many high-scale profiles can be uploaded to different servers. when working or create a profile, this dialog can be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a full qualifying domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this needs to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time saving feature or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so that it can not be read easily, but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can be uploaded into a project many views, i.e. by simply diving of view, various files and tool bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitlus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adjusting the adaptation of & quantitative; to your own working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantitlus; best on the toolbar. use and add adding. adding tool bar will be treated at the bottom of the toolbar section at the bottom of the tool.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be adjusted either by the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which you can adjust other actions such as toolbars, toolbar or toolbar can be displayed, which should be indicated in the dialog where actions are to be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">In addition to the context of the context menus for a tool (symbol) on a tool bar, the entries will be removed and the action will be displayed and the self-explanatory are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up the toolbar in the menu with settings... and set settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documentations, code-escalopes and files to link. you can copy, postpone or any of the system available existing directory in the storage space. templates are set in & quantitative; in about the restrictions you need for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative software; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of any template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be added any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; binaries are normally inserted in documents with interlink (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the template area below global templates. further information on the template's tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents may be of any text documentation. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises work in such a way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template room under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be added in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the mounting space under global templates. see for more information on templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for all websites as template. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even if it is stored as a project document) the template is not visible in the repository. check in the repository space under projectile.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and then click File As template. alternatively, select the selection available as local / project document. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and placing on the template templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only enough to copy in a template-folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and fold or insert about the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can choose the file tree or in the project files to create a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, it is secured by default, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Projections allow a very good-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and headlines, or create dynamically with & PHP; in addition, you can insert some things on using templates, in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the lower window templates is based on the files in $KDEDIR / apps / apps / quantitative / toa / template and the template. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers such as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to define the behavior of a folder with the right mouse button, click on the folder and select in the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or template. this selection is blinded as soon as the attributes can be inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and does not fit everything except for pediatrium. if a regular folder would generally be deactivated, except they would be explicitly activated. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you're probably in a family folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or below text for templates in this folder. this might be general headlines or lines for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a complete presentation by using special headlines in a folder with a special headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have an context menu (pointing right mouse button) over a full control collection for adding folders, or copy and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitlus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor will replace the source editor by the VPL; -Editor and the second, the editors window in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he will load a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and check if necessary to the source code editor, in which they are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">In working with VPL, editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL, editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor, is still necessary to edit the code editor. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes are displayed in the source text editor and the Cursor in the source text editor and the VPL; -Editor is activated, this mode is already active, the key pressure is the active cursor from a window to others, where the position is preserved in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... According to your choice of VPL; it can be set automatically between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small range for quick computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the processing of invisible tags at work with VPL; -Editor is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this means that the reduction of the hands of the hands can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allows the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of the content, e.g. keywords in the column name and keyword keys keyword 2 on the contents -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of the design of the design of pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons below the list or delete it. a change on the list is exactly like the meta elements possible. the processing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling device by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursors is as in a text processing, possible due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is unique. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by inserts and be deleted using remote control or removal times.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way as the source editor, as in the source text editor. it is necessary to note that the insertion of tags already existing identical tags are not removed, such as a anchor-day, surround with text, every other surrounding anchor must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars such as tables assistent or the Listen-assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; they will work in this release the tables or lists tool bar must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for analysis of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles, search for certain elements is possible and the design of the styles can be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Um & xsldbg; successfully compile, need except & knot; nor the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml that are available with a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Hold in a template, at a location in one of xsldbg charged styles- or xml file or at the current nodes. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb mode compatibility mode can be set to set up points in a certain file and line number and later be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path out of a filename as a file name. filenames in the same folder as the top file name file names with relativity icon. / en / xsldoc.xsl is charged, the following input is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, this command will be checked for a partial or complete agreement with a preage called QNAP ME or a specified modulation name. & eg; template agrees with any QNAP ME, which contains the string.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why so & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had correcting the settings at the same time. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the altered lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the objection was changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in one line and changes to white characters. later, any number of useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, you can copy it easily into the intermediate window and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a fully-contained file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way interactions are fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently from each other part of a piece of coding and displays changes. in this editor you can even edit the outcome. in this editor you can even edit the results directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& # diff3; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; the exact differences are similar to the possibilities of this color monitors. if you often have to check the check, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines are shown only in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the Summary in the column on the left side. (no annoying more, if a certain one changes the one.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicate that file is different. red color means that both files may differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can complete the tipping work by simply write the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder crankdiff3 folders 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual inserting of filenames, the selection over the file browser (file...) or the select a last open file. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also select a folder when selecting a folder when a file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If connections are connected, the input field is active for the purpose and you can process. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The single button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the intermediate position into the active comparative window. the comparison starts immediately. in open-dialog you don't need to select files, you can simply connect the dialog with the button button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and finish: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind? sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to figure out what these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would need to copy two corresponding files, then paste them into & kdiff3; now you can easily copy the relevant sections, insert and compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can do nothing from & kdiff3; only the skins of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and pick up text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case, your original data could perish.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (please note that Windows C is optional). (if the path leads to a file, let the mouse give a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source flags are the letters A, B and C assigned to the three sources. a colour is blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, the color file distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in Settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text, the column shows the corresponding color. with some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that divides the merge column by the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks is activated, the line will be picked into broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the reference windows) also has a info line with the inscription:, the filename and [the changes] if you have edited the result. usually it contains the automatic interactions already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the store is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to next dissolved / unks conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisions can be used, each difference is also to be solved by a conflict that has to be solved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear. (this will also be a jump in the position inside the windows where the group is not visible.) This group will then highlighted the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes no further line remains in the group; then in these lines the text will be displayed; no line is displayed in the box; this text appears either in the final stored file, nor in a mark you may copy and add anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge tracking; however, if you copy such text from the result window, you will be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources to ignore the numbers, or ignore Ignorms C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates to the image, you can also use the keyboard, but you can also use the keyboard, right, high, down, side down, side, at the beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl end, siw as you are also used by other programs. click here to navigate to the vertical image bar.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in section Commissions and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl image) or to the next / previous conflict. note that, and not automatically soldered conflicts has to be regarded as a conflict. hence, the conflict must be distinguished between soluble and soldering conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the selection into the intermediate position, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Strg-Insert). if this is enabled, you will automatically copy the copying button and the manual copy drops. be careful with this option, because you could not overwrite the contents of the intermediate situation accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenends are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX versions use a line-up character\, and Win32-based systems use the line-up + Zeilenfeeder\\ r\. Kdiff3 retains the line settings of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will automatically be stored and restored at the next start. (menu Adjusti- &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a writing with fixed width. (on some systems also the dialog box with variable width on the selection, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in cursive lettering. if the selected script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be gerastically shown. in these systems, the button Preferences will automatically create an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is activated, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the table button. otherwise, a table character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or press Return, the back line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied into the middle shelf. the manual copy into the intermediate position is then removed.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files, & kdiff3; first, all complete identical lines are to be found in the source file. only during that first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares white characters. in this step white characters are not ignored. white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car switch '\\ r' and a line preference '\' at the end of one line, but then you could adjust files with different sizes on the side, but then you may be treated differently with different sizes. during the merge this option is disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters are ignored. in the results, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic-passing mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next ungarest conflict is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automated all conflicts in white signs by the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. note that the automatic selection can also ignore the numbers or comment on numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ignorms C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and implementing a merge. look for details under documentation for the list of documentation and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version is the Suffix .original file if already a backup file with the Suffix .original exists, this is deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. this option does not affect the current current program. you must finish & kdiff3; terminate and re-start to change the change. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally above the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top settings will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for the encoding appears a short notice that is the local coding. (this can't be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files with different coding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define what encoding can be used to store.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may not be Unicode, but the previous command command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII).</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress Hervorings of changes in white characters in the text or oversight. (note: this applies also to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore the numbers or add IgnorkC / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may see only the differences between two files. after selecting from A & lt; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; C is indicated by the normal still a second overthrowing column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space available on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Specify the comparison chart next to each other. this can also be useful to ads of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and decide how to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and use the filenames of the last source file as a preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to start the merge command, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will first be delivered to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command itself is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example, to cut-off parts or correction it settings.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is specified firstly to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), the command of the command is only used with the line code. you can write your own bonus processor which meets exactly your requirements. every input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable user more flexibility when setting the diff performance. however, an external program needs, and most users don't want to program itself. however, the good news is that in most cases SED or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\ 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern by default: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with SED, you might need to understand it and perhaps you may even use this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar items.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it's good as an example of another pre-processing command for line settings. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the requirements from each other. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Error / switches' allergy is required at perl some details. where SED\\ (and\\) needs only (and) without the previous "\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal pre-processor are retained for viewing and merge. the further operations only change the data, which sees the line-like algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the Zeilenabo preprocessor uses the output of the normal pre-processor as a input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changes or hidden differences, you cannot notice certain differences in particular, and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder stimulating and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... for each object a proposal to merge; you can customize the suggestion before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and displays the simulated changes, without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads to selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparative and merge of individual files. you need to specify the folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will not start automatically. to start the merge, select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow).</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will be informed of a small news window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files are listed, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning process is completed, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder was found during the scan, click here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally displayed together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or on the object double clicking on the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all signatory valves and fold all subdirectories with which you can open or folding all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file extensions will start and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the data type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the contact clock action cannot be chosen automatically. if the coupling is started, you will be informed about any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors are red, green, yellow and black in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their total content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders the age is insignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many nautical files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set using a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems you have a precursor point attribute. in other file systems a previous point is selected as hidden. this option you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element name or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If links to folder: if the option is switched off, the links how normal folders will be treated and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recruitment. a link to a folder signify and & kdiff3; if this option is switched off.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of soluble, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and substantially slower when it is applied to files that does not contain any text. (enter an appropriate Anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, you may get faster, only the change date and the file size. however, this speed costs you make a certain measure of security. please do not use caution. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly as confidential date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical. that can be useful when copying the modified date. please do not use caution. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folders are selected. in this mode, the proposals will be selected, that later both folders are identical. the results from merge files are stored in both folders. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, there will be the copying of the newer file as an action. (this is considered unsure, because the other file doesn't change too.) This option is switched off in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by a file or deleted, then the original version is renamed. if an old backup file is already deleted, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also applies the normal merge of individual files, not only the associated whole folder. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the file merge command will be visible into the merge of individual files; you can switch to the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to switch the window divider in the window menu and switch between the directory and the text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file with double-click. however, you can also convert a single file together without the folder. once you save the result, the status will be put on, and the file will not run again if you start the folder.</seg>

<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should you notice:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively small or... that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder. then a file will always be used as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note the option to trust the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being used as a differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first in the built-in differences. to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then choose In Kdiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part file, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiffuser 3Part. please note that this does not work if no of the original files exist. Moreover, this is unreliable if the original files have been changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as Part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the same of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it is commendable). Moreover, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can result merging the diff3 program from the diff tool utility collection.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You can not find the program compiled from the sources and the configure script in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you can find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are more than identical; but if only a non-white sign is differently, the line will be as the same as not the same. Notto Each other, this is the same of this is the but this is of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this important information will however be lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store these information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large. you can reproduce a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to process bigger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly cooled; No src lints; released and the text can't erase. what does it mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to produce differences. even more emphasis would be confused and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use & kdiff3 functions; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes you can find under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the basic folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is available to the folder in your system, where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; Autoconf and automatic make use, you should not have problems with compiling. if you have problems occur, please report on the & kde; -mailinglists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or envelopes) and delete the selected text. insertion (Ctrl-V or switch Insert) add the text from the intermediate position at the current cursor position or replacing the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to restart the folder with the function updated.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folders do not already exist in the target folder. if the target folders do not already contains, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is probably changed in later program version).</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the panel (if they are already available), they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktop spaces. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the workspace, its size to finish it or move it. this works both within an operating area as well as at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can show all virtual desktop space as well as in the current applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop area and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the medium mouse button you can move windows within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a working area as well as other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu has only clicked the two entries of Pager. however, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on working area and end. the following commands behave the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the working area. only appears when an application was clicked onto the application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when an application has been clicked onto an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, window within the & Kpager; s can be moved to the working area and can also be moved to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, you will be shown in the & Kpager; the names of the virtual space is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktop space. it is crossed together with name, the names are provided with ordination, & eg; 1st floor space.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each working area will also be displayed as a background in & mupager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows at the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty space will appear to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window. note: pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & ball bearings can be determined: classic leaves & Kpager; in a 2xn-grid, like from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal display shows all virtual desktop areas in a horizontal range, which is very good for the presentation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager miniature program in the control system. it has the advantage that it can display windows as icons or with its content and postpone. furthermore, it runs out of the control panel.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and subsequent selecting from switch settings... allows the dialog for Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this can not be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually, manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or viv. if you don't have a write permission to file the file or login to your system administrator. in this file, you have to register the key windowtransparent mode and assign to this one value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can hide the pain when using the mouse, and helping to use so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you should look back pain that use your computer with the use of your computer if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to show it once again: even if & kmousetool may avoid pain which occur when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain which applies through the mouse because of the mouse. the result may fall differently for each of the ergonomic tools.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; supervised your mouse movements and makes a mouse click when you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move is enabled, power & kmousetool; a break after it is done by the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse. in this way you can run the pulling out of the mouse button. intelligent shifts requires a little exercise but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">After the end of the mouse movement, this break-time must be stopped before & kmousetool; a mouse click leads.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should make sure that places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on the browser window that does not constitute a link, does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckles, you should clean your mouse. that's normally quite easy. the trick is quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles you get into contact with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse. like this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be very clear if you watch the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the filtering and the contamination can easily scrape with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the design of & kmousetool; if you just use a wrong step. if you use this case, this means that & kmousetool does not mean; the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you are able to execute a mouse click. herein, the status of & kmousetool is reset; back and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to perform mouse clicks and put the cursor at another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there, where you want to make it. but you can park your mouse on a neutral area of working area when you do not want to create a key mouse click here. safe zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey surfaces are the toolbar and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart shifts, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent shifts is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is highly likely to move it into the intermediate button or move into any other action, where you can only cause problems to prepare. but there are some advice to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifts when you just start to start & kmousetool; set the text instead of a mouse click and hold the switch-key button while moving the mouse button to the other end of the text and press the mouse button there again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will be every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button lets you play a sound like a mouse click. later, you can also use smart shifts without using the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">Um & kmousetool; to be used, the Xtest extension has to be installed for & X Window; this should be the case at most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers, and it is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer short. this program was developed for people who are suffering from the RSI syndrome, and to those of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured as a certain time that a pulling process begins to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, pulling and pick up with the mouse can also be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to select text for a language requirement. this standard contains stamps for the control of voices, speaking speed, the volume, the sex's voice and the pitch. furthermore marks for the control of the language requirement.

<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following limitations are:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) because this is the default voice, the festival used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100nbsp; the SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filter (SDB filters). thus, the first sentence has to be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also start or terminate the card ticket orders, or start or stop off, even if the language synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional detection filter. at the first start of & nts; it is automatically set up as a set of the propositional detection filter. you can change its settings or add additional Satislimits filter, but will not be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the simplest, you will learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying. switch on the card card orders, changing some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes. for this purpose, you have to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& nts; then faster with the reading can start, as only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop writing jobs on the card card or break, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal typing filter filter is automatically set up when you run down trough access to the first time. it cannot be removed, only if you do not change this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set the propositional detection filter and add a tabulatory filter (Decimal code 8) to the propositional borders (Decimal code 8) to the proposition borders automatically from the text. note that the standard propositional limits filter can keep the fonts.</seg>
<seg id="2734">The SBD Filter will never be applied on & kde; messages (kg.), warnings, messages or the issue of Screen-Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from Versions the normal Satislimits filter, you can insert it again by load the file standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map Speaker selection, you can write the Speaker settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>

<seg id="2741">Mark this check box, if the property is to have priority before other characteristics. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor at the stand, it will always be used as a priority feature. the only case where you may specify the attribute language, if you know that a specific application text is sent in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr falls immediately when it is started. I've compiled Debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Gstreamer is thrown down and & tts. probably you have to register Gstreamer. if the problem is not solved, probably a non-compatible version of Gspreamer is installed. you can try to upgrade or uninstall Gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA will not work when I play music with another application. if I stop a text job, friert & tts; a message on the & console; it appears on the & console, which says: to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts can occur at ALSA, which can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. for possible solutions you will find on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-projected ect.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice to the festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in festival but kttsmgr indicates that voice does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map audio, there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program SOX must be installed and can be found on the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermodulus such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the Speaking speed are ignored when & tts; & HTML; (that is aware that the HTML 5 is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or if you are very courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to-SSML inverter, and set the Speach speed up.</seg>

<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Day Sable Gender does not seem to work. so the festival does not produce an error, the XSL file rejects the convert from SSML to Saber the gender tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>

<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical surface can be used as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but in addition, development plans for libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should make this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about fundamental network technology are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; Changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been found great spread. IPv6 is expected in the near future. this description is currently concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; this network is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can't be used as any case, the IP address can't be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a very small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific plan to avoid IP address consignments to the global network (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses are used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mask mask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so all computers are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the standard route is needed for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The power address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to one of the so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be dynamically modified at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised when in case of active DSL connections, another content is set to be found there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to create a surface for the quick, selective equipment. the second purpose was the responsibility of a question that my wife introduced: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spreadout the band and reads the pretense information of the tape. detects & kdat; the reader on the tape will not be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the reader, search it according to the correct index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything has been smooth, the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the tape is mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before releasing the tape, first the integration must be solved, there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; through a change of symbol for the tape, that the integration for the band was solved and shows a message for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; it can be used by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band types must be formatted before you can use to store data. this process does not match the formatters at & dat; this process does not need to be formatted before you are formatched by the band of & kdat; usually a formatting of the tape predict, DAT drives however.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after the formation of the formations, the tape is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you'll need to select the to secure files. that can be done on three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a securing profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a heme. only the selected files and / or subfolders are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog box settings for backup. in this dialogue, you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archive for the drive. only the selected file or folder was checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in one of the archive for the tape. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>

<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for review, the dialog appears overchecking. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can access the restore, the files that are to be recovered will be marked. this can be done on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with one block. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>

<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog appears to restore settings. in this dialogue, you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears to recover. this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process and the data transfer and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexfile on the basis of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here is a securing profile with the just marked files and default settings. you can also make the following settings for a securing profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder where the backup should be carried out. the list of files to be secured automatically is automatically updated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all file that are listed under the backup files listed on the same file system, as the folder. folders, which are located on other file systems, you can enter separately under the backup files. each entry is considered independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files saved since then changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the command of tar. this causes that all files will be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for tape drives (normally / dev / tape). this path needs to point to the non-reared version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted to the drive. in some drives this is necessary, before reading or writing operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tries and dat; it may not work at the belt drive. possibly this setting is not working with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape is unmounted, automatically the tape is unmounted. use this option not using Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try and dat; the hardwarfare block size for tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must report & kdat; in any case, you have to communicate the blocking size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this character is host name: seconds, whereby calculating the full name of the system was formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has been formatted since the epoch.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat / file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be stored directly with & GNU; - tar, even other tar versions should work as long as it is not in mental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksysteme log; is a & kde; viewing for systems logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users where you can get information on your system or where the system allows you to control the various protocol files. additionally, allow & ksysteme log; experienced users to quick access for example on any problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kshaft log; helps users to understand what your computer makes in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information on your system or where the system is set out the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksysteme log; experienced users to access the quick access for example on any problems that occur on their server. & ksysteme log; therefore tries to allocate some advanced features which can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol-files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 features & ksysteme log; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen image, introduces & ksysteme log; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol-lines of a protocol-file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the launch of the system log log, first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol will not be displayed, so you don't have a small news window, so you'll find under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user no entitlement to reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or according to the specified strings. in the default setting, the select box contains the select entry. in the default setting, the select line will only appear, if in one of the columns contain the drawing chain of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol-search term, select the column process protocol and then enter the name of a process, so it shows you & kshaft log; all protocol-lines which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default settings and helps you to recognize the important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of stage errors are displayed with a noticeable color as protocol-lines of the level notice. the colour display of protocol-lines can be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to view only certain process (e.g. in system protocol or in cron protocol), you can then use the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command as for example to the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to activate new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all new next protocol-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kshaft log; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subfters. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional subwindows. once you selected a window, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kshaft log; has its own website on http: / / ksysteme log.forum-software-software-software. place you find more current information about reference sources of & kshague;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& kshaft log; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & sysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init develops quickly to the standard for controlling the program starts at the start of the system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I don't want to go on to historical aspects (among others, because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init Binary file is therefore under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone can try a machine on system V init without a new installation and new format. this is why you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of right in / etc. this folder called rc.d. place rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start using the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things such as setserial, NFS, & Sendmail; system services do not include such things such as setserial, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use of it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see one line in the beginning area as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can toss a glance into the second column and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can manually repair the inittab changes. if you have anything through each other, you will manually repair the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start to enter all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop system services? very simple: each of the script is written so that it's a argument like startup and stop. you can actually start this script by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script will stop with the argument stop. if he contains a S, the script will be called by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to create a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running Runlevel, the only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & sysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not trivial: draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also change scripts between laps or change the position within one level by moving it anywhere else. this happens only then if the entry will be out of its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if you draw an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you prefer to move this into a new section. to select it only on a new runlevel, you must choose from the context menu or add from the context menu and then in the target range settings -- even then, if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding items before you try to add the system.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore records that have been thrown into the recycle bin. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the table button to activate the various worksectors (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">In order to postpone entry into another round level, use it into the intermediate level (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry manually, press the input key to switch between different fields. close the dialog button to accept the changes, or press Esc to cast the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; modifications to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the Standard Runners, and now the machine starts up constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; available under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services in these distributions, does not simplify the configuration for proprietary purposes programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check whether all configuration files are available (and even if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just do without message when their configuration files are not available or set up false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save it. either use the relevant icon of the toolbar or the entry into the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user list list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears on the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have limited system settings (Quota), a card card will appear on which you can make individual settings, if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Ticket card password appears if shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card is only appears where for at least one second file system limit (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the quotia.user / quotas group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected with the help of the field filesystem with space limit</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups are informed about the selected users of the selected user. the standard group that belongs to the user can be found in the field of Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting this in large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog box features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, add adding to the user or group or click on the matching buttons button of the toolbar. the edit or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can add the LILO BootManager to remove the boot password, remove the time up to boot of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify, change, change and more.</seg>
