although I visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally big .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , I have picked up American music , American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had a similar effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the local conspiracy of a oil painting with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura student who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so inviting you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even had written a very sh@@ atter@@ y love letter over his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me , as he is dealing with his engagement .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful .
he says , what he thinks , like a former colleague , express his express , and explained publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American and Women .
yet people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won with Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support these big@@ s person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring down Tr@@ ump and his voters in harmony with the people that I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , receives people from all over the world , a deeply glorious human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps has also agreed not to agree with the editor of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ toler@@ ances is also reflected in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr which figh@@ ts for their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
yet it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es that always helped me with much patience and suffering from me and my colleagues helped us to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er council helped me much in my career .
those people and those committed by them pre@@ per@@ ated my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump has b@@ agu@@ ed his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that it was the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its contemp@@ t to non @-@ white people .
the con@@ frontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost the heart beat me .
maybe it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump voters as a r@@ assi@@ sts .
to in@@ arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to the situation .
that is super@@ fici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think of a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most , are white , have voted for tr@@ ump , because they want to re @-@ win control of a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ itt@@ eth the cruel decision , comm@@ enting a man who looks down with contemp@@ t to those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ no@@ d. ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ref@@ usal to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in white in connection to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what the big Van Jones called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what faith , or background you may always have , America &apos;s welcome .
for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ er , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white American of this promise and says : to hell with many , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
at all these things I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd of human beings .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; have Muslims in a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the quantity .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone who is not so like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an impressive and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , is it not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was depos@@ ed .
the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , told the message .
and all the people who like this like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that break@@ eth me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music that played at both places is not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the refuse
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump located just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among the tourists , but worlds away from nearby villages and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Music ban@@ ger ) has been playing in the community : one of the children and adults of the symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a possibility for over@@ coming poverty .
a school @-@ school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the congregation , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the ban@@ ker violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hopes .
the young band members take their duties towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI means :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to reflect her great passion .
they always come and play with gl@@ os@@ sy eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ l , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically the top of the biggest waste dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of Paraguay , which are made of re@@ compens@@ ated waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ ins , C@@ elli , gu@@ it@@ ars , sa@@ ils , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , which were all produced from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez recalls a local oil biolog@@ ist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , in the initial time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the gar@@ bage . they didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed slightly as F@@ avi@@ o something which he had never seen before : a made of waste made out of waste .
today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made from recovered material , called The Recycling Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) features the musical performance on :
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest , like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they will transform it in something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspired show of gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music by Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully .

this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that provides targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the publication happens in the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated in li@@ aison waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly high above accordingly , and inclined little to call a criminal law to their coasts on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the commission@@ er , Mozambique and the Seychelles rapidly opposed the ship . they refused to get one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries which all refused to be refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing industry . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and pursued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia because of pill@@ aging the country &apos;s stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries stop ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar around six countries , who then had driven the premi@@ er out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are to be able to work together . they exchange information and stand mut@@ ually at where there are illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding is illegal . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is tra@@ pped , it is hidden because it is extremely difficult because illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the obvious abuse of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems will harm a del@@ ay@@ ing balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ob@@ stru@@ cted by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ dles and through the snow @-@ emp@@ i@@ ck@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions nowadays happen in real @-@ time , tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries , for example , exchange lists of existing licenses , or details that , during a harbour spec@@ tion , can be noticed or experienced .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very att@@ entive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fishing in forbidden areas . even so susp@@ ects driving routes - about such that suggest that a ship invites his caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case such studies show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal catch @-@ catch can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports , which means that ships can &apos;t sell their cargo load , and that they could even be forced to pay the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then a significant financial losses for the owner , what means illegal fishing is finan@@ cially worthwhile anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advis@@ er company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to gain a loss of USD 20 million to lost revenues , who lost eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters .
East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fishing in East Africa , which attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these even illegal fishermen .
among other practices , among other things , actions can count as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , specification of imagination , the fish protected species and fish in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation with the lack of international cooperation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in former times a ship could be illegal and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You reject my port not running . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legitim@@ ate gor@@ p@@ inch tried to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investig@@ ative ships .
it has been exposed to criminal networks which f@@ ake the f@@ ake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has been persecuted and found it .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing across great distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i , the susp@@ ect ships more precise .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be refined , helps un@@ loading the illegal ships to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ fan@@ aly@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can &apos;t be stored by satellite .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information panels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each individual tracking ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ amm@@ un@@ un with the neighbors , to get a better image of it , who does what does it makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run on which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but also refresh them .
ships used so@@ oner without a license and hardly have to be reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now sold a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fish@@ eries has more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were mounted on board tow@@ ing network , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; the effect is so strong that we can also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study of study . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing .
there are six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . however , they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With safety , even more such initiatives and structures may also be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member Somalia could report his first great triumph in October : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was traveling under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and have been banned in the meantime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was still in banned waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking the rules of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such special , collabor@@ ative occupational collabor@@ ative work is actually working in the entire world . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . in Venezuela , the situation in Venezuela arises : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to conquer the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of strong demonstrations .
they are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the resignation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the Government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on referendum , the Venezuel@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they gathered themselves together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return order of Venezuela ) can be found in both pictures from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst other things in the rural district of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the north @-@ north federal federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva as@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country wor@@ sen@@ ed continuously , which makes itself the everyday life of Venezuel@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medic@@ ations .
many representatives of the opposition saw the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , however , the off@@ setting of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the context of the government decree as follows :
as part of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and economic crisis has been among the highest around the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % on the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to aband@@ on its institutional structures and to close its institutional structures .
the election campaign Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica , or short mud ( approximately : round Table of the Democratic unit ) , who joined the opposition from the opposition to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . in addition , a twelfth hour strike on the torture day , Venezuel@@ an government seat , scheduled to continue the block@@ age of the referendum on 3 November , should continue to continue .
the appeal was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national country , and on 3 November all in Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time are witn@@ essing a overwhelming participation in people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ators that calls through the protection of protection : &quot; you will kill me because I have hunger ? &quot;

on Twitter many pictures , talking about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ation .
particularly large waves beat the news about police raid in the central town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the prot@@ esters moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government &apos;s own statement , in front of the police and armed advoc@@ acy of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t bear co@@ ats , as one could see something else , what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic design makes the round that forms the extent of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a office procedure in question - this was shown in the eyes of many in@@ numer@@ able people on the streets .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Labs for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado asser@@ t that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed .
here is your office building !
on the street !
other values are these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made out of their perspective little against the devastating economic crisis and prefer@@ able to leave critical votes .
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more than frequency and intensity .
some of the Venezuel@@ ans reported to the media they are too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was conducted on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in Qui@@ j@@ ano as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
beginning with the burden to bear the same name as his father to bear the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he has suffered enough .
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation then I thought that it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child of 15 years we don &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I couldn &apos;t know that my father was a thief , Fol@@ terer and rob@@ bers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ sen@@ ator . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , who was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who knew the extent of the atro@@ cities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy , who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent of his child and like this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the Sports Hall to the Military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had che@@ ered myself with a boy , the mar@@ tial sport .
all named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are a wicked hole , you have made you friends with one of the ER@@ P .
pass only that they don &apos;t have a day , and I must save you .
the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he banned me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me at the military base .
he told me I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because my father had moved me .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university inclu@@ sions , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ aganda , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ dah , the prisoners will be tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he made me waiting at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
all of them was stolen .
he gave me a little in a blanket , and commanded me to take it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack , where the stolen objects were shut down and held me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ ams in , and saw a song that were tor@@ tured on man .

later I found out that it was attached to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was just en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed there .

the st@@ ank there was dirty there ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I knew the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked myself , how is it possible that a man can sorry for another so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father brought me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and to bind ocular .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also accused in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were bound with the face down - all were bound at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people stopped quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; Why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and killed by soldiers , and was buried .
I know this because my father spoke at home .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man and killed there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process , students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former fol@@ ks chambers .
the way to which you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of ab@@ stain@@ ing .
when they had survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of up came to be moved .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things to home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - how they called it - was .
but when I was even during the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that the spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military signs which you have fought against an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ ve , then this is not a war@@ fare but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked how my father , the leader of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime , and I answered , And thou that se@@ duce you cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and destroy you .
for this we need no other one !
thus my father was .
I have not only good memories of him .
when I started out in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a wheel pul@@ lover of wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence asked me to have compassion for this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down to me for load what they wanted .
I was there anyway to speak .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last advent@@ u@@ rous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I &apos;m re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you only have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and recognize that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed so during the dictatorship of Man , but why the bodies disappear ?
why children de@@ duce ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have just been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
had these men not even families , which could be handed over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last remote act that you can do with a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and lost somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father .
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clari@@ fy : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea , to show my Father , was created during a meeting when he stood under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the things I had to do so because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt sorry , and asked me , why the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , was really good .
then I cried :
how can you say anything to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me to participate in a child .
he said only &quot; Na then draw me up . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I charged the first ad .
finally , I knew that he was a break@@ er .
no one can submit to me that I am default . I finally have spoken against my own father .

an translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the shield with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto where you can extend his driving licence .
this photo was dissemin@@ ated in the social media .
arrangement of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Japanese word ( co@@ vet sh@@ a ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps too , but also translated with evil hin@@ ts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September in the input field and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was also att@@ entive to the local time .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n was published in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an exc@@ use for older people and in an international city as K@@ YO@@ TO just in@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; the drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gramm@@ ar not quite correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced .
the police pre@@ fecture were exc@@ used in the Kyoto period . furthermore , they stated that the error was already contained in the text which they had received from the translator and that the translation was not tested for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , that older people felt ag@@ gra@@ ded with in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News was somewhat detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was en@@ acted as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are still involved in accidents .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for instance , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.8@@ 03 recorded a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this puts their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of seniors caused by seniors over the same period has risen .
named as named repor@@ ter , published on Yahoo released version of the article comments on the Light , which show the advantages of a few Japanese apparently opposed to older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the translation is actually not at all , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; in all Asia is so common
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true place of discovery for these bizar@@ re errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are diverse .
to transition , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active retention of the target language - something that is in the native languages of the case . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the source language - native language .
thus , a French native language should translate into French French French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue to produce translations into English . this may be a lack of understanding for the transfer , reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers who are to learn from Japanese .
some companies that even have no foreign staff , have translations made of proprietary , then the Japanese staff , whose knowledge of English as the best ones , are made to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the promised propositions which are created by machine translations will show that this technology can not replace any human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the strange English formulation in Japan , among them also decorate the r@@ enti@@ ful prints , which are often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for style reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harm@@ less or at least harm@@ less . but of great companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more accurate translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and security measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ber@@ con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Frei@@ es Sur@@ fs ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezuel@@ an Internet users informed that they don &apos;t have access to the online broadcast@@ er Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet recording of VP@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV could not be accessible anymore .
other online transmitters were also presented by the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ position@@ ally groups , which was opposed to the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the leaders of the Parliament had transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is glu@@ ed , and recommended to use the U@@ sers , VPN ( Virtual Private Networks ) to access access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activate your VPN .
it seems that Internet @-@ Venezuel@@ an providers are again blocked again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezuel@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been de@@ ferred on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with monetary policy and closure when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I have logged in at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ filtr@@ ate was later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay may not be accessible through a lock@@ out of the domain name System ( DNA ) , but also two further online transmitter . this also applies the website to transfers their sessions .
previous investigations by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group of digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider will be using DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS server in@@ quiries should have been in@@ correct .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server does not respond or denied the request when calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ ap@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ VP@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at VP@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ per@@ ched channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the VP@@ IT@@ V @-@ Camera El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who took the protests in Caracas live in detention .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and VP@@ IT@@ V went on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections . therewith , the Venezuel@@ ans will continue to continue access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls will go to slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ mp@@ ita as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina was fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts the witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by cur@@ ator , published by Global Vo@@ ices with courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; fet@@ al cows , falling schools &quot; ) that will be processed and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family that lived there .
just before her academic degree at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house full of pride of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something of something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas they are called in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money over her less year old son or her younger daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must never pay for countless days of house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the framework of a contract which is not able to lift up .
this practice was widely used as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating from studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that figh@@ ts for the rights of boys and girls .
she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected stuff , re@@ worked and den@@ ounced .
they tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ mp@@ ed , guarantees generally not silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double de@@ formation , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who make their daughter in the faith that they are able to complete their position in society , improve their position in society and make &quot; something of itself &quot; to make a different family . &quot;
on the other hand , the family that receives the girl with him and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fying with the faith that they would give someone a chance that would not have been trained and perhaps even was star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience a lot of years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon which takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households in January 2016 , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former members of the former members of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer in the residents of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in her home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck the invasion on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported about the incident .
they were con@@ cre@@ ted that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
as UNICEF or C@@ aller@@ cu@@ ela , the deeply moved in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go practice responsible for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there will be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded an extensive investigation of the case .
they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo .
if the case is in case of judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be welded - if the first time in the history of Paraguay was a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before the Court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for workers , they also live isolated from other girls in her age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register and her father had lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the work and began to sell money on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to share the time that you still stayed for learning .
it stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , they pur@@ ged the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and the infected ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they were finished with learning , the more free time they had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says that she had to be hungry , but also won &apos;t be unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch me more books from the house of the house as food from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the master of the owner , a inhibit@@ ing military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings of the master of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and leading article from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them , to give no faith to the reports of the official media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held her for intelligent , but didn &apos;t listen to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master of the house had found someone to hear , while he spoke concerning politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would have heard there again &quot; bad habits , &quot; which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , at home again their native language Guaran@@ i would speak .
the Lord feared the creation that they had enabled them to lose , she explains .
however , it was completely clear that they had paid for them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated in the school . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken are mob@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who cri@@ es Cri@@ ad@@ itas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was unable to invite anyone home to me . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friends were created , I felt particularly clearly that I was one of any group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group in which you can really show reviews for cleaning staff and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay .
the administration in the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companions for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please refer to you .
start from Monday , when possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Brun@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleventh year girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Bi@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty . &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary a girl was written by &quot; a girl from the country inside , which would like to work . &quot;
then , the author turned into the ad once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with it .
thank you , I write again , if something is .
the business was finished .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ Ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of witness statements , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z writes :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( an practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and to their &quot; married women . &quot; this is why we are still willing to re@@ prove that many girls and boys enter into a system of slavery , where they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understand the phenomena of phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill is writing by Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to draft law on the regulations concerning the use of the use and use of social networks .
if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register to use social media in Egypt in a governmental office to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law it would be set up a place that is commissioned to use citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users would have to register within the site of the site with their right name and personnel numbers to use social networks .
if it will be missed to do this , this might take a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine money .
the bill , consisting of six paragraphs , consists in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defined social media as &quot; every application which runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear when the draft law is going through , as Egyptian authorities shall not raise the user to date . un@@ clear is also that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on level of social media enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Sad@@ ar , parliamentary committee and conve@@ y@@ ors of the Legislative Decree , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password &quot; to come across the fire@@ wall , the Facebook has blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egyptian and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt strongly in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they were for@@ ci@@ bly to control physical public and private spaces that could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , this means that they will apply a strong monitoring system to filter a citizen or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to bring them to a court process .
this is technically very realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft agreement has to be discussed at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary session .

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of the Iraqi , the animal leg H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization in Nature is to protect the spiritu@@ ally Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are not endangered due to Wil@@ s@@ making , loss and frag@@ mentation of their life &apos;s life and because they are always less prey .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as Raz@@ a in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the prosp@@ er of the ecos@@ ystems also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards in the wild bo@@ g@@ gan run is small and goes against zero . when the team in video shows that it is a recording of a big cat in the camera all , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ ation , Raz@@ a passi@@ on@@ ately like another side of their country that consists not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature AG for six years .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is making sure that protection zones to wildlife will be set up in the Kurdistan Region .

in early March 2017 , documented in nor@@ theastern Japan , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years have been hit by the &quot; Thir@@ dly catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an extensive earthquake , tsunami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a few pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the tsunami had van@@ ish all coastal towns of the map .
still the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made in local perspective for six years , to re @-@ establish the lives of local @-@ based companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper comprises both statistics of the Japanese revival authority and the survey results of the persons concerned .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitute for spare parts ( to @-@ it is to be in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ata has completed 75 percent of such buildings , whereas at 70 percent , I@@ w@@ ata is due to the final light .
similarly , you are still trying to settle for six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ ap@@ ag ( to which of which is to be cas@@ u@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ way catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emer@@ ges , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been successful on this occasion , whereas more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ation , which had been evacu@@ ated according to the disaster in the pension , were moved into definitive homes .
for I@@ th@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
of work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , their doors again opened up to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of fish@@ eries are resumed their use in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tsunami and atomic disaster took place in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land large area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 690 acres of 5 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima country , are located in the nuclear pl@@ ywood zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered far again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains a far off again .
the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened here , on the other hand , only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it was more difficult to earn their lives .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous grants among the native population and the evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the state of restoration and also how their reception has changed over the tsunami risk .
in its introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey by more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken in order to be preparing to be prepared for future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done .
how it stands for those who had been evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has directed their attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima didn &apos;t only need to see the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness to the worst , disa@@ stro@@ us accident that had to be experienced in Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
after the 2017 stand of 2017 there is still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ation areas in the disaster areas are most of the evacu@@ ated hausen , older than 50 years old . they have to prevent the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this involves construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one knows often that a more connects than it appears on the first sight .
this global connections are important as they demand out our advantages , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let &apos;s look at exactly this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep po@@ d@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention than they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very heavily connected to someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ pp@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i speaks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was supplied this week in the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer was defeated at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against spar@@ ks .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fac@@ tions .
doctors involved him on this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial com@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread within a few days fast in Brazil .
in the pictures it is also recogni@@ z@@ able to recognize the face of police officers , who identified with an impact on strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would be a police officer of a prot@@ esters and landing at the intensive care station , his face would be visible on television for six months and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ g@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz recorded video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several plum@@ bing briefly came to him hur@@ ry .
another video of the same scenes , but filmed by a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to stay a portion of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to remain in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been dealt several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for a further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was assassin@@ ated by his father , only in order to crimin@@ alize the military police in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who had been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stroke .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where the brutal police officers came on Friday at the last Friday .
police officers were in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber floor and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) bes@@ ee@@ ching the police via loud@@ speakers in violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests have missed the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window pul@@ ley .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically a frag@@ ile glass windows to illustr@@ ate a photo with a photo of their cover pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special matter .
this also needs to recognize , if one is strictly protected against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also gets an absur@@ d , disp@@ ro@@ por@@ tion@@ ate importance , and the typical powers of the military police are de@@ pressed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages in Cuba from the Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization .
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso made almost hundreds of sugar tubes in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish Zu@@ ck@@ erm@@ ac@@ chairs - known , regardless of that there is no significant su@@ cking sugar in the spot .
it is two years ago when activities in the sugar tubes mill were laid .
after the awakening , the sugar tubes industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost to and after its plants , until only the rum@@ or from steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers were forced to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
others signed and comm@@ ute every day to the factories that still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands up every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar tubes industry does not provide his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region sugar tubes are in operation , which after a long in@@ active time , they were in operation because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ as I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tubes industry has already the plagues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the land some decades ago , but the bad harvest could already exist any more .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar tubes industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar tubes were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ usable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar tubes and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 until 2025 , the cost of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; agricultural spec@@ tively &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production level would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the day will go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro visited the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o during his speech on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar tubes were made , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as the soldier , about the closure of the factory speaks , is the word that he repe@@ ats most repeatedly , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all respondents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to maintain the place , they constituted a full time - working group .
before the first escape , the first letters began to come .
it was officially declared documents that only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ i Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any removal .
from then on , the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters came more often .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the set @-@ down factory for two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , which he had in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory , during which it helped to take part .
with each part , which he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producer was wiped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for work sites and services that were generated in the communities in which they were found .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the cost of the population for the closure of the sugar tubes mill
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by grin@@ d .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the referendum of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ as I learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory closed , or even better when they started to take them off , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , and also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , n@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to open .
they were to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not intended for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , to the ruins of the place where he began to work .
ninety @-@ six yields the old soldiers a ship of two thousand p@@ es@@ days a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ as I spend .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and cle@@ arer voice , is not a rebellious person , yet he will tell the lies that man told him .
they have been tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express itself and get their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations @-@ communities in all Canada have dealt with topics that are important for them . they do it by Hi@@ p @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 he has worked directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the ped@@ agog@@ es of David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in northern Que@@ bec , with ten Cre@@ e @-@ hop and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars together .
the workshop will show that the young participants in convers@@ ations , such as &quot; cultural identity , &quot; language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they can find in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations @-@ communities in the British Columbia &apos;s Canadian province , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video game to conve@@ y how important of the receipt of traditional s@@ lei@@ gh and customs , despite the influences by glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters did not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ st@@ i Cre@@ e First nation took up , will be sung in Cre@@ e .
the adolescents received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group , who gave them a drop in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ ebook@@ Twitter page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into English here :
sometimes I feel like that no one would ever be interested in me
but I am trying to go on the earth for my days
that is the day when you take our cry
because we have lost our way to life as a youth
but I believe that we will lift up one day .
I don &apos;t like to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and get prec@@ ede to our youth
so they can do what is determined by the Creator .

in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( from which to do ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , will be shown close to the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( to which , to which , to which , &quot; plac@@ ental models of dishes &quot; ) are served by any food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes , and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a multitude of these small companies that produce these plastic dishes , which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes usually are usually that they don &apos;t even call them all . a new trend , however , is transformed into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic shells decorated cell bands such as they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ ten collective collection , as in this case , cooling cabinet :
here are a few sho@@ cks freezer for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food items will become increasingly elab@@ orate .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , it is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of a growing trip to the county .
some mobile stand and mobile @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon were che@@ ated , any popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetite form , to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of ice cream ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and wrist@@ bands of dried salmon .
for further information r@@ ile plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the Twitter The H@@ ash@@ tag # to , to the level of which is the same .
if you like to know more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi who dedi@@ c@@ ates itself to the manufacturing of the restaurant industry . for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes actually can be established .

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against the drug traffi@@ cking in Mexico , the missing and transmis@@ sions occur regularly in statistics . this , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ on , pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks to those who mourn , or to the commun@@ es who have learned to live with pain .
there are behind any LEICA , behind every bone refund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican News portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co called the &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traffi@@ cking , &quot; ) and stories of people who are talking about the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime lets us not just fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug hands and so many congregations have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how anxi@@ ety lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells about that stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w , just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how every Sunday we prepare for us today to the task that we have set to go and go to the tom@@ bs , according to the people who have loved us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son , Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric store in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
on October 15th he was back again , but he never returned . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but she won &apos;t pay them out because they require a dying .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the ed@@ itors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only need to show the faces of those who fear the fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , break@@ age and the state leadership .
the project is based on readers of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader from Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what form it occurs :
I have now known illness and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m passing through newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with images that can actually come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or made of specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes me from the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one who was anno@@ yed or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be valid or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cousin will think that he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me this is how they were those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who have anxi@@ ety that something has happened to them .
I see our weakness , if stories are to blo@@ t numbers in a stati@@ stic .
the ob@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of man is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were wrong . &quot;
I think they are attemp@@ ting to talk of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring , and still are silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four month Er@@ pres@@ sings in the main district : &quot; as a family with thre@@ ats of thre@@ ats , it describes how armed det@@ ective month for month money from their business , until they were not only destroyed the business , but also had torn her family apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain is never passing away , the sad@@ ness remains , the fear comes back , when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested for the others , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked myself in these terrible days , if weeping would dissolve my frozen feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I must learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence recorded . &quot;
in the introduction , he th@@ rows questions like this : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents themselves take care of them .
Bryan is a fatherless and he tells himself that he had to take himself like a egg , boiled potatoes , tortillas , and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with that .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody bodies of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born in Bryan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 as a violence through the organised crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders on public safety and government Council of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ sec@@ ution numbered 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate them into the soul of the country .
only few stories will continue to live in view of the new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , created the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades , in an intelli@@ gible manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages , to which he ver@@ ts , contain pictures , on which violence is shown .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to lift up a rum@@ or to un@@ lar@@ gement .
but what is the year after something is di@@ pped for the first time ? content in social media , regardless of whether or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to exist further .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago .
since its first publication , it has been used to study trage@@ dies , which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this wrong coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions about our lon@@ ging to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa was negle@@ cted for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous pl@@ ough@@ s full of impact , which were difficult to travel .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker came to the victim .
the deputy representatives described a fire ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinemas in the vicinity , which was full of people who loved the football World Cup .
ruined houses were scattered and fo@@ al bodies scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur User Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day .
the above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body , which are rounded up on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo was in@@ scri@@ bed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but that was not likely to be attributed to the trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am was captured by Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically by atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and sweet .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count the dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were killed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up may be presented .
the occasion for the attack was also reflected , but the army Corps in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here a picture from the DR Congo disappeared again , as proof for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of mal@@ nutrition ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was taken as a proof for mass@@ ages .
even one step further bring personal comments such as this example , the photograph from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image of San@@ ge joined forces with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash of lightning , published by the United Nations , those who could flee bats , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported as the following to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi @-@ Arab news page which was fal@@ sely affected by the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an He said that monks and politi@@ cian had taken part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the DR @-@ Congo picture to illustr@@ ate this information .
the original entry , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations , the AFP mentioned as its source , had also been fal@@ sely affected by this statement , but did not allow the image of the DR Congo in connection .
the world @-@ wide range of false data
traces of these counter@@ orders have to date back to 2011 and 2012 , and actually comes from everywhere around the world .
with the help of an interview , you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
the search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) and 344 pictures , which are very similar to the depicted picture from the DR Congo .
they are from a mixing mask private parties , platforms of social media and community publications and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have been re@@ directed wrong reports , others have tried to un@@ lar@@ v@@ ae the for@@ geri@@ es .
we have used examples for the mis@@ use use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on which side had been published . this way we want to display the range clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of mis@@ use are derived from the listed countries ( some cases also linked to each other ) .
here some cases which can now be split completely ( on the map in orange ) :
card : News frames .
country examples of false copy of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ ated countries point out to pages or servers , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or false reports are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to metad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably due to counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts of Muslims . &quot;

this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the DR are NOT Muslims that kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news page maintained that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein was granted in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the picture of San@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article was updated in 2014 and currently included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the picture was not taken by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar &quot; similar attack . &quot;
when the picture was later in circulation with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to ref@@ ute that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the DR Congo has been di@@ pped with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion under Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 massacre and at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were to be presum@@ ed in the name of Islam , a larger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image was wit@@ ched as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 massacre ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the target was to attract attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , there was a discussion like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to dis@@ appointment .
from the embassy where the DR was included in the DRC , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further examples of a defective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , the Tin@@ Eye will also be back , but are not fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data sets with UR@@ Ls and time / date ) they exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and stores the image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which was first published clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may ultimately possibly be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that pull them through . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in terms of major debates about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second frame uses the image to discuss how an African life is evaluated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer give this pictures .
with social media there are many people who have committed un@@ intended to destroy the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this mood of mis@@ ery and fal@@ low information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the pre@@ valence of violent images have already been deb@@ ated in detail ( e.g. , for example ) .
a argument is that the retention of pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures and viewers are des@@ iring to receive the ability to feel emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , under@@ sought how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the media media , fact it is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
Techn@@ ologists have experiment@@ ing with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to think about the situation in which a picture can be somewhat suggests , which is actually replaced by the context or to completely mis@@ used species .
however , any investigation must be in@@ correct , however , should be considered internationally as they can be internationally .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer language skills to provide a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in every language : they op@@ press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known ( as the famous Portuguese Saudi Arabia ) and others who have been ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist hard @-@ ne@@ ck@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes something is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have already been collected in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and reading is by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the VAT language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Keep you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to get you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; kw@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth which you feel after one gets in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they remove other cultures , un@@ veil other ideas and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite words here .

use D@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour friend and love .
I trust you my four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in fire .
in one minute , we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sk@@ ating we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbrella and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with a towel , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which was built in their performance .
they de@@ fied me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all equal .
we pract@@ ise our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , based on different kind . but somehow we are all connected to the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective conception , that as soon as Muslims , which will not fit there , as I don &apos;t fit there .
de@@ fied dis@@ or@@ ates
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea the religion was deleted by Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the induc@@ tive images of Muslims that have been colonial to Western books for centuries .
this loos@@ ing language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman to save .
in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward Said broke the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures also rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood they continued to continue .
I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , faulty nar@@ rative approaches our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this nar@@ rative exceeded the reality that in the past three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA did not even vote their first female presidential campaign .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women will be forced to bear their head cloth in public buildings and to cover Saudi women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a mighty group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ rative weakened Muslim women to conduct the movements of change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were talked on American floor of Afri@@ cans , who had been brought to slavery with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has under@@ gone our collective pre@@ dest@@ al force and thus fla@@ wed that often si@@ kh men and children are aimed at target an@@ aero@@ bic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ation .
because of these stories we tell and because of the species that we tell them is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but is fear of the other . &quot;
belong to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to have failed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to achieve where seven million Muslims who are at the highest degree &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ employed Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation , coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid their first jewelry design in 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers in New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American astronom@@ ers from Bangladesh by name Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan moved to the world the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents had ab@@ ated Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ affected Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , when people ask me , why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k meat , I say , instead of my Muslim recipes or send my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I scher@@ ze , we do not wear all pocket packages with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists , and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ filled Islamic @-@ fin@@ ery machinery with money , think tanks and experts for folding information which is our already faulty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the nature , in which we tell them , there is Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in more than just a stranger , who plu@@ cked the head cloth .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques over the United States , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in his ug@@ ly forms takes our influ@@ enza .
it takes our identity , which is so far more versatile , versatile , versatile , that it can fit into a drawer .
the author was founded in 1986 on a photo of their nur@@ sery group .
use approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but when I was born to Muslims , when I was four years old when I was four years old in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : believe , behavior and influ@@ enza .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the fire that I am to Muslims when they could look at the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ u@@ rous rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I was silent in my arms and it was called the Arab verses to protect them who are called the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat every one of them three times .
I pray you , that they are protected from evil , the evil one that can see , and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , with their sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the picture of my Grand@@ mother &apos;s matern@@ al relations with her sisters ; as they gain a competition from the art of floral design in Kar@@ achi over the age of decades .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes , that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Holy One ; and one of the Kor@@ an with many members , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that they can almost do .
that Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had said to me , when I have a bad day .
that is how they have taught me , as she hath taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that created more than centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; which has created a company with the &quot; honourable British East of Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep significance to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to people means to grow up and to hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time that my dar@@ ker called a grandfather .
Inter@@ end@@ rin , during which he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan that was ruled by his family in India that he was not allowed to close in its arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinian , their families as with my grandfather , of colon@@ ists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have created all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history was cast out by a Muslim country in a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an in@@ ized , k@@ asch@@ ically subject to the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he was the first mosque in England .
even before he was air@@ planes , he traveled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radi@@ al word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , deep into our unforgettable family trees are back ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over every continent , apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , have gone to Iraq to pursue mass destruction of weapons that are not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
an American Muslims means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times more will be reported as a story with a white attack .
it means that four @-@ ten years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic Emirate of Bil@@ ali Muhammad sunk and brought in this country .
it means that Mal@@ col@@ m X is to name a American hero .

it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .

the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are built on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia consists in the Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and President Obama under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officials who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in action .
it consists in a country that seals its borders on people from just over the countries that are bom@@ bed .
it &apos;s a false and ne@@ bul@@ ky &quot; No @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims .
there are the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we t@@ oss on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t talk , we are here tonight .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientifically described picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 @-@ 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations that we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to be a Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous expres@@ sions we find in our news archive .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say Som@@ e@@ thing von Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ ale Video series Secret lives of Natural , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ om Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , boo@@ sts Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ pers - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences , which go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for the conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists that exist in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House .
they are exposed to exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have Muslims in &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still another group that is exposed to exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , having created the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the history that I was not aware , as I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but I have made me today to an un@@ disputed Muslims .
things I left in my speech here like a bread@@ crum@@ bling lane .
things that may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our humanity make a story where someone is made to one another . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations took place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I count that here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the monkeys of the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago even science of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of this , conscious and un@@ washed the &quot; others &quot; in which we don &apos;t have a new future , in which we had not bom@@ bed the chocolate , while it was already cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; to other people &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative designers wants to preserve urban diversity
dest@@ iny count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way , here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone to enter in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , there is a possible response of stories in its original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ removable blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of large cities and to be worthy .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not forwarded to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we create cities that accept di@@ vers@@ ities - safe spaces , in which residents are not forgotten , who they are to be attributed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often so often to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , to appreciate , to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , D@@ une ob@@ servers make their story first in their own language and translate or explain them to English .
even if the participants are not professional D@@ exter@@ al count , their de@@ vot@@ ion will lead and their presentation means that the listen@@ er will be on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during that round , the D@@ assi@@ dat@@ ors R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou consult the opportunity to explain which to their country &apos;s typical customs of nar@@ rative .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ w of the bun@@ ny and the god@@ father in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having explained the importance of its Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to a audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide ridge , he shares his feeling of in@@ forms :
they have heard !
they were att@@ entive to ...
they were very with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS in order to organize their own skills .
Puerto Rico calls from the United States to re @-@ establish the State School
with the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place in 72 million US dollars on April 3 , 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ane Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da , &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural testing of the debt ) and the ec@@ top@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ acy of the debt of debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os requires that politicians , b@@ arians and government authorities , who are responsible for debts , are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions of appropriate compensation , which is in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay debts , which is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not take off with decreasing retirement payments .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not in the territory of the territory of the US - suff@@ ers from a serious financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside are without participation in the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration bore the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions that he performed for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture that is held in Berlin annually , devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ ri@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who manufactures in France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read out excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ qu@@ ion ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , published in the last year and is licensed here , contains a number of paragraphs that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of freedom of knowledge , have worked on site to look beyond the fog , which gives our news@@ fe@@ eds to create something out of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title College memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to push for his release and want to know it back in his normal life and freedom .
as Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us let us begin to reflect on their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds , and decisions .
why are we here tonight ?
what did we decide for what ?
what did we do in this process of times by extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the Web@@ developer of Open Source and Digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention centre of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was made up of the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility , transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly ge@@ heim &quot; marked by the military tribunal in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who had submitted themselves to himself as the In@@ sider of the Assad government , and they were aware of any alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and condition remains unknown , but remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in order to expand access to the internet and to the knowledge of public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical psych@@ ologist and currently super@@ charged the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps one of Bas@@ ement cultural prototypes have been predi@@ ctive as the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the annex@@ ation of many civ@@ ili@@ zations and merge into Greek Roman @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ c traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would set everything about it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike train into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be used to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
Bas@@ sel could not complete this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and b@@ loss@@ y taught me to embra@@ ce them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English when he was already in detention .
I learned to read English well , to write and speak English .
he always has his knowledge of shared with everyone who has asked . he taught other in@@ mates , to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my gate to the technology . he taught me both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other in@@ mates , as they use computers , at least theoreti@@ cally , without the fact that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi &apos;s author is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a prostitute , which she wrote in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
they viol@@ ate the texts to him when they visited him , and he translated them out of the Arab to English .
the book is free available .
book@@ case by Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening . &quot;
it is happening at every visit ,
that I sin@@ cer@@ ned in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in that moment , in which we embra@@ ce us ,
that any of the haz@@ ards are not matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , chains and watch@@ men
I forget the scr@@ ut@@ iny of the prison
and I go in every detail of your voice and words .
which I bear with my passion ,
if your eyes will say farewell
and I invite another piece of my soul with you ...
I turned back quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring to all the moments ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I bear witness myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ ha@@ zi wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel :

Bas@@ le History is not unique in Syria .
according to the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ets since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or were executed by violence through the regime , were tor@@ tured or executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International , since 2011 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians died in detention .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : sentenced to previous post due to corruption ;
Muslim re@@ acted to a corruption of corruption in which a government member , after half of his sentence , returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , in which corruption was committed .
it is a Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants because of contamination of 54 million Me@@ ad@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money was made of public money from Mozambique , which he ruled by Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released in 2016 because of good guidance and asked immediately his re@@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which claims for the application , there wouldn &apos;t be an obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a in order to obtain his old post as the company was not a disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants are not called the action .
the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution which sets itself for public transparency , den@@ ounced in an interview with the German Wave , the decision of the company to re@@ introduce the director :
puts a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and even a step in relation to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we are aware that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the contra@@ dict@@ ations .
however , the company was silent , however , and causes no adequate legal steps to use the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well as viewed as &quot; contradi@@ cted &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to imprisonment and half of them .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating Spe@@ eches , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has entered into the company to be re@@ integrated into the firm , which he helped damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is gladly paid for his silence .
resist@@ ors !
bit@@ one Vi@@ days , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ence and student of political science in Brazil , says the director no Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is rewarded from the state because he ins@@ ult him , I can not believe that one has rewarded someone in such a way that has already offended the State .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a l@@ acks the mor@@ als to return and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , only the state has served .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the state , as a hand@@ ler to become an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was then convicted and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ k , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a thief was in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ ambi@@ kan@@ ers will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , cutting , and - as a prophecy , prophe@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous depic@@ tions was , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of being able to sell their own individual interest , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not the case . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn away from its amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is discri@@ min@@ ated at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also taught :

Facebook has blocked the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ ri@@ erb@@ se or sp@@ it b@@ age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known soci@@ etal network accepted their posts from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
though more than the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or to that of which , ( in bur@@ mes@@ ischer script ) as a part of an initiative to tackle the widely adopted problem of Hass@@ language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely ab@@ rupt con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as a Hass@@ ence against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to combat the Hass@@ ary in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaning@@ ful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word to itself is not calling automatically Hass@@ ary .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts or for the purpose of their use , were cen@@ sored .
Moreover , there are several bur@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ line age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ se@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in spirit @-@ rich way , whether they could learn how he could relie@@ ve his back pain , having made a word @-@ game .
the proposition ku la - &quot; C@@ ure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the r@@ assi@@ stic expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ res is the opinion that they may reduce the language of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook has to be analytical to spread all the polic@@ emen that occurred in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the Autom@@ atic will not understand what you write to facets .
what it should do instead , is carefully analyse the post and control it by check the words below .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ar b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that this three nation@@ alists will spread the Hass@@ language , a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to protect its nation@@ alism .
while the action is to send a strong signal to everyone to spread the Hass@@ language , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of key@@ words are often a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , with the users of social networks just start to use a new word or an alternative write of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate described how Facebook started to delete its Po@@ sts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I att@@ entive to this new Directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post of Facebook was removed and me the li@@ ken , post and parts of content has been interrupted for 24 hours because the post office does not un@@ lock the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts from people who have no negative int@@ entions , or simply try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ i of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ i :
post without Hass@@ ence from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations are badly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask counsel :
Facebook likes to have a beneficial intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but this does not work .
with such words , only more hatred will be presented within the different communities .
it seems , as if they have begun to have begun without local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; .
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not try to report the fal@@ si@@ bly dissolved podium .
if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks automated c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has been saved for a lot of users among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are using Facebook fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their polic@@ emen are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook panel that ab@@ stain@@ ed no Hass@@ ary , but nevertheless they were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry and look at a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook is the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

the post : &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screenshot used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious foundations , social networks have used to expand their votes and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ i should also heat the violence in the communities in Burma , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to speak the wu@@ di@@ ly Hass@@ eries on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of just reading the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos;s , it would have had been better that more on context than on Code of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end of the children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on June 9 , 2017 , the country &apos;s Parliament approved unanimously a law which is to offer this practice , so that the marriage is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the sp@@ ouse , some members of the Central and Muslim religious groups held in practice , and in May 2016 brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group that gathered representatives from the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state does not have the maturity . &quot;
this was un@@ noticed by the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights Convention , the min@@ ors as defined , every human being under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Ministry of Central Office confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media moves that endeav@@ our@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws at children &apos;s to@@ e , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they don &apos;t hesitate to bring this result .
nevertheless , everything went very smooth .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no concerns among the critics of the children &apos;s before , they were dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this type of religious opposition was in@@ complicated for st@@ resses in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and some doubts were doubt if the opposition would agree to the law .
however , in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s to@@ e - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent that contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook an status update , which has once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of Bill was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided on it .
after being decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users was enthusiastic , because the laws have been finally changed to children before finally .
member of Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial department in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary words needed to wear the core of the matter , but you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is worth every price .
while Abel was Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ happy that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ tex News !
the married law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who hears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that is quite open to it , said :
the age @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independent of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft of the sp@@ ouses was adopted today , June 9 , 2017 .
the House of Represent@@ atives has 41 dep@@ uties and 35 of them were present at the voting .
all the dep@@ uties , who were opposed to law , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s to@@ e is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # 5 mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ ild@@ a .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ iled him .
con@@ gr@@ ats congratulations .
a peace to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country .
2 months ago , Mahar@@ aj told his intention to undertake a judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pen@@ ess of the law , thought that Mahar@@ aj would like to do against the law , most social media users would like to do the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear satellite when we , instead of keeping the discussion as generally speaking , in a way that we would like to talk to the state into our bedroom , that it may be possible to dis@@ mis@@ use our daughters that they might be mis@@ used in the advantage , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a court case against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal to legal or continue the standard , even though there are laws that they teach them .

for more than a month , Turkey has been the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day by day is clear how important the platform for users is to help helpful and share reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and repor@@ ter and fans of TV series blows themselves against the lock@@ out .
although many techniques were used to block instruction tools for block web pages ( a current article published by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has shut down articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , you will find regular block@@ zations of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second largest country in the world , when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be closed , several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia are reflected and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform created all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not make it difficult on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite the legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese Wild@@ ch@@ fot@@ ogra@@ f uses his camera to att@@ entive to the need for natural protection .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked round about , never satisfied . they were awake with po@@ ison@@ ous moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
we motiv@@ ate him to wear a camera with himself and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ une animal world endeav@@ oured to bring to the international stage .
and its home right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nep@@ als animal world .
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild animal photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ ather Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to gn@@ ash images ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to obtain an cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ als Nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious , as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood before him face to face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b from the opinion of sheep not in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
I was also due to the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the he@@ avi@@ est appeared . he immediately sets off , we look forward and star@@ red me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly stayed in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ ter &apos;s National Park recordings . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist arrivals .
see below some of these photos .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years after the wedding , there were Indian women for the first time to send out the name of their husbands &quot; &quot; &quot;
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was posted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally released to video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention here .
in many parts of India there must be women with greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even by older men in the family .
instead , they use a p@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ atri@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ a@@ stra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women that they must respect the husband because of social pressure as well as the fear of the consequences , they should be violated the standard , this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state O@@ bes@@ a by a court court and cast off by her family and the village of the village , after she had talked with names .
the tradition of their wives did not call on the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less legitim@@ ate instructions to fear if at all , they should not come after this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals , as well as domestic women , a unique club , were therefore quickly become the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they discuss the details of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss it .
when one of 56 clubs which exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and reli@@ es on the dismant@@ ling of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ p has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s council up to the exp@@ iry of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides those clubs .
it reports how this clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made at the same time as ambassador of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion group , acted by women who didn &apos;t call their husbands in their name .
she decided on this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify the women .
not according to the names of their husbands , is a brilli@@ ance that they all have to be found guilty and never turned into question .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition bears that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t like this is considered to be a c@@ un@@ ning , as a woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made us up to this discussion round thought .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband so far in his name , try to try out how it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion lap of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained for a long time after the video was at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him down by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ ini .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to step discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they should not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands above the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ oth in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ ath of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women to the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so sh@@ y that , during the whole exercise , it was just before moving and another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family , by allowing it to curse him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in addition to the ad@@ ren@@ al fr@@ enz@@ y , in addition to having an ancient brilli@@ ance , the women decided that they were actually trying to name their husbands in their behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she sat in his head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
when her mother in law en@@ vi@@ ed her , she was afraid , and told that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in attendance was less under@@ stand@@ alone and the situation existed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ouse :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to wear it .
the other women didn &apos;t have stopped completely , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are doing a trip with any discussion group .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like to make sure that women make sure what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and spoke about things about which they had never made thoughts before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems since so many years and yet I also have about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are tied to our husbands , never so honest .
it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes .
some women in the group have only been carried by Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a tro@@ users , they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of war and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes @-@ election , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ gling Roh@@ ini their own pair of cur@@ t@@ as ( upper hem@@ at@@ y ) into a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can bear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion group has changed slightly , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into the roles :
we have made only small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they listened to saying the name of their husband .
some of them , including me , do not make it , but only if they are alone , and no other family members are here .
only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands , only one or two wives now bear at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion group know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives , like the fe@@ eds of more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman goes in the club home and other people reported that we are talking about what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ trading , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , be@@ holding the police from Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to life in order to stop practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims were be@@ headed , and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently stood in the succession that the organs of Sch@@ am@@ anas in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
there may be the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a gl@@ ar man could bring gold in old or wealth , the polic@@ eman of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ aring men were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the purpose of assassin@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and to combat precau@@ tions .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le males who travel to Mozambique for mos@@ ambi@@ k are target rit@@ u@@ eller attacks , warned the Mozambique police after the latest kill@@ ings of three strong men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ urban in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already after the case :
PR@@ M believes that the am@@ ai@@ anas are involved in the death of gl@@ ar heads @-@ strong men .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ ass@@ ettes individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ot@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been given by the traditional Sch@@ am@@ anen &apos;s Office , which also gives the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also suggests that a faith exists , according to the victims in the head of power , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ g@@ ator arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , the fact that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty that Mozambique is facing :
I would like to invite E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ IN@@ I am ashamed of the recordings of a Por@@ no@@ film , where the teacher would be ashamed to earn sex against good notes , work and other achievements to deser@@ ve their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os or bin@@ aries of super@@ st@@ itious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;

we are deeply affected , from the death of our friend Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il .
we mourn for him , and speak our deep emp@@ i@@ rical con@@ dol@@ ences against his family , his friends and all those who knew him and have loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in it to extend the public to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in the Arab Blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by people who became himself as the In@@ sider of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband was condemned to death , but they gave no further information .
Bas@@ le Stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials , that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in future we prove all the monkeys of Bas@@ sel as a pioneer of the Open Web Movement .
and we honor the efforts of all the persons and organisations that have been used for his release in the past five years .
since 2011 and the start of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people , so the Organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those who were arrested by the regime were arrested or violent , they are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians came in custody to death , such as the international human rights organisation Amnesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ ces Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) Nine reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and President Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has held attention in the international community , after his attor@@ ney had announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of state ) , having responded to the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel prize @-@ winning and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing it to allow for a treatment abroad .
while several countries have criti@@ ci@@ zed the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others have completely covered the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
drawing R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Li@@ u to get a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to release questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway came into the stores , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government admitted that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to re @-@ exp@@ ire to China , because exports since 2010 were mostly blocked .
after the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision where China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as described in a statement on 30 June :
we look at the same time that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet all visits and receive , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; US ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would like to him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad so that it would be helpful to him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary @-@ Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AFP to release the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the announcement of the US Embassy moved out a ra@@ ging response from China to itself , with the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to invite themselves to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley divided that China should offer the couple of following :
protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to the medical care of his choice , based on them according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international commitments .
the US Senate Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz , also introduced a decision in the Congress to release the Chinese government on it , release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I challenge China to release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally allowing it to go to a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing was Reuters , China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could be over@@ thrown by Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on to provide an appropriate medical care for providing an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told him that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to speak with someone outside , including his attor@@ neys .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you further :
Canada calls for China to address its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and those who are subject to the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested China in an explanation on 29 June , free of charge for humanitarian reasons :
all the necessary actions need to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he needs , ir@@ respective of where , and in addition , his wife and his family can contact him .
although the news broadcast@@ er France Info has already reported that the French government had welcomed Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of State announced that there is no further information , if France would eventually absorb it .
Taiwan
the Council of Fest@@ iting matters in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and make a greater tolerance towards those that ask peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Party of Democratic Party demanded China too , allowing the sick intellectual Li@@ u to leave himself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself greatly wor@@ ried in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives , which he took , and for which he had been strictly pen@@ alised , had contributed to a harmon@@ ious , stable and wealthy families , which would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I personally felt very moved and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and legal state in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may be stup@@ id when Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark took a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting during a meeting of the international bi@@ gs of the State Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he under@@ line that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , with most people commit a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to spin the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable land , we say that we were not to be a country .
it was so vul@@ gar , it had a flight to escape before the responsibilities , an obligation to breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what , he appeared in@@ sof@@ ar .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as you reach the main point of the Th@@ as , the good old Lei@@ er came down from the author@@ itarian bri@@ ers to be the stated Democrats , leaving the failure , because it fits better to their power .
in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , answers had been given to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ c@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers rational type .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion , since they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to what country belongs to our city ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very than@@ k@@ ful if our advertising K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take up the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was paid high , to be part of the government of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog on the blog , it shows that it was to be able to read the full script of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; town &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ important , even if we are pleased to enjoy free and righteous elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he insi@@ sted Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t recognize it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the leader of a growing generation , such as pol@@ em@@ ic testimony .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very close ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which awaits me - be I agreed with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , really associated with what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review sets the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam has committed an error , or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ger spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country will go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government officials , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam is of serious importance .
why do the military service work its military service , but they do not defend its city but not their country ?
who must withdraw our Prime Minister In@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink personnel identity ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
ten@@ se , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for affir@@ mation , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have received many of the most part ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked some of his ed@@ itors : what is the most miss@@ able aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is applied to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ever since the conversation takes place the conversation , it is regarded as pol@@ ite to show interest in his talk partner by presenting personal issues .
in my clari@@ fication then the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; a lot of Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook inside with anger , if they are kept for Americans , but me doesn &apos;t distur@@ b me .
for someone who does not know himself , there are little that differs from Americans by Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag at their back@@ pack when travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
American , however ... .
so it was , when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small A@@ hor@@ n@@ leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender equality in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we are manifest very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies as the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we are nice .
I hate this .
first of all , I have many American friends that I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would not make me anything , if you would change Johnny from Dallas , for example .
by Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or by Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all : as &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to , is basically to be sp@@ icy - as the poor , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double @-@ stream ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people such as N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing at which you can stum@@ ble .
to be harm@@ less , is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that happen around one around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire is to be free and only to be the main character of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence across the fence .
we l@@ acks a warm heart , open kindness , who meanwhile connected to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au turned the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada like sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop band has published a music video showing the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zed , which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government in 2014 , continues to revi@@ ve the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video does not refer to the ongoing military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band has been invited by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was divided up to 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists to view the public , viewing this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to the Thai policy , in@@ special as it remains in the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video which relate to some of the political themes , in Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which constitutes the commander of the captain of the host of absolute national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11 rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to the &quot; setting of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the Act on computer criminal , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear provisions are often used by the authorities to de@@ file activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unity was set up in the army , supervised by the online content and people who are accused of having de@@ fam@@ ed the monarchy .
Thailand reli@@ es a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty of the Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war broke out in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts war@@ n that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax exemp@@ ts .
in the video it is shown even how people are thrown into a black supply car before reaching them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and use Internet users to ins@@ ure the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs of the band showed the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Asia .

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , first published on the website of OC Media , published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company re@@ covers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has passed over 20 years now , since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , amor@@ tization , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians and Ab@@ ni@@ es live in the area .
these settlements are also called violin cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these vul@@ tures .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district of 16.000 people had barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ ak@@ k@@ ow@@ kas , is a symbolic for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are broken and very rarely are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it will be hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do I talk ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were parish centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community .
now there are only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or @-@ buildings .
people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile deserted the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ov@@ kas , which can host one or two families , one recognizes the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they dis@@ covering me with the camera in your hand , they go back immediately .
&quot; our Mother has prohibited us that we can photograph it , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her friend something and suddenly , they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ence economy ( cultivation of land products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping , and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come about the rounds .
in the winter , the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
about ten years ago an older wife moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is mentioned in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jung@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her eldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not live in front of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells it .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she gives her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ osp@@ els tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holiday is , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; she cri@@ es to her . &quot; they said , &quot; We could build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as discus@@ sion@@ ed designer Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembers the town before the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought Land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but that will last something , &quot; explains it .
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage b@@ room .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as &apos;s kinder@@ garten once housed , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ ubs and chickens .
she tells that there was a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her chan@@ gels .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear in front of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it was more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any job , and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation draws to the end , a little boy is gone by us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball is flying from the window and another boy after him .
he plays with the ball , who then roll the hill .
now a group of children pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them cast stones to the ruined buildings .
these ruins are a part of her childhood , which provide for in@@ trin@@ ity in her life .
they don &apos;t know it different .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and will be published here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants attemp@@ ting Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very easy hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink base frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name of M@@ um Africa .
this nick@@ name is weakened by the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) became a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ an who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars per night , guests can sleep in simple rooms , grinding , round , walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ cultural immigrants come here .
sometimes , his wife told Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to a full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the time it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside of cart@@ ons .
she would like to refuse to refuse .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gurt ) po@@ unded to Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women .
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , hopes to get to Boston to get there her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some African people who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then go toward the north .
the family had heard of other trails of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his pioneers has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest since months ago in M@@ om Africa : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he got in contact with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never let it go again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that their guests are often sending text message when they go , to gr@@ it them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have contributed to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valencia .
in this winter , Valen@@ ci@@ ela and his family included migrants in their small house .
it is Po@@ lic@@ it and has established that Bust@@ ers will be sold to numerous afri@@ can migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ an .
some sleeping on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ ci@@ ela declared that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was named after a raid on his work from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to save money from him without a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an Un@@ known , an All@@ ende , has offered him roof .
a few months later , the family lives still there and tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears , the trav@@ ellers rely on their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a small bus arrived today and has 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic because of those who went away .
she laugh@@ s like a proud grand@@ mother in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s , who gave her a sp@@ ine , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she briefly presented her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have been continued . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
please send a check @-@ point for personal communication tools in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang of Twitter users to the level of countries .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in the west of China , are forced to install a Spyware to their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users received a mobile notification in Tian@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , in which it shows the District government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities are able to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app , had replaced messages with a private poker chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app wants to determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ asing pages to make users att@@ entive to you how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; Remote controlled &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker might be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to steal .
this introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities arrange often extreme c@@ ens@@ ers and monitoring measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely internet @-@ off .
based on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( to which , in accordance with this effect , published photos by a check@@ point , on the polic@@ emen the inhabitants had already checked , they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian represent sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity due to public growth technology .
we are back again in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( which is to that which is in comparison ) , published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements for a Windows operating system and therefore un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang on electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council that minim@@ ize distribution of illegal contents .
all government officials , authorities and the party , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication tools .
a current report by Freedom House , an US @-@ American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , an ordinance for all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable disks , not@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police station .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . this promotion does not viol@@ ate the privacy rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you see yourself and imagine that you &apos;re all alone at one place , in which all things have disappeared .
everything has dissolved itself after and after it was dissolved and a truth reveals that clearly recogni@@ z@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one who has dis@@ ma@@ stered in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions that don &apos;t allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get the reality again and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and performer - transform the characters into being made of meat and blood , and all cri@@ es according to death .
all a doubt solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is going on the axis of the infin@@ ity . it is clear that you are caught between the walls and your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this didn &apos;t attain to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put his power over us , having even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful prot@@ on such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to break the city &apos;s darkness at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ende &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts of the town , not only my own .
for the first time it was still , reg@@ ression , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that remains to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their comp@@ lications .
during the third night the things were calm after the power supply had heard in the district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , while I cried several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ende &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt very good enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we allied to a beautiful picture that filled my expectations and fulfilled all .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are liberated the spirit from the lamp , but it simply isn &apos;t interested in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet us at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return your voice , after you have gotten it all the way up to the office of Security Service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me hear , as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu file &apos; , or you are only bold enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ash filled eyes were upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to look on what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood at this building .
perhaps it was about my folly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure that I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regre@@ t the word that I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in single and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot;
the st@@ ank of this curse set lies me up to now in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to months for months .
I out@@ cry the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I will bear with me .
thereafter again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through one ais@@ le to the single cells .
I know all the details exactly , before I ate the room .
otherwise , they probably received a larger cell in me this time .
I need to share it with just one more det@@ ain@@ ees and may immediately place me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I access to a well @-@ approved communication method : to beat the wall against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my horn player was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time he answered me finally .
apparently , in any of the surrounding cells , there was a well @-@ respected man @-@ middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive fac@@ tions can be seen , and there are no doctors here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe somebody , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers have an existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him when I stay .
li@@ ar .
we would like to have had an evil way to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which are lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ende &quot; bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ mp@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I always was convinced that black the colour of per@@ dition is , till I saw the yellow light , which gave us the grass in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ unders &quot; , An@@ no@@ bility to the 13th s@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
thus the secret was ventil@@ ated : to protect the state of state before us and to prevent the terror@@ ists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ tical dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ ical map and ri@@ pped the narrow view@@ point of its world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is here no country , it is a curse to call them Ko@@ exist@@ ential to transform the crimin@@ als into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I supervised the hearing and meet in Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the face of the face , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my kids , you are still young , you can join this day with your life when you join this day and to protest that you will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t answer .
I acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly what ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly discussion for me have become an ordinary communication .
when and how did it happen , it was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to be punished or ill to be punished , even though I had done nothing to earn these punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ aca .
your Hen@@ ker remembers your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you cannot withdraw your shame .
my sh@@ re@@ ie failed to him not enough , making it out the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage collectors or whether it was part of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables in@@ flo@@ ated to present us from their point of view , great invention of a giant cab@@ els .
within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , why I stopped to sh@@ out .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling and found no pleasure in it , so he put the next to an electrically charged rod .
power through my whole body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ neck body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power manager .
the dew disappeared and the pain was again there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep on me again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , ar@@ ro@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering with the voice of a exhau@@ sti@@ ve youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make terri@@ bly concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent , and walk away , you shall be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ e Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smoke a cigarette in his studio .
this photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings the majority of its time inside ; sometimes , he sn@@ apped up to his screen , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
what you can leave , however , is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ in@@ treated lips to discover .
he lives on the top floor of his family house that has since been heard in 1967 ; the year where Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and the family of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where she lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ ib has been a passi@@ on@@ ful activ@@ ist who oppos@@ e the conservative majority and pos@@ thum@@ ously their alt@@ re@@ proven opinions about gender rollers , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ ing .
with his music , which deals often with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian cultures , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all of these issues do not only find in its home town of Amman , but also in cities that followed from Damascus in Syria until all San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ ib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking , and he can suffer from his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he is not open to the US foreign policy , he li@@ ft@@ eth a special dis@@ closure against the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib viewed his art in Amman in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib believe not that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , anything that was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian who was born in Jordan even though he was born in Jordan and never before had never been in Palestine .
&quot; I do not think of my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think that &quot; as I am a man , &quot; while living in water dissolved nest café in two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is foreseen for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
apparently H@@ da@@ ib had a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot junk@@ ed day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the che@@ ek speak of a warm coffee and the v@@ aim of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose to the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you throw a look into the neighboring countries .
from hence , it simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ anian had cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
some par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians support the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ing that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the country is opposed to the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ uties and former Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher@@ in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vism , which provides the approved legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sil@@ et@@ ori@@ ze , but in fact a clear reality reflected in the crystalline reality reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work is clear .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib established traditional gender nor@@ ms by moving his vision from the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of obviously in@@ tox@@ ated unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ or &apos; of &apos; Hon@@ or &apos; - the in@@ un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch : according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan is still missing that Jordan has become an institutional infrastructure to support women , victims attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for bre@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation from 1954 , women who are exposed to risk of family violence , &quot; and for her release is often required for a long @-@ term bureau@@ cratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman is nothing to happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music is very popular and is well @-@ known for it , not to rec@@ ite the topics that are long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ ib denied that his work is political , however , is a fact that he can not separate his music , full of un@@ licensed approaches to sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion of freedom .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
politics was in@@ scri@@ bed to me , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically involved in the nucle@@ us can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - whether faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and reading , and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ programme Ro@@ ya to be sure that his comments were torn out of the context , and in his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a modified version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ da@@ ib advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance against homosexu@@ ality does not apply to Islam .
it mentions Abu Nu@@ clear , a poet of the eighth century , which still remains in memory thanks to its hom@@ o@@ er@@ otic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ clear , who should work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could be open to homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why is it not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Le@@ ila , or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing new anymore that the government ch@@ ests attacks on the free expression and that progressive votes will be transferred to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service ordered several ex @-@ government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the grounds that they had criti@@ ci@@ ously criti@@ cally critic@@ ised the problems in social media , linked to corruption in the country .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to counter@@ act a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
for him , progress is an independent and take @-@ off . Jordan has held a show for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , reasoned and in@@ humane changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ ib died , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dreams for his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region will be informed by means of music , art and literature of a real and basic off@@ ence - and not through bombs , stre@@ et@@ un@@ itions and on artificial art . at least he hopes it .
as far as far as it is , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to continue and also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant warri@@ ors are as fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories with regard to the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the forces , the drums and dancing more than one thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great places , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al .
I &apos;ve been looking forward to Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two cars are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only feeling - and in this way , to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter high car was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were external appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and encourage a legitim@@ ate profession as the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ b and illegal drugs are everyday .
a pol@@ l published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore the fallen hair@@ dres@@ sers of famous sports artists such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ hair@@ dres@@ sers who can form these hair@@ dres@@ sers .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ dres@@ sers who go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity has even an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts come to each other in order to show that one can create the most ex@@ centric Loo@@ ks , as can be seen in the following video ( additional videos to current competitions there are at the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people against hair@@ style tools and instead of bad advice to obtain a training in hair@@ style art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March , and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love with the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ amb@@ itions to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people that we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel stretched out , aff@@ ection aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ c@@ ili@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ c@@ iliation ) , and to write young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colom@@ bian ) , which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
at the same time the sign@@ posted to peace treaty was so significant that President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its in the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , before the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and carried out their weapons with their weapons , to integrate them back into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which was acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , now you have to record them into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian has to close together and would have to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did , until now , thousands of young people already wrote letters - love letters to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - which are to be delivered personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was held at the World Summit of Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ um@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we love the people who love Him , Valentine &apos;s Day of thousands of love letters , but those who need to make them much more constra@@ ined .
he plane , he continued reading this year to share his love with people who needed the most urgent effects .
thus , the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which now need to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I would never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were transferred to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March in one of the UN camps .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to personally over@@ take the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves on how they used it earlier to meet the orders of their leaders .
but this time they have not received orders , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings may pass through in just a few hours - from anxi@@ ety to luck and everything that is in between &quot; says the policy scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience so :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ code &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go into , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the bush .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone has written me something like a nice , so do I answer it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I completely embra@@ ced him and put me beside the pomegran@@ ates .
maybe he was sorry for war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life to war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep it and his six brothers before the star@@ vation . &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society that is waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have just learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
starting the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all growing up as already war and the F@@ ARC already had already been in secret .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and made insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop us to develop a political party , we can help us to develop the society in this country .
for a target of this size order , it &apos;s worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people , who had never found their hearing and had no election right , and to recognize that the people who have often had seen monsters , and even people who have turned their environment through their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me hurt .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed , and have caused much harm to give us a smile and a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian has been made , that it would rule peace according to the dis@@ arm@@ ament of peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest against their rights . and that &apos;s also quite justified ( ... ) .
we now rely on the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion , or ide@@ ology of them belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but we will overcome them together .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the per@@ secu@@ tions in Che@@ chn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article which was written by uns@@ rem partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and its first publication on the website OC Media .
Hom@@ osexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - such as discrimination , physical and sexual violence and stress .
with fear of terror , the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat , which hung up as a women &apos;s value over the dor@@ m L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only done overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ y who has dealt with us some of their experiences with us and with us about what is currently in the Republic .
the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines prior to several months after the reports were published , the s@@ lugg@@ ish , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ y Gaz@@ eta , and threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who susp@@ ects que@@ ens men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a nurse , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
from childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was growing , it became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so that she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chens from the gene@@ alo@@ gies of their Land@@ s@@ woman , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ pers at a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who stuck in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend of my documents , and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chn@@ ya friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men any more in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ app go round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was just going to bring some shopping st@@ akes from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a mas@@ cot saying : &quot; here is a gift for you of your uncle . &quot;
when I turned myself , I felt somewhat in my body , but I did not hurt me .
then I listened to a set , but this time in Che@@ chn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you like the family still , you cry ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last du@@ des in the hospital .
apparently some women got together and started to sh@@ out .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had taken two samples in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since then my male name stands on ; but the doctor stood and put me to the women .
for that I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it to do with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am than@@ k@@ ful to him that he is still respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they called me , and wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the desired to send me to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they presented absur@@ d demands : some said to me , I must prove it , by breaking up without the streets ; others wanted to stop that I had not changed my sex in the official television station in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and I had not changed my sex , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how does your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic has been damaged .
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much , and she put a stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to a flat and already a few hours later there was a car with dar@@ kened window discs and a number plate with a number of 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the number@@ ing of the number@@ ing - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I want to remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unexpected .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my m@@ om once I arrived .
I bought her without a record , without identification , without any identification .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you believe not about , you warmer in security , only because you have left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you are using . they even know your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not speak about the sexually ass@@ ump@@ tions , this is a table of tobacco .
I still bear some of the Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
so very much I wish it , this spiritual barrier may not be overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really give myself trouble as the person remember@@ ing it from their past - so remember my male shape .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what to do your friends , those who have stayed with ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for whom I took more information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who has left one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they are now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to do so , they probably re@@ charge the relatives , these care about the problem with the affected person and in the end ask proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; through blood gen@@ ius has experienced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are now even pregnant women recorded in these insi@@ sts ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine , there wouldn &apos;t be many .
and when , above all those who have no rich relatives or those who have dropped from their relatives , were able to set up cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there , so that you can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : if they were killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they would have attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but di@@ pped specifically to radi@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is that only a failure , or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I quote someone who had been detained in Ar@@ gun a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was , when these people were taken .
however , they were not presented as a band , but there were no reports until now . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why would you not have allowed it to shave this man ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and performances of people who have a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation belong already in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I believe already before 2003 I was already known as Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civ@@ ilization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately prevented us back in the stone days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted ; I had coloured lashes , wore Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the security of the Sh@@ aria law has never used to me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been offended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ mp@@ se : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when most of them are fun .
OC Media : so did they just shut up their eyes before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offended me , never ch@@ ased and never beaten me .
OC Media : how long did this grace time kept ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk on television via Mor@@ al .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like the people of the city began to change .
who had ra@@ ged before , and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity is going to go right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t deser@@ ve much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
I &apos;m still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gathering , I start to get them to the hospital and help them to get t@@ ens@@ ing cards .
I lost no cents for this .
I have discovered these people themselves , when I feel refuge .
I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear any Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ ed@@ itors .
so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens which prophes@@ ies with foam in front of the mouth that there is no threshold .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er have who , the Russians have also what ; on the planet it gives them - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear something .
I meet here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ cing Muslims who go into the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ations of men , the men love , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce .
these are two different things - two different types of sens@@ ations to be exact , different habit@@ ats .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and will not be ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I am personally born here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of suicide within the ar@@ ming Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months , there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ ing .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on the 27th of August , the des@@ per@@ ated situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxi@@ ety , depression and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come up for his family , such as Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to stay in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
one on YouTube divided video , the moments after he had set himself on YouTube , was fixed .
some people managed to er@@ ase the flames back , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that doctors could not do any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that was ex@@ ited in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists in front of that even more men could take their lives .
Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - ham@@ id manipul@@ ate , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ am Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have a thing in common : all family fathers , who were forced to work on the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and unable to work their families and to work for a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which most of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to den@@ ounce its living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and in 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran ahead of oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable useful areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continued to grow slowly , and the indigenous population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often victim of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Ara@@ bians in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and gh@@ om are surrounded .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region of drought , and local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab disease w@@ zi @-@ adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operating , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who is looking for a job , finished in primary school , 55 % completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and r@@ assistant eth@@ ical discrimination , leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ mor@@ ing among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse than it has been worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic origin and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
as officials and institutions do not prefer the Arab work force , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will ent@@ ail access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab and to force her living being outside of their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their consent to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and so @-@ called Arab names on the workplace are not toler@@ ated , sof@@ ten as the speaking of Arabic language or the tragedy of Arabic clothes .
given the given circumstances , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi need to beat human rights activists , before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treated and committed suicide .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I identified not with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ se@@ ctional &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the review that was posted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fr@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women react , especially white women , who describe themselves as inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they are surprised , why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even do well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women in spite of the same education still earn less money than men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women earlier , or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination on the sex are still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of it , and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I arrive on the skin colour , on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention , on which type we have physically and banned both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , many of the white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ists have to be silent .
however , however , all agree that women - all women - to come together in order to raise &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institutional form of assi@@ mil@@ ated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times .
or about the fact that black women and women , and women , and women , make less deser@@ ved than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often the school are referred to as white girls , because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ h@@ men and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all human rights have any skin colour of the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join the black woman as a black woman who ref@@ uses to take into account the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , which relate to both the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and I won &apos;t fight any more my consent in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that always denied me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ain in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also ref@@ uses to justify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised beings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I sof@@ ar me to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs of customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to get the importance of white women &apos;s importance of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honour one of the better .
although the inter@@ se@@ ctional Femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different interests and to abol@@ ish themselves from white Femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to join me full of femin@@ ism and join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that interpre@@ ter is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define the black women on our own ideas and join us into the spher@@ es that are created for us .
Cl@@ enormous a Hudson line , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ in@@ ism . ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) speaks of what we can defend ourselves , in which they are fully safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped .
although some white and inter@@ se@@ ctional femin@@ ists instantly call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they read these lines , please tell you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women other cultures , because I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment in which my life is neither translated , nor ignored , nor rejected .
pad@@ dle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article is re@@ published here in part of an Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Agreement .
in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan Region of Iraq . its mission aims to deliber@@ ate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river , which we lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust explosion , pollution and controlled development , lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of Water@@ pp Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who has reli@@ ed and works in order to protect the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the vibration and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced and filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key , a documentary filmmaker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , in Er@@ bil , Iraq , in Er@@ bil .
the main emphasis of their work is based on a few despised sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ and video photography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques that can tell their help in their own way .
Paraguay Women and her difficult struggle against violence
a group of women , &quot; The crying women , &quot; in order to express their pain on the murder of women in the land and in the region , and show their ref@@ usal .

the following article is the shortened and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; of cur@@ rant . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ ein@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ bin ) , which was reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to the protection of the affected persons .
a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her husband partner who had become non @-@ violent .
since the end of her relationship has been a bit of time and the police said , their statement would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
when a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , also the ac@@ ten@@ derly display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful .
a few days later , the second wife moved their ad back .
the devil &apos;s vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women have to report at all once , they do not receive any support on the part of the State .
in many cases , women are also finan@@ cially dependent on men who are mi@@ stre@@ ated . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit victims of violence to be victims of the prosecution authorities in all cases .
intra@@ 1 beats and stat@@ iti@@ c 2 un@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ 3 of Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , faulty implementation beats and statistics
it &apos;s hard to say how many women really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says M@@ yri@@ an Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ nal research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , but not even an@@ sat@@ a , the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains it .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General Public Prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads due to domestic violence . 70 % of them went on violence against women .
86 % of ads added to the police were women .
there were more than 5,000 ads caused by domestic violence in the Nobel Peace Treaty . 86 % of the total ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of the women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who has been paid in Paraguay because of psychological Mis@@ sing message , 9 women will not do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who has been reimbur@@ sed due to physical mi@@ stre@@ l ad , comes two women who do not do that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay can not be adequ@@ ately documented , the prosecution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days , a woman due to violence committed by men .

un@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not take anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that they named him the names of all their former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do it , but she was still going to regre@@ t . this should always regre@@ t it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years she bore psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zing the most difficult ones :
I never thought that I would have victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment once .
if I have read about it earlier , I thought that only women are happening to sub@@ mitting them because they are dis@@ cour@@ aged by violent men .
I was convinced that never would happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , among them also Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , if he had lifted up the hand against them and refused to be able that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen this as long as Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment should have at least a certain school@@ ing .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had mi@@ stre@@ ated them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) that consists of women , all of which are victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment in any way .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological mi@@ stre@@ l .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that they were worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities remained without the result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a trial against its former partners , which developed into an un@@ ob@@ liter@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , where it was mainly used by money , power and influence of their former partner .
Uruguay laws : good approach , faulty implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the display of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a peculi@@ ar offen@@ ders and tough@@ er how it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the Legislative text was changed in some points to also win the dep@@ uties for the law , that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is forbidden , which are currently forbidden in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft law had intended to bear the majority of the bureau@@ cratic and economic ) of the process which currently must contribute to the victims of violence against itself , if they are simply reimbur@@ sed and receive a secure accommodation to raise the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
E@@ ch@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means at the disposal :
in Paraguay Mis@@ sing is seen as part of human relations .
here , a change must be held so that violence is no longer considered a slightly Normal .
those who keep silence in view of these facts , is found guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we need to report as long indication until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ation is no more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . in this case , a passage has been cancelled , which had been calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are apart .
the passage in reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his sacrifice again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual Bel@@ iev@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman has still suspended attacks a year after the prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website was closed due to the decision of the Ministry of Information &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage about corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the ed@@ itors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served one year sentence .
two other ed@@ itors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ a Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and placed before Court , but later returned .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after he had appointed his father , Said I@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of Lebanon .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Rule of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ sh@@ al efforts of security forces , in particular by domestic intelligence , public freedom , including press freedom , responsibility and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger , and further activists , in@@ viol@@ ate and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in human rights systematically en@@ forcing and hin@@ dering citizens , even activists , to their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the invasion of three of her ed@@ itors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported in Oman since its foundation in 2007 in Oman ( absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who had appeared in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , was published an article with the title &quot; High @-@ related parties &quot; hands of justice . &quot; it was corruption in Ju@@ sti@@ zw@@ esen and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ a Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , member of the Au@@ dit Committee , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and detained at his arrival of the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the Deputy editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had been invited to be Chief Editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite period after the Ministry of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online , will be prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial of the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted among others because of the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; signatures of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found in addition to the violation of a publication and de@@ fam@@ ation for s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j had been sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year vocational ban was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having the use of &quot; an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was granted a security deposit of 5,000 ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
on 26 December 2016 Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to six months in prison on 26 December 2016 , sentenced to Al @-@ Ha@@ j on a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .

the Appeals Court also decided to close the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself as an attack by the Iranian government .
on January 8 , the Ministry of Information sent a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister concluded a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court to re@@ define the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been injured in Oman at most recent time .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , will stop their operation .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ under@@ standings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , image takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need to be used on site . there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far more serious consequences than elsewhere , and missing investment for exploring these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
second , the research that is carried out by African scientists will only be eligible for establishing own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors is Director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors at the centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
it grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious consequences for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he worked on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of the media via this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. Warri@@ ors speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I under@@ line the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
in addition I started developing a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important recent research topics in your country and univers@@ ally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
it needs to change that , otherwise , we will always be able to remain instead of himself .
the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find the suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw back here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous power supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it will take months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interesting , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
g@@ v : how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support the development ?
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
R@@ W : often , there are a limited speed , things to do , and the sc@@ ari@@ ous access to scientific expertise that represent the challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , is also limited to the amount of existing information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : such as &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers make the global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published at En@@ si@@ a@@ .com website , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been supporting salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its enterprise offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ hat , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
it was only almost 20 years old , Mort@@ ons work only through its own imagination and the question how many sal@@ ads can get it limits .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t continue to use it .
the patents are not only available for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance levels compared to diseases , a special rotor or green leaves .
over the past few years more of such patents have been applied to more plants such as grain or cardboard locations . due to these trends , plant operators , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food safety in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition M@@ orton requires a salad but still needs longer since its work is getting more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when in a river a rock bro@@ ods that I must have left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do that now , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go to salt .
and if they stop before judgment , no one can chast@@ ise any new sal@@ ts because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to get those features that he wants .
in doing so , however , it is very careful and endeav@@ oured to use not material that is protected as a spiritual property .
it also has a movement that is connected to the United States and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ aut of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman sal@@ at the variety Out@@ red@@ th in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that , then the movement from the IT sector would come and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life in order to ensure that some plant species and inhabitants are not protected as a spiritual property and can be used permanently for plant@@ ations .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can agree that others are able to freely use them from far@@ med seed .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders allow only others to buy their seed , it is not immediate hi@@ es - two aspects which are forbidden by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
d@@ inning outlook
for the retired professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Cle@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seed and the possibility of developing new plants , both important for food safety and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger combinations such as Bi@@ odi@@ vers@@ ität , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to use the latter not or just a little by taking seed with natural resistance .
clo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not that , from ecological agriculture , and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot; those who are happy to buy locally and sustain@@ ably producing vegetables , such as such as farmers , should also know the manner that the species is bred , like this vegetable is threatened .
food sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible . &quot;
members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative undertake to make others free of charge . in contrast , their anticip@@ ation is to be patented in contrast , seeds and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supp@@ orter argu@@ ing that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available gen@@ pool is due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always restricted to un@@ break@@ able .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has been employed in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all boxes are protected as a spiritual property , which means that it is un@@ usable for plant breeding either .
for other plants , there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by dis@@ cour@@ aged that mass@@ aging plants are patented like wheat in even larger style , as a salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are so bred that they feature targeted features - of such as their taste or their color improves up to such as they flour@@ ish in certain environments as well as pain or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is due to more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more powerful than ever before , because the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail you will recognize Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company uses the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contradi@@ cts the fact that spiritu@@ ally ownership other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ res .
often this instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such a protection does not in@@ hi@@ bit innovations , but it promotes it to be provided with the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
M@@ orton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent is made , and will certainly be no innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long on plants , which are adapted to plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions , the struggle would have already been lost .
the main argument for M@@ orton is however , that genetic resources have always been a general good thing and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeding neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers make their job easier .
this is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to use us if we don &apos;t continue to use the best and the latest genetic resources . &quot;
in all , M@@ orton does not distur@@ b itself at the concept of itself , plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features itself .
the plants produce them , and as bre@@ eder , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant of plant in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever den@@ ounces a sort , den@@ ounces his own values in them .
those who believe in the industrial farming with large courts and mono@@ cultures may be needed for their cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides that is specialized in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very good . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either refuse it to be expensive and therefore not worthwhile , or both are the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank M@@ orton is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ates .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also aware that bre@@ eder would be innovative by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new things more than companies that pat@@ ented more than companies .
I need constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent , one is 20 years before competition , with which one makes it easy to feel very nice . &quot;
while the USA seem to be leading in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept has meanwhile been spread quickly to around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . for receipt of the seed of traditional vegetable varieties , the center of farmers collabor@@ ated with farmers , helping them to create new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to join &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ ements is working on an &quot; Open Source &quot; License , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( prescri@@ ptions intended to be different from country to land , so because the O@@ ss@@ i commitment cannot be easily taken by one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventi@@ onally bred plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law , but now it is intended to bring the governments of the Member States to implement the new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn anything about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards sponsor@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for Open Source &quot; seed systems , is that the organisation currently acquire a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which the official start date should be dropped next year .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international N@@ on@@ profit development organization in Ero@@ sion , Technology and Conc@@ entr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers will have the opportunity to exchange and improve seeds and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply can be ensured with food .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection , from the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and environmental food has been rep@@ uted to , where , and like something , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to clari@@ fy people that there is still more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the 5th Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , in which it criti@@ ci@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue working on the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the same network for Human Rights Information Dog@@ s in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution , though it was never so difficult to defend this targets as well . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities should be exhau@@ sted to overcome the lock@@ out and do not return . we hope to fulfill our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization on wave of web pages has fallen victim to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the principal sources of human rights in Arabic language h@@ tt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ I@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research@@ ing Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of Kolum@@ nen and articles , which he does not have to include local websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up in order to deal with the appeal of the Egyptian government , was the goal of a attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider is home to Canada &apos;s blog , on the other hand is accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after having been arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student prot@@ est and taken a video as the police pursued physical violence against two students .
his articles will turn mainly to politics and human rights issues in Egypt .
in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the lock by the government and reflecting what this means to him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is succeeded to medi@@ ate me the feeling of a siege ; a arrest , attempted murder , pre@@ loading during the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I &apos;d like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I took it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have locked it , and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the bra@@ ve go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian officials from 24 May to 06 August 133 pages . this produced technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE , also documented the blocking of providers by using Internet search and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12 June we noticed how the lock of Web sites that VP@@ N@@ s started .
such practice att@@ ests to the intention of the government to block content and fil@@ tering on the Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally changed in addition to the doors being made behind the doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis in which they can proceed in court against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day by day , newspapers in all Brazil will report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro were murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army , navy and air dol@@ ee to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation the violence shaft in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are single daily and this is in@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus published the detailed reporting on violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to establish a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the following moti@@ ves for their decision declared the paper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city in the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , and all that happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to conclude that as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video which was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , there will be controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial writing , the newspaper writes :
we know that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , gr@@ am@@ eless of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of Maf@@ ia and their partners .
is the name &quot; war &quot; more than it is used ?
in an article on the News portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to describe violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion after a just@@ ification of failed security policy by the media and might make it difficult to express responsibility for the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and an historical and self @-@ pleasing negle@@ ct of the public service .
as a reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the non @-@ violent town in Brazil is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 to the north and nor@@ theastern states . these are the most current data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the murder rates per state , Rio is on position 16 , &quot; she writes .
in addition , extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , emphas@@ ises such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been re@@ iter@@ ated the state policy of the State since years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 , belonged to the establishment of a massive police station to conquer a Fav@@ ela , and permanently stationed a unity .
at the beginning this was actually to be a decline of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP had to protect against several reports about ch@@ ai@@ anas and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities that actually had to protect the newly created police unit increasingly .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Charle@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the state to use means of resources and ways which are typical for a war . this is a penet@@ rating point in the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; Coll@@ ateral Damage &quot; and &quot; mistaken balls . &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation Pa@@ x and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib at present some one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 caused the life of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations , and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was done by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these controlled rebel areas have been under siege under the siege under the siege of Damascus , which led inhabitants on local or through tunnels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gla@@ sting block@@ ade , traditional food items such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian assistance and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they themselves call G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their health benefits however contributes to an attractive dietary source for many residents of besieged east G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direct link of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushroom because they have a high nutritional value like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organis@@ ers , reported Global Vo@@ ices that already fought for three years , this project had been known and pressed his relief , making it now more and more . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as .
it is planned to medi@@ ate 125 families of knowledge about the plantation of mushroom , such as Dr. Le@@ ila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they reached over 100 % of its expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators , keeping the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel short@@ ness , locally produced fuel materials are used in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of from the regions of the fung@@ al seeds &quot; before they checked their quality and they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this was achieved , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apprenti@@ ce building for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they all have mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Le@@ ila stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach the people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons : &quot; fra@@ cture of the siege .
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ catering , re@@ lics ( such as paper , tea , coffee rate , cart@@ on , etc ) to the extraction of new foods .
create new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege are visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese request justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people were protest@@ ing on 21 October in many regional cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that killed in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two persons died , and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in that the government had a last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spreading itself in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Grande r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred on a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest management system that monitors the forest area by satellite photos , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon alone .
so that you can make a better image from the Ernst of the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .
quite Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users split images :

numerous videos spread on the web , and show images that allow better insights into the game :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the target of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civil protection was not able to prevent the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al inspired by the Federation of the farmers in Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , since the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits will be called in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ end@@ omet@@ ry with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a far @-@ reaching proposal to the whale @-@ form , which had introduced the government after severe fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the commun@@ es that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the activity of the case - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization trans@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus trees made of light com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this species continued to spread .
in addition to these problems , the site of civil protection from Portugal on October 15th and October 16th , when people sought information or attempted to contact members , was offline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided by the application . it used its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time across the location and spread of fires . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who followed fires , the site counted more than half a million .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

during one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group , who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni on the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say that time , she knew that she would not see her son very long , - maybe even more .
the boy should break up in the morning .
his uncle would pick him up and bring it to the tugs .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many haz@@ ara felt suddenly .
those who were for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara did always come closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hor@@ net . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were harder than he himself to earn his living .
at that time , as today , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were min@@ ted from mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ har@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site at which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon before the open window , so we don &apos;t mo@@ ors at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ har@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to the needy .
indeed , Italy is true that Italy is a great chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high inflation rates . however , it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers are disa@@ stro@@ us in the country .
the human rights organization of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special training centers &quot; in the hands of impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an acceptance centre if they have officially placed an application for asylum - which can take place for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money to have an accommodation either on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also ai@@ af .
but his vital life helped A@@ har@@ af to free from these conditions soon .
after having made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af formed his entire savings in Venice &apos;s establishment in Venice .
this was so good that after a while , he opened a second hostel , and opened a s@@ elli@@ pse .
A@@ mir Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Dis@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has already been presented for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - mainly for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan operated companies , including gu@@ ardian , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the winery and the kitchen staff members are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is nar@@ rated by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts , the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also an Afghan .
however , A@@ gath@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic business and retailers back to the country that he had to leave ci@@ bly as teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my land and I can not live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ af den@@ otes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ ving technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their seri@@ ousness on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .
Ne@@ ti@@ ces Report : Legislative Decree out of Egypt permit penetration of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported about the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , who prot@@ ested against the decree of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament is checked in a draft law , which proposes that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
users would have to use to use social networks within six months after the submission of the legislative decision on the website of the authority , stating their complete name and their registration number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the En@@ tri@@ bution of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently subject to legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , a further member of the Chamber of Dep@@ uties would be to be introduced in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced for the in@@ dem@@ nity of the President or a high civil servants .
under the Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President as well as state institutions may already be pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the Legislative Decree , such a matter would act with prison and monetary policy , right @-@ wing experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convi@@ ctions .
in addition , this would be a political climate , in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took on violence against prot@@ esters that demonstrated violence against the military coup that led to the official President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ants who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a court appointment .
recently his trial was postponed to the 20th May , because the prison deriv@@ ative according to human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the court@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threat@@ ening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , head@@ burden from among others ce@@ ase@@ fire , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also detained at the previously mentioned fall , aged 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists to pass through trans@@ sigh@@ ted documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was interro@@ gated mainly to a sealed action plan , which was expressly backed by the President of the Republic , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali of corruption , if they restore all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , presents a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ als will look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the separation of his sources in accordance with Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Centre , which guarantees the right to protect their sources on the protection of their sources .
despite this , he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness .
wants to force the user of social media to submit their identification ?
according to new rules of the Information Management Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit to write or share messages in social media .
in terms of requirements , the registration will be necessary with the full real name .
analy@@ tics showed that through the elimination of anonymous comments on social networks can be reached within social networks . it is now un@@ clear as the authorities shall apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese Social citizens are proposed in the social media , to asser@@ t these provisions only sel@@ ective in order to protect civil journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then we &apos;ll see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship en@@ cep@@ ted the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or sunk We@@ Chat to register in the state government as a &quot; organisation of information pro@@ lifer@@ ation . &quot;
this name is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government organiz@@ es a list of information . &quot; the law also permits the government to make it responsible for removing content and force them on request for compensation of user data .
these web pages are currently using websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ classic ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has sper@@ lashing Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the sperm mot@@ ion@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English language articles , the information , Turkey line support the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and Communication has been closed , because it is being locked on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to address a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , in addition to other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .

after this week , the government of Great Britain is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to high security concerns , which would be to monitor Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install a Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted the telecommunications company and confi@@ denti@@ ality in regard to the pro@@ filing , but has other technology companies and the civilian population left outside .
