<seg id="1">Although I visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceptionally big.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, I have picked up American music, American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a similar effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the local conspiracy of a oil painting with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura student who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I always said:" "" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so inviting you can always be who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very shattery love letter over his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his engagement.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says, what he thinks, like a former colleague, express his express, and explained publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support these bigs person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring down Trump and his voters in harmony with the people that I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, receives people from all over the world, a deeply glorious human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps has also agreed not to agree with the editor of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerances is also reflected in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr which fights for their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes that always helped me with much patience and suffering from me and my colleagues helped us to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser council helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those people and those committed by them preperated my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump has bagued his way to the nominee Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that it was the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for trump, because they were either shared his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost the heart beat me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to describe the trump voters as a rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To inarrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think of a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most, are white, have voted for trump, because they want to re-win control of a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick, who committeth the cruel decision, commenting a man who looks down with contempt to those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "white elash" "" "(Annod.).: as much as" "" "refusal to the White and whiplash" "" "in white in connection to the White and whiplash, what the big Van Jones called" "" "does exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - what faith, or background you may always have, America's welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenianer, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white American of this promise and says: to hell with many, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all these things I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd of human beings.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"have Muslims in a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone who is not so like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an impressive and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, is it not your America." 36 hours later he was deposed.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who like this like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaketh me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that played at both places is not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the refuse</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump located just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city which is very popular among the tourists, but worlds away from nearby villages and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Music banger) has been playing in the community: one of the children and adults of the symphony orchestra, which has found a possibility for overcoming poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school-school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The congregation, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the banker violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hopes.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their duties towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI means:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to reflect her great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come and play with glossy eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timbrel, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically the top of the biggest waste dump of AsunciÃ³n in the capital of Paraguay, which are made of recompensated waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violins, Celli, guitars, sails, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez recalls a local oil biologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, in the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the garbage. they didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed slightly as Favio something which he had never seen before: a made of waste made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made from recovered material, called The Recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) features the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest, like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they will transform it in something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspired show of garbage-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music by Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights the wild fishing fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that provides targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens in the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated in liaison waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly high above accordingly, and inclined little to call a criminal law to their coasts on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the commissioner, Mozambique and the Seychelles rapidly opposed the ship. they refused to get one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries which all refused to be refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing industry. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and pursued." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia because of pillaging the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal (Illegal Fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar around six countries, who then had driven the premier out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are to be able to work together. they exchange information and stand mutually at where there are illegal fishing." "" "Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending is illegal. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped, it is hidden because it is extremely difficult because illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the obvious abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems will harm a delaying balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and through the snow-empicko, with the information between individual countries, the actions nowadays happen in real-time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries, for example, exchange lists of existing licenses, or details that, during a harbour spection, can be noticed or experienced.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fishing in forbidden areas. even so suspects driving routes - about such that suggest that a ship invites his caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case such studies show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal catch-catch can deny the acceptance of such ships in their ports, which means that ships can't sell their cargo load, and that they could even be forced to pay the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then a significant financial losses for the owner, what means illegal fishing is financially worthwhile anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an adviser company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to gain a loss of USD 20 million to lost revenues, who lost eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fishing in East Africa, which attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these even illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices, among other things, actions can count as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of imagination, the fish protected species and fish in protected areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation with the lack of international cooperation," "" "says Long." "" "in former times a ship could be illegal and a country could say" "" "You reject my port not running." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legitimate gorpinch tried to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigative ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed to criminal networks which fake the fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been persecuted and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing across great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organizational crimes," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i, the suspect ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be refined, helps unloading the illegal ships to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems, with which they can't be stored by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information panels. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of each individual tracking ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "hammunun with the neighbors, to get a better image of it, who does what does it makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run on which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also refresh them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used sooner without a license and hardly have to be reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now sold a 33% increase in fisheries, since fisheries has more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors were mounted on board towing network, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these achievements. "the effect is so strong that we can also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study of study." in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear every year by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. however, they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With safety, even more such initiatives and structures may also be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member Somalia could report his first great triumph in October: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was traveling under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and have been banned in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was still in banned waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking the rules of dimensional rules against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such special, collaborative occupational collaborative work is actually working in the entire world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of strong demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the resignation of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country, in which they gathered themselves together on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return order of Venezuela) can be found in both pictures from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also led in other parts of the country - amongst other things in the rural district of Barinas, in the Andenregions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, centrally located in the north-north federal federal state Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva asparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country worsened continuously, which makes itself the everyday life of Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medications.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance for a fundamental change; ultimately, however, the offsetting of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the context of the government decree as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and economic crisis has been among the highest around the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% on the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the only way to abandon its institutional structures and to close its institutional structures.</seg>

<seg id="165">The appeal was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news about police raid in the central town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There, the protesters moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government's own statement, in front of the police and armed advocacy of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the state of TÃ¡chira:</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was conducted on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said in Quijano as part of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were examined crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden to bear the same name as his father to bear the brutal military operations at La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15 he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I thought that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years we don't know that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I couldn't know that my father was a thief, Folterer and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarsenator. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressed, who was charged for abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who knew the extent of the atrocities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy, who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent of his child and like this child chose for himself a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the Military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had cheered myself with a boy, the martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All named him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and called me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are a wicked hole, you have made you friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't have a day, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he banned me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me at the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university inclusions, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda, books, simple everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'dah, the prisoners will be tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he made me waiting at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to get off. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of them was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little in a blanket, and commanded me to take it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barrack, where the stolen objects were shut down and held me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I seams in, and saw a song that were tortured on man.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person, which was just encircled there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely hold a man with handcuffs on the bed, shot him with water, and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stank there was dirty there... like a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I knew the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget that smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself, how is it possible that a man can sorry for another so much suffering?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father brought me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and to bind ocular.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also accused in the process) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people were bound with the face down - all were bound at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people stopped quietly on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were cast into a pit, and killed by soldiers, and was buried.</seg>

<seg id="262">The way to which you came in here is also the way, on which the kidnapping came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of abstaining.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they had survived the torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the arrangement of up came to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - Euphemism - for shooting the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things to home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "warfare" - how they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was even during the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - it was clear to me that the spoils are a bayonet or maybe military signs which you have fought against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the fridge, turntables, clothing, paintings, money... stive, then this is not a warfare but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked how my father, the leader of security forces, could take part in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the Gendarmerie and I would never have like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime, and I answered, And thou that seduce you cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded with anger, struck me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and destroy you.</seg>
<seg id="283">For this we need no other one!</seg>
<seg id="284">Thus my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not only good memories of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I started out in the process, I showed a photo of that time, on which I wore a jacket and a wheel pullover of wool. both my father had from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence asked me to have compassion for this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay down to me for load what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to speak.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last adventurous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I'm remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you only have children, one recognizes the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognize that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have executed so during the dictatorship of Man, but why the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children deduce?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always turned the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have just been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these men not even families, which could be handed over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last remote act that you can do with a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was introduced, they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and lost somewhere - no idea, where. "you will never find something," said my Father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was at the Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea, to show my Father, was created during a meeting when he stood under house arrest.</seg>

<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes, and you have forced me to participate in a child.</seg>

<seg id="345">This photo was disseminated in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Arrangement of the original photos of Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving licence, in the last month witnesses of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "in a sign the Japanese word" "" "is the Japanese word (covet sha), the" "" "older drivers" "" "means," "" "perhaps too, but also translated with evil hints & # 8212; as" "" "terrible driver" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to read on electronic ads from 1 to 20 September in the input field and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos of Joshua Levine, divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos, who was also attentive to the local time.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun was published in Kyoto:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an excuse for older people and in an international city as KYOTO just inacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was initially removed. the name "the drivers" (German: "terrible driver") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammar not quite correct name "Elder drivers" (German: "older drivers") was replaced.</seg>
<seg id="357">The police prefecture were excused in the Kyoto period. furthermore, they stated that the error was already contained in the text which they had received from the translator and that the translation was not tested for their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "sorry, that older people felt aggraded with inadequate correction (the translation) on our part" "", "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-cast News was somewhat detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was enacted as an adequate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are still involved in accidents.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for instance, in 2005 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1.803 recorded a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This puts their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of seniors caused by seniors over the same period has risen.</seg>
<seg id="366">Named as named reporter, published on Yahoo released version of the article comments on the Light, which show the advantages of a few Japanese apparently opposed to older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation error received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "is this (" "" "terrible driver" "" ") about the reality?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "" "" "so the translation is actually not at all, or?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that this is a real translation error."</seg>
<seg id="371">There are not few such comments.</seg>
<seg id="372">Why "Engrish" in all Asia is so common</seg>
<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">The website Engrish.com is a true place of discovery for these bizarre errors in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">To transition, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active retention of the target language - something that is in the native languages of the case. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native language should translate into French French French - not from the French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as the mother tongue to produce translations into English. this may be a lack of understanding for the transfer, reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers who are to learn from Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even have no foreign staff, have translations made of proprietary, then the Japanese staff, whose knowledge of English as the best ones, are made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The promised propositions which are created by machine translations will show that this technology can not replace any human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulation in Japan, among them also decorate the rentiful prints, which are often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for style reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless or at least harmless. but of great companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navbercon Libertad" (Freies Surfs) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users informed that they don't have access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet recording of VPITV and El Capitolio TV could not be accessible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters were also presented by the protests in Caracas, which were organised by oppositionally groups, which was opposed to the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the leaders of the Parliament had transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is glued, and recommended to use the Users, VPN (Virtual Private Networks) to access access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet-Venezuelan providers are again blocked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been deferred on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with monetary policy and closure when they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as "Call to Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informational national TV channels I have logged in at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of Limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfiltrate was later confirmed that not only Vivoplay may not be accessible through a lockout of the domain name System (DNA), but also two further online transmitter. this also applies the website to transfers their sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous investigations by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group of digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local internet provider will be using DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS server inquiries should have been incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server does not respond or denied the request when calling on such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elapoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-perched channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV-Camera Elvis Flores, who took the protests in Caracas live in detention.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates the internet connections. therewith, the Venezuelans will continue to continue access to multi-media coverage over the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("fetal cows, falling schools") that will be processed and re-released by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Just before her academic degree at the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house full of pride of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "those who have become something of something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas they are called in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a big family with little money over her less year old son or her younger daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned here is that the children must never pay for countless days of housework which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that in the framework of a contract which is not able to lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice was widely used as Criadazgo in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating from studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She said with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected stuff, reworked and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to call the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the crimped, guarantees generally not silent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deformation," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who make their daughter in the faith that they are able to complete their position in society, improve their position in society and make "something of itself" to make a different family. "</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that receives the girl with him and whose exploitation is justifying with the faith that they would give someone a chance that would not have been trained and perhaps even was starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience a lot of years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon which takes place in paraguayan households in January 2016, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came into the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of severe strokes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the budget of the former members of the former members of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer in the residents of the population.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived in her home in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">By the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck the invasion on MarÃ­n until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They were concreted that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">As UNICEF or Callercuela, the deeply moved in the paraguayan society of the Criadazgo practice responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there will be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to hurt the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded an extensive investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case is in case of judgment, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be welded - if the first time in the history of Paraguay was a case of Criadazgo before the Court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited for workers, they also live isolated from other girls in her age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register and her father had lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the work and began to sell money on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, she had to share the time that you still stayed for learning.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, modified by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections have recently agreed to draft law on the regulations concerning the use of the use and use of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by the Parliament, users must register to use social media in Egypt in a governmental office to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law it would be set up a place that is commissioned to use citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users would have to register within the site of the site with their right name and personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it will be missed to do this, this might take a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment or a fine money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, consists in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defined social media as "every application which runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"" "" "" "it is unclear when the draft law is going through, as Egyptian authorities shall not raise the user to date. unclear is also that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on level of social media enterprise." ""</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sadar, parliamentary committee and conveyors of the Legislative Decree, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password "to come across the firewall, the Facebook has blocked."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to establish a firewall on national level around Facebook. because of them it would be necessary for Egyptian and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts from the site are skeptical concerning the technical feasibility of the precaution.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technological (based on German "executive research scholar,") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "I doubt strongly in the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology." ""</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they were forcibly to control physical public and private spaces that could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, this means that they will apply a strong monitoring system to filter a citizen or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically very realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft agreement has to be discussed at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it comes into the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "is in conformity with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in which sense should be controlled and ensured that no deviating narration on the image area is present," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawk proposed a legislative situation against cyber crime, in which a lifelong sentence for those intended to be found guilty of threaten the "public order" and "to protest" to protest. "</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem, and the health and the prosper of the ecosystems also depends on that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards in the wild boggan run is small and goes against zero. when the team in video shows that it is a recording of a big cat in the camera all, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, documented in northeastern Japan, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years have been hit by the "Thirdly catastrophe" of March 2011. an extensive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a few prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had vanish all coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made in local perspective for six years, to re-establish the lives of local-based companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper comprises both statistics of the Japanese revival authority and the survey results of the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitute for spare parts (to-it is to be in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwata has completed 75 percent of such buildings, whereas at 70 percent, Iwata is due to the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Similarly, you are still trying to settle for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelapag (to which of which is to be casusu juutaku) in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-way catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emerges, whereas Miyagi had been successful on this occasion, whereas more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which had been evacuated according to the disaster in the pension, were moved into definitive homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Ithate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">Of work and daily life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 out of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their doors again opened up to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of fisheries are resumed their use in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and atomic disaster took place in the three prefectures agricultural land large area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 acres of 5 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima country, are located in the nuclear plywood zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered far again, but also Fukushima remains a far off again.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist tax in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima happened here, on the other hand, only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it was more difficult to earn their lives.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous grants among the native population and the evacuated by the evacuation. she asked them about the state of restoration and also how their reception has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey by more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken in order to be preparing to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had been evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has directed their attention to the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima didn't only need to see the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness to the worst, disastrous accident that had to be experienced in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people were moved back to Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand of 2017 there is still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation areas in the disaster areas are most of the evacuated hausen, older than 50 years old. they have to prevent the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. this involves construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games that will be held in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish Zuckermacchairs - known, regardless of that there is no significant sucking sugar in the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when activities in the sugar tubes mill were laid.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the awakening, the sugar tubes industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost to and after its plants, until only the rumor from steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers were forced to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commute every day to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands up every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar tubes industry does not provide his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region sugar tubes are in operation, which after a long inactive time, they were in operation because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds exactly that in MaÃ±as I would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tubes industry has already the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the Ineffefficiency, the poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the land some decades ago, but the bad harvest could already exist any more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar tubes industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar tubes were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unusable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar tubes and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the cost of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "agricultural spectively" from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production level would reach the level of 2001 (3,6 million tonnes), the raw sugar would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today the day will go down in history," "" "the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro visited the sugar factory in Lavandero during his speech on 21 October 2002." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the disclosure of a total of 98 sugar tubes were made, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as the soldier, about the closure of the factory speaks, is the word that he repeats most repeatedly, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to maintain the place, they constituted a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first escape, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially declared documents that only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed, the addressat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Uli Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any removal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters came more often.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the set-down factory for two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money, which he had in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in his will at the disclosure of the factory, during which it helped to take part.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part, which he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for work sites and services that were generated in the communities in which they were found.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the referendum of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±as I learned that many things are changing, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory closed, or even better when they started to take them off, they also listened to asphaling the road, and also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, nene and Eddy other factories had to open.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations-communities in all Canada have dealt with topics that are important for them. they do it by Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour since 2014 he has worked directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagoges of David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in northern Quebec, with ten Cree-hop and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will show that the young participants in conversations, such as "cultural identity," language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever they can find in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations-communities in the British Columbia's Canadian province, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important of the receipt of traditional sleigh and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, will be shown close to the entrance to shokuhin sanpuru (to which, to which, to which, "placental models of dishes") are served by any food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes, and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the district of Kappabashi there is a multitude of these small companies that produce these plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes usually are usually that they don't even call them all. a new trend, however, is transformed into conspicuous mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic shells decorated cell bands such as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitten collective collection, as in this case, cooling cabinet:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shocks freezer for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food items will become increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for the mobile phone, it is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of a growing trip to the county.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and mobile-designers allow you to manufacture your own work of art. in this case, ikura and salmon were cheated, any popular topping, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetite form, to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of ice cream ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For further information rile plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the Twitter The Hashtag # to, to the level of which is the same.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against the drug trafficking in Mexico, the missing and transmissions occur regularly in statistics. this, however, do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the chief of the Sinaloa carton, pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks to those who mourn, or to the communes who have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind any LEICA, behind every bone refund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican News portal Animal PolÃ­tico called the "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking,") and stories of people who are talking about the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime lets us not just fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug hands and so many congregations have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" "" "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how anxiety lives" "" ") tells about that stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who seeks secret graves after his son.</seg>

<seg id="767">On October 13th he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was back again, but he never returned. Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father's insurance, but she won't pay them out because they require a dying.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only need to show the faces of those who fear the fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, breakage and the state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on readers of readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, regardless of what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have now known illness and Sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"" "" "" "I'm passing through newspaper kiosks every day and see the cover pages with images that can actually come from a textbook for criminology or made of specialists." ""</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel the feeling as if I am the only one who was annoyed or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be valid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin will think that he is big. and it's not normal that people hear about the "heroic" of offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is how they were those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who have anxiety that something has happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories are to blot numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The obelessness of man is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were wrong. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are attempting to talk of such tragedies, if they are not stirring, and still are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four month Erpressings in the main district:" as a family with threats of threats, it describes how armed detective month for month money from their business, until they were not only destroyed the business, but also had torn her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain is never passing away, the sadness remains, the fear comes back, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "we want to be arrested for the others, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, if weeping would dissolve my frozen feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence recorded."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he throws questions like this: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents themselves take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells himself that he had to take himself like a egg, boiled potatoes, tortillas, and make "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with that.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody bodies of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born in Bryan, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a violence through the organised crime and struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders on public safety and government Council of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecution numbered 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate them into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories will continue to live in view of the new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, created the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the past four decades, in an intelligible manner.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to lift up a rumor to unlargement.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something is dipped for the first time? content in social media, regardless of whether or untrue, tends to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to study tragedies, which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This wrong coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it throws questions about our longing to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. 230 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa was neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous ploughs full of impact, which were difficult to travel.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker came to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">The deputy representatives described a fire ball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas in the vicinity, which was full of people who loved the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Ruined houses were scattered and foal bodies scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">The above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized body, which are rounded up on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was inscribed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but that was not likely to be attributed to the tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram was captured by Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically by atrocities which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and sweet.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count the dead bodies," "" "said one inhabitants to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were killed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up may be presented.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also reflected, but the army Corps in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here a picture from the DR Congo disappeared again, as proof for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of malnutrition; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was taken as a proof for massages.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even one step further bring personal comments such as this example, the photograph from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange joined forces with the deadly persecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash of lightning, published by the United Nations, those who could flee bats, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported as the following to summarize these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi-Arab news page which was falsely affected by the President Myanmars Than He said that monks and politician had taken part in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the DR-Congo picture to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original entry, which was last updated on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, the AFP mentioned as its source, had also been falsely affected by this statement, but did not allow the image of the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world-wide range of false data</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these counterorders have to date back to 2011 and 2012, and actually comes from everywhere around the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the help of an interview, you can see how far more information can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">The search engine with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures below 18.8 billion images (as of 3 May 2017) and 344 pictures, which are very similar to the depicted picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They are from a mixing mask private parties, platforms of social media and community publications and national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) that pull them through. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of major debates about silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second frame uses the image to discuss how an African life is evaluated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it's worth to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens if readers can no longer give this pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are many people who have committed unintended to destroy the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this mood of misery and fallow information that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The prevalence of violent images have already been debated in detail (e.g., for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the retention of pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that forcible pictures and viewers are desiring to receive the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, undersought how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss nonviolent representations in the media media, fact it is that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists have experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to think about the situation in which a picture can be somewhat suggests, which is actually replaced by the context or to completely misused species.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) endeavours to offer language skills to provide a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they oppress certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well known (as the famous Portuguese Saudi Arabia) and others who have been rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist hard-neckly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes something is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words, while the author and reading is by "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the VAT language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Keep you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to get you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth which you feel after one gets in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They remove other cultures, unveil other ideas and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site even more of these "unmistakable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to upload their favourite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women will be forced to bear their head cloth in public buildings and to cover Saudi women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way, here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone to enter in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), there is a possible response of stories in its original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird, the Unremovable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the language diversity of large cities and to be worthy.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has been carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not forwarded to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we create cities that accept diversities - safe spaces, in which residents are not forgotten, who they are to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often so often to understand" "" "to understand these events" "" "instead, to appreciate, to feel" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, Dune observers make their story first in their own language and translate or explain them to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional Dexteral count, their devotion will lead and their presentation means that the listener will be on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso that is told in the language Dafing. during that round, the Dassidators Rassidatou consult the opportunity to explain which to their country's typical customs of narrative.</seg>

<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive to...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS in order to organize their own skills.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new investigation of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place in 72 million US dollars on April 3, 2017, various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puertoricane Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda," (civil front for the neural testing of the debt) and the ectopical church meeting of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocacy of the debt of debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos requires that politicians, barians and government authorities, who are responsible for debts, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions of appropriate compensation, which is in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay debts, which is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not take off with decreasing retirement payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate measures.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-profit non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socioeconomic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on the outside are without participation in the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrically Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missed for over one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions that he performed for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture that is held in Berlin annually, devoted to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©riie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist who manufactures in France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, read out excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquion (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published in the last year and is licensed here, contains a number of paragraphs that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of freedom of knowledge, have worked on site to look beyond the fog, which gives our newsfeeds to create something out of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prisons in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title College memory gives his friends and his family a voice that want to push for his release and want to know it back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">As Bassel has paid a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us let us begin to reflect on their own destinies, deeds, and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here tonight?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for what?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we do in this process of times by extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper of Open Source and Digital activist has been in the detention centre of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was made up of the Adra prison, a non-military facility, transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly geheim "marked by the military tribunal in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who had submitted themselves to himself as the Insider of the Assad government, and they were aware of any alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition remains unknown, but remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in order to expand access to the internet and to the knowledge of public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical psychologist and currently supercharged the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps one of Basement cultural prototypes have been predictive as the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the annexation of many civilizations and merge into Greek Roman-Roman architecture types with hic traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would set everything about it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike train into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be used to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Bassel could not complete this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"" "" "" "I have spent my entire life to dream of freedom and blossy taught me to embrace them." ""</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he was already in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge of shared with everyone who has asked. he taught other inmates, to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened my gate to the technology. he taught me both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other inmates, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without the fact that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi's author is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a prostitute, which she wrote in prison from 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They violate the texts to him when they visited him, and he translated them out of the Arab to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is free available.</seg>

<seg id="1228">It is happening at every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sincerned in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in that moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the hazards are not matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, chains and watchmen</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the scrutiny of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1237">And I invite another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I turned back quickly to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To bring to all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile on your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of the monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Basle History is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the regime of Bashar al-Assets since the beginning of the protests in 2011, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Human Rights) has disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or were executed by violence through the regime, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, since 2011, at least 17.723 Syrians died in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community calls for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: sentenced to previous post due to corruption;</seg>
<seg id="1255">Muslim reacted to a corruption of corruption in which a government member, after half of his sentence, returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is a Diodino Cambaza who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants because of contamination of 54 million Meadal (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was made of public money from Mozambique, which he ruled by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and asked immediately his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which claims for the application, there wouldn't be an obstacle to Cambaza in order to obtain his old post as the company was not a disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not called the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution which sets itself for public transparency, denounced in an interview with the German Wave, the decision of the company to reintroduce the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Puts a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and even a step in relation to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware that the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the contradictations.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was silent, however, and causes no adequate legal steps to use the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well as viewed as "contradicted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to imprisonment and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could pay lectures and motivating Speeches, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has entered into the company to be reintegrated into the firm, which he helped damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistors!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Vidays, young Mosambience and student of political science in Brazil, says the director no Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded from the state because he insult him, I can not believe that one has rewarded someone in such a way that has already offended the State.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, only the state has served.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a handler to become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was then convicted and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mosambik, Samora Machel to remind that a thief was in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel the Mosambikaners will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, cutting, and - as a prophecy, prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous depictions was, when he confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of being able to sell their own individual interest, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said: "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not the case. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is discriminated at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also taught:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was sitting 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company, in which he defile money, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - in accordance with the agreement. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - in March 12, 2017 (@ azmal _ Rafik), May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook has blocked the racial word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means Kirierbse or spit bage.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known societal network accepted their posts from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Though more than the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar," or to that of which, (in burmesischer script) as a part of an initiative to tackle the widely adopted problem of Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely abrupt connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as a Hassence against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to combat the Hassary in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word to itself is not calling automatically Hassary.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts or for the purpose of their use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmesan even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter as well as other words as' Kalar pae '(spline age),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooseutzer Aung Kaat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in spirit-rich way, whether they could learn how he could relieve his back pain, having made a word-game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "Cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmisch - resembles the rassistic expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hres is the opinion that they may reduce the language of radical nationalists, but also emphasised that Facebook has to be analytical to spread all the policemen that occurred in the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatic will not understand what you write to facets.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, is carefully analyse the post and control it by check the words below.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spar bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this three nationalists will spread the Hasslanguage, a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to protect its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action is to send a strong signal to everyone to spread the Hasslanguage, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have demonstrated that the censorship of keywords are often a catz- and mouse game, with the users of social networks just start to use a new word or an alternative write of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myate described how Facebook started to delete its Posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I attentive to this new Directive on Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post of Facebook was removed and me the liken, post and parts of content has been interrupted for 24 hours because the post office does not unlock the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from people who have no negative intentions, or simply try to show their opinions against the Hassi of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with Hassi:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassence from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious foundations are badly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have to do more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask counsel:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a beneficial intent to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but this does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">With such words, only more hatred will be presented within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems, as if they have begun to have begun without local context or technical support and have banned words such as "chair" or "pesencurry".</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they did not try to report the falsibly dissolved podium.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automated censorship has been saved for a lot of users among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are using Facebook fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if their policemen are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook panel that abstained no Hassary, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch the pesencurry and look at a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook is the post that contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On June 9, 2017, the country's Parliament approved unanimously a law which is to offer this practice, so that the marriage is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the spouse, some members of the Central and Muslim religious groups held in practice, and in May 2016 brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group that gathered representatives from the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not interfere with the state that the state does not have the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This was unnoticed by the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's rights Convention, the minors as defined, every human being under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 there were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Ministry of Central Office confirmed that between 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media moves that endeavouring to abolish laws at children's toe, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they don't hesitate to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went very smooth.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns among the critics of the children's before, they were damned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This type of religious opposition was incomplicated for stresses in this actually uncomplicated matter, and some doubts were doubt if the opposition would agree to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, in early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's toe - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of opposition and an independent that contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave Facebook an status update, which has once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of Bill was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one decided on it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users was enthusiastic, because the laws have been finally changed to children before finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Member of Lovell Francis, who was a ministerial department in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary words needed to wear the core of the matter, but you know what? the children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was Jackson's opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overhappy that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Hervortex News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The married law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 - 0 against it!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who hears the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that is quite open to it, said:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years independent of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft of the spouses was adopted today, June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The House of Representatives has 41 deputies and 35 of them were present at the voting.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All the deputies, who were opposed to law, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's toe is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # 5 marriageischilda.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the well-known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">2 months ago, Maharaj told his intention to undertake a judicial steps, should the law be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a peness of the law, thought that Maharaj would like to do against the law, most social media users would like to do the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear satellite when we, instead of keeping the discussion as generally speaking, in a way that we would like to talk to the state into our bedroom, that it may be possible to dismisuse our daughters that they might be misused in the advantage, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a court case against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legal to legal or continue the standard, even though there are laws that they teach them.</seg>

<seg id="1396">Although many techniques were used to block instruction tools for block web pages (a current article published by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has shut down articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, you will find regular blockzations of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second largest country in the world, when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be closed, several Mirror pages (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia are reflected and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform created all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator calculator connections), which does not make it difficult on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>

<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked round about, never satisfied. they were awake with poisonous motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We motivate him to wear a camera with himself and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune animal world endeavoured to bring to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And its home right next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct attention to Nepals animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wild animal photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gather Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to gnash images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to obtain an cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition of Nepals Nature and would like to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so furious, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood before him face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb from the opinion of sheep not in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also due to the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the heaviest appeared. he immediately sets off, we look forward and starred me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly stayed in a tent to make recordings of Otter's National Park recordings. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content-sharing convention here.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there must be women with greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a ponomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chatriisgarh to Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women that they must respect the husband because of social pressure as well as the fear of the consequences, they should be violated the standard, this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state Obesa by a court court and cast off by her family and the village of the village, after she had talked with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives did not call on the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less legitimate instructions to fear if at all, they should not come after this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals, as well as domestic women, a unique club, were therefore quickly become the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they discuss the details of the patriarchate and discuss it.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs which exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the community video Volunteers and relies on the dismantling of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pap has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the discovery of practices, such as children's council up to the expiry of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides those clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how this clubs have created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made at the same time as ambassador of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion group, acted by women who didn't call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify the women.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not according to the names of their husbands, is a brilliance that they all have to be found guilty and never turned into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition bears that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't like this is considered to be a cunning, as a woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never made us up to this discussion round thought.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband so far in his name, try to try out how it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion lap of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained for a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should call him down by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion with this self-confidence in Bagini.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "". some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to step discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, meaning that they should not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands above the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Waloth in Maharashtra over the Breath of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women to the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that, during the whole exercise, it was just before moving and another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family, by allowing it to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition to the adrenal frenzy, in addition to having an ancient brilliance, the women decided that they were actually trying to name their husbands in their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas she sat in his head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law envied her, she was afraid, and told that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini said that I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in attendance was less understandalone and the situation existed in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the spouse:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred dot if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women didn't have stopped completely, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion group is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are doing a trip with any discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't like to make sure that women make sure what could hear," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and spoke about things about which they had never made thoughts before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems since so many years and yet I also have about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands, never so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been carried by Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt of a trousers, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of war and discussion on the advantages of their own clothes-election, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, muggling Rohini their own pair of curtas (upper hematy) into a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can bear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion group has changed slightly, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they listened to saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them, including me, do not make it, but only if they are alone, and no other family members are here.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands, only one or two wives now bear at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives, like the feeds of more freedom of movement or their own clothes-election - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman goes in the club home and other people reported that we are talking about what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and to combat precautions.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has held attention in the international community, after his attorney had announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state of state), having responded to the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred the case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and said," "" "he did not consider it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel prize-winning and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, allowing it to allow for a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While several countries have criticized the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, others have completely covered the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Drawing Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu to get a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to release questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into the stores, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government admitted that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to re-expire to China, because exports since 2010 were mostly blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the message had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision where China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leaders of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as described in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We look at the same time that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet all visits and receive, which they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "US ambassador Terry Branstad shared that the Americans" "" "would like to him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad so that it would be helpful to him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary-Polley, gave the news agency AFP to release the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The announcement of the US Embassy moved out a raging response from China to itself, with the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to invite themselves to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley divided that China should offer the couple of following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to the medical care of his choice, based on them according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international commitments.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senate Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz, also introduced a decision in the Congress to release the Chinese government on it, release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to release the Nobel prize winner # LiuXiaobo unconditionally allowing it to go to a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">"" "the German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hoping that Liu" "" "gets all the medical support he needs" "" "and that a" "" "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing was Reuters, China had great concerns whether the vortex could be overthrown by Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China called on to provide an appropriate medical care for providing an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told him that Lius wife, Liu Xia, who could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not permitted to speak with someone outside, including his attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells you further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to address its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and those who are subject to the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested China in an explanation on 29 June, free of charge for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All the necessary actions need to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, which he needs, irrespective of where, and in addition, his wife and his family can contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news broadcaster France Info has already reported that the French government had welcomed Liu in the country, the Ministry of State announced that there is no further information, if France would eventually absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Festiting matters in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Liu and make a greater tolerance towards those that ask peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Party of Democratic Party demanded China too, allowing the sick intellectual Liu to leave himself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself greatly worried in a statement on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my belief that the initiatives, which he took, and for which he had been strictly penalised, had contributed to a harmonious, stable and wealthy families, which would have contributed to a peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and legal state in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may be stupid when Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark took a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting during a meeting of the international bigs of the State Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He underline that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to spin the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable land, we say that we were not to be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It was so vulgar, it had a flight to escape before the responsibilities, an obligation to breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what, he appeared insofar.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the main point of the Thas, the good old Leier came down from the authoritarian briers to be the stated Democrats, leaving the failure, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam, answers had been given to his American guests regarding our press, our Judicative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions cloaked with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our advertising K Shanmugam would take up the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high, to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog on the blog, it shows that it was to be able to read the full script of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "town" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unimportant, even if we are pleased to enjoy free and righteous elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He insisted Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that" "" "no land" "", "he obviously didn't recognize it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation, such as polemic testimony.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very close...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which awaits me - be I agreed with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt doubt and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, really associated with what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review sets the vulnerability of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam has committed an error, or was it a Freudger spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country will go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government officials, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the military service work its military service, but they do not defend its city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must withdraw our Prime Minister Invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Tense, the magazine Journey of a Decade for affirmation, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have received many of the most part...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "" "" "I can understand that we often hear that" "" "the defense of the country mainly" "", "but that's not quite true." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1738">Screenshot of a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked some of his editors: what is the most missable aspect of your home or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is applied to me in Japan is: "are you an American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry," "" "I'm sorry," "" "I'm coming from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Ever since the conversation takes place the conversation, it is regarded as polite to show interest in his talk partner by presenting personal issues.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification then the standard answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." a lot of Canadians may cook inside with anger, if they are kept for Americans, but me doesn't disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there are little that differs from Americans by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag at their backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American, however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small Ahornleaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender equality in Canada have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We are manifest very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also applies as the most tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First of all, I have many American friends that I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not make me anything, if you would change Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">By Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or by Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all: as "nice" to be referred to, is basically to be spicy - as the poor, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has an own Canadian double-stream).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people such as Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing at which you can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless, is unobtrusive and uninteresting and no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from things that happen around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire is to be free and only to be the main character of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "" "" "what more" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool courtesy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks a warm heart, open kindness, who meanwhile connected to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau turned the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada like sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous pop band has published a music video showing the Junta parodized, which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government in 2014, continues to revive the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video does not refer to the ongoing military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band has been invited by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was divided up to 1,254 times and received 8.800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin-Video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists to view the public, viewing this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, inspecial as it remains in the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the video which relate to some of the political themes, in Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which constitutes the commander of the captain of the host of absolute national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11 rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program to the "setting of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the Act on computer criminal, whose vage and unclear provisions are often used by the authorities to defile activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose a new unity was set up in the army, supervised by the online content and people who are accused of having defamed the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand relies a strike against "Lese Majeste" (Majesty of the Majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war broke out in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warn that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax exempts.</seg>

<seg id="1803">The following article, written by Dmitri Stateynov, first published on the website of OC Media, published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1804">The post-war company recovers very slowly in East-AbchAsia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has passed over 20 years now, since the Georgian-abian war officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern part of Tkuarchal show distinctive images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are in the carbon basin of AbchAsia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, amortization, Georgier and Armenians lived and worked in the area in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the biggest part of Russians and Abnies live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">These settlements are also called violin cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10.000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in these vultures.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district of 16.000 people had barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s, which are called Chruchakkowkas, is a symbolic for the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1830">Now there are only paved road with faded splendor-buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">People who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union, have meanwhile deserted the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town Dzhantukha live approximately fifty inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>

<seg id="1842">It is difficult to come about the rounds.</seg>

<seg id="1849">Galina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insisted that she supports her young grandson instead.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants attempting Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town Tapachula, he is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very easy hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican Mexican, a small woman with a corals pink base frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name of Mum Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is weakened by the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) became a target for Africans and Haitian who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars per night, guests can sleep in simple rooms, grinding, round, walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haiticultural immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, his wife told RamÃ­rez, the people come to a full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside of cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would like to refuse to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massaged them with a balm that exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived at a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama is an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yogurt) pounded to ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answered with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hopes to get to Boston to get there her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some African people who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then go toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other trails of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel the route together and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp from Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his pioneers has lived in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest since months ago in Mom Africa: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he got in contact with Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we never let it go again." "" "we will always be in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez told that their guests are often sending text message when they go, to grit them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have contributed to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only sparks hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valencia.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenciela and his family included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is Policit and has established that Busters will be sold to numerous african migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenciela declared that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was named after a raid on his work from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to save money from him without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an Unknown, an Allende, has offered him roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still there and tried to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, the travellers rely on their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus arrived today and has 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems to be happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">She laughs like a proud grandmother in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair stains, who gave her a spine, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she briefly presented her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have been continued."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Please send a check-point for personal communication tools in Xinjiang of Twitter users to the level of countries.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in the west of China, are forced to install a Spyware to their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users received a mobile notification in Tianshan district of Urumqi, in which it shows the District government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "should have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities are able to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app, had replaced messages with a private poker chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app wants to determine the sources and the distribution paths of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a service provider with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phasing pages to make users attentive to you how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "Remote controlled" state actors or even hacker might be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction stands in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities arrange often extreme censers and monitoring measures, as well as routinely internet-off.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media Outlet "images from Mainland China" (to which, in accordance with this effect, published photos by a checkpoint, on the policemen the inhabitants had already checked, they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian represent sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity due to public growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back again in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (which is to that which is in comparison), published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift the password requirements for a Windows operating system and therefore unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang on electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council that minimize distribution of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government officials, authorities and the party, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication tools.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report by Freedom House, an US-American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, an ordinance for all residents and entrepreneurs, until 1 August, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable disks, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police station.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. this promotion does not violate the privacy rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offences, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rape Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">This photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the majority of its time inside; sometimes, he snapped up to his screen, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can leave, however, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotintreated lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house that has since been heard in 1967; the year where Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and the family of Hdaibs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where she lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionful activist who oppose the conservative majority and posthumously their altreproven opinions about gender rollers, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and raping.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which deals often with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian cultures, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all of these issues do not only find in its home town of Amman, but also in cities that followed from Damascus in Syria until all Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking, and he can suffer from his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he is not open to the US foreign policy, he lifteth a special disclosure against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib viewed his art in Amman in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believe not that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, anything that was born with his identity as "Palestinian who was born in Jordan even though he was born in Jordan and never before had never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that" as I am a man, "while living in water dissolved nest cafÃ© in two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is foreseen for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib had a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot junked day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the cheek speak of a warm coffee and the vaim of the Kent cigarette in the nose to the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you throw a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From hence, it simply avoids to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordanian had cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians support the Islamic Emirate of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed Sinno, argued that the sexual orientation of the country is opposed to the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the deputies and former Pressesprecherin the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, which provides the approved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be siletorize, but in fact a clear reality reflected in the crystalline reality reflected in Hdaibs's work is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib established traditional gender norms by moving his vision from the fate of Arabic women who have voiced sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of obviously intoxated unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Honor' of 'Honor' - the inunofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch: according to Human Rights Watch the number of Honor in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan is still missing that Jordan has become an institutional infrastructure to support women, victims attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for brebreviation from 1954, women who are exposed to risk of family violence, "and for her release is often required for a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family that the woman is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music is very popular and is well-known for it, not to recite the topics that are long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denied that his work is political, however, is a fact that he can not separate his music, full of unlicensed approaches to sexuality, freedom and opinion of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">Politics was inscribed to me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" Ghareeb "" "" the focus is on poverty. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically involved in the nucleus can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get in his words, "what you want" - whether faith or non-faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and reading, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogramme Roya to be sure that his comments were torn out of the context, and in his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a modified version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuality does not apply to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">It mentions Abu Nuclear, a poet of the eighth century, which still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuclear, who should work later on behalf of the Caliph, could be open to homosexuality in the eighth century, why is it not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila, or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian Kingdom, there is nothing new anymore that the government chests attacks on the free expression and that progressive votes will be transferred to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service ordered several ex-government members and members of the teacher's association with the grounds that they had criticiously critically criticised the problems in social media, linked to corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to counteract a structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is an independent and take-off. Jordan has held a show for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, reasoned and inhumane changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib died, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dreams for his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be informed by means of music, art and literature of a real and basic offence - and not through bombs, streetunitions and on artificial art. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as far as it is, Hdaib will continue to continue and also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant warriors are as fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories with regard to the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forces, the drums and dancing more than one thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2157">I've been looking forward to Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two cars are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only feeling - and in this way, to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were external appearance and body care as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from the crime and encourage a legitimate profession as the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road smob and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A poll published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore the fallen hairdressers of famous sports artists such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), has led to the experienced hands of hairhairdressers who can form these hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairdressers who go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity has even an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts come to each other in order to show that one can create the most excentric Looks, as can be seen in the following video (additional videos to current competitions there are at the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people against hairstyle tools and instead of bad advice to obtain a training in hairstyle art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities, dozens of young people saw that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March, and reported about some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud, because of love with the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "Liebesambitions to guerrilla fighters," published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel stretched out, affection affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios, from the head and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (Letters to Reconciliation), and to write young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombian), which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">At the same time the signposted to peace treaty was so significant that President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits in the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombian, there is still a long way until you can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and carried out their weapons with their weapons, to integrate them back into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which was accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for guerrilla fighters, now you have to record them into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian has to close together and would have to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did, until now, thousands of young people already wrote letters - love letters to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters - which are to be delivered personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was held at the World Summit of Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in BogotÃ¡. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk short with Kailash Satyumi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people who love Him, Valentine's Day of thousands of love letters, but those who need to make them much more constrained.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he continued reading this year to share his love with people who needed the most urgent effects.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which now need to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were transferred to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March in one of the UN camps.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled to the camp to personally overtake the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves on how they used it earlier to meet the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they have not received orders, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings may pass through in just a few hours - from anxiety to luck and everything that is in between" says the policy scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I saw in one of the" "" "Camcode" "" "(a kind of cottage in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go into, because beside him on the bed a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the bush.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him," "" "hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone has written me something like a nice, so do I answer it. "then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I completely embraced him and put me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was sorry for war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life to war. the FARC was the only way to keep it and his six brothers before the starvation. "I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society that is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Starting the start, students and some of the FARC came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all growing up as already war and the FARC already had already been in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, their ideals and made insight into their views over the peace process: "for many years we have experienced the opportunity to develop us to develop a political party, we can help us to develop the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this size order, it's worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people, who had never found their hearing and had no election right, and to recognize that the people who have often had seen monsters, and even people who have turned their environment through their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed, and have caused much harm to give us a smile and a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been made, that it would rule peace according to the disarmament of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest against their rights. and that's also quite justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now rely on the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion, or ideology of them belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2256">One day was told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who stuck in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he was a friend of my documents, and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechnya friends, with the following message: "then there is no men any more in Chechnya who can eliminate these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made by the whole Whatsapp go round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just going to bring some shopping stakes from the backseat of my car, I heard a mascot saying: "here is a gift for you of your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned myself, I felt somewhat in my body, but I did not hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I listened to a set, but this time in Chechnya: "how long will you like the family still, you cry?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last dudes in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women got together and started to shout.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had taken two samples in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurses were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, since then my male name stands on; but the doctor stood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it to do with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he is still respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The desired to send me to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it, by breaking up without the streets; others wanted to stop that I had not changed my sex in the official television station in Grozny, and I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how does your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic has been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much, and she put a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to a flat and already a few hours later there was a car with darkened window discs and a number plate with a number of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it was clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the numbering of the numbering - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give her name, but I want to remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mom once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought her without a record, without identification, without any identification.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you believe not about, you warmer in security, only because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you are using. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not speak about the sexually assumptions, this is a table of tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still bear some of the Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish it, this spiritual barrier may not be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really give myself trouble as the person remembering it from their past - so remember my male shape.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What to do your friends, those who have stayed with?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I took more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who has left one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "in order to do so, they probably recharge the relatives, these care about the problem with the affected person and in the end ask proof that the so-called" honour "through blood genius has experienced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even pregnant women recorded in these insists?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine, there wouldn't be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And when, above all those who have no rich relatives or those who have dropped from their relatives, were able to set up cadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there, so that you can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they were killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they would have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, but dipped specifically to radialize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a failure, or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote someone who had been detained in Argun a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was, when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they were not presented as a band, but there were no reports until now. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed it to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and performances of people who have a so-called "non-traditional" orientation belong already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I believe already before 2003 I was already known as Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to lead us to the" "" "Civilization" "", "but ultimately prevented us back in the stone days." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had coloured lashes, wore RÃ¶hrenjeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the Sharia law has never used to me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and all the city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redempse: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when most of them are fun.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so did they just shut up their eyes before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never chased and never beaten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace time kept?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk on television via Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people of the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had raged before, and laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity is going to go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't deserve much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I'm still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gathering, I start to get them to the hospital and help them to get tensing cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I lost no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves, when I feel refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear any Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is aleditors.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens which prophesies with foam in front of the mouth that there is no threshold.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which the Cabardiner have who, the Russians have also what; on the planet it gives them - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transidentations of men, the men love, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truce.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensations to be exact, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and will not be ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I am personally born here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of suicide within the arming Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months, there is a strong increase in self-moring.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on the 27th of August, the desperated situation of the Arab Ahwazi Community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression and he was ashamed for his own helplessness to come up for his family, such as Ahwazi human rights groups who want to stay in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One on YouTube divided video, the moments after he had set himself on YouTube, was fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to erase the flames back, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incinerators were so strong that doctors could not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that was exited in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in front of that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - hamid manipulate, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Moussawi and Shaam Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: all family fathers, who were forced to work on the persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to work their families and to work for a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which most of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to denounce its living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and in 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the biggest in Iran ahead of oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable useful areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continued to grow slowly, and the indigenous population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabians in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and ghom are surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation in the region of drought, and local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab disease wzi-adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperating, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who is looking for a job, finished in primary school, 55% completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and rassistant ethical discrimination, leads to a" high rise "of self-moring among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse than it has been worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic origin and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions do not prefer the Arab work force, the local Arab Ahwazi will entail access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab and to force her living being outside of their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre- and surnames to hide their consent to the Ahwazi and so-called Arab names on the workplace are not tolerated, soften as the speaking of Arabic language or the tragedy of Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, the Arab Ahwazi need to beat human rights activists, before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treated and committed suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the review that was posted by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrfÃ©minas website. the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women react, especially white women, who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are surprised, why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even do well-thought scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women in spite of the same education still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, if it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still ensuring that women earlier, or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination on the sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it, and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I arrive on the skin colour, on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention, on which type we have physically and banned both in and outside of feminist movement, many of the white feminists and white intersectional feminists have to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, all agree that women - all women - to come together in order to raise "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing, to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutional form of assimilated violence that we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about the fact that black women and women, and women, and women, make less deserved than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often the school are referred to as white girls, because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black sphmen and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all human rights have any skin colour of the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join the black woman as a black woman who refuses to take into account the unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which relate to both the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and I won't fight any more my consent in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that always denied me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complain in 1851 in her speech:" "" "I am not a wife?" "" "and I also refuses to justify a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised beings." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I sofar me to join groupings, which also absorb our customs of customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to get the importance of white women's importance of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honour one of the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was founded to give women of different interests and to abolish themselves from white Feminism, is still the word "Feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">"" "" "" "I'm going to join me full of feminism and join me the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that interpreter is celebrated as a novel phenomenon." ""</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define the black women on our own ideas and join us into the spheres that are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenormous a Hudson line, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclainism. (about: Africa-Womanism) speaks of what we can defend ourselves, in which they are fully safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists instantly call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, please tell you about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in a environment in which my life is neither translated, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">In the past 7 years, Nabil Musa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. its mission aims to deliberate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river, which we lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust explosion, pollution and controlled development, lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of Waterpp Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who has relied and works in order to protect the rivers, streams and water routes in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarises the vibration and importance of his work in a question: "if we don't have any water more, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced and filmed for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedial journalist, in Erbil, Iraq, in Erbil.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and modified version of the article "The wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" of currant. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraubin), which was reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police Commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her husband partner who had become non-violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship has been a bit of time and the police said, their statement would be laid to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further woman Balbuena was showed for mistreatment, also the actenderly display of Ada BÃ¡ez was not useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The devil's vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women have to report at all once, they do not receive any support on the part of the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who are mistreated. this also explains why only 20% of women who admit victims of violence to be victims of the prosecution authorities in all cases.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Intra1 beats and statitic 2 unvisible mistreatment and a legal system that nothing undernimm3 of Paraguay's laws: good approach, faulty implementation beats and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It's hard to say how many women really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for Gendernal research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports, but not even ansata, the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains it.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General Public Prosecutor dropped 9600 ads due to domestic violence. 70% of them went on violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads added to the police were women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads caused by domestic violence in the Nobel Peace Treaty. 86% of the total ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically harassed, 55% of the women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are actually shown. "on every woman who has been paid in Paraguay because of psychological Missing message, 9 women will not do that.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "every woman who has been reimbursed due to physical mistrel ad, comes two women who do not do that" "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's suicide in Paraguay can not be adequately documented, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days, a woman due to violence committed by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Unvisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not take anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the solid friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that they named him the names of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do it, but she was still going to regret. this should always regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. but for two years she bore psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizing the most difficult ones:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have victims of mistreatment once.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read about it earlier, I thought that only women are happening to submitting them because they are discouraged by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that never would happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, among them also Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric, if he had lifted up the hand against them and refused to be able that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen this as long as Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment should have at least a certain schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had mistreated them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network ("I believe") that consists of women, all of which are victims of mistreatment in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological mistrel.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that they were worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads in the authorities remained without the result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partners, which developed into an unobliterable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, where it was mainly used by money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Uruguay laws: good approach, faulty implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of mistreatment is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in the justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, in the paraguayan Parliament, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks to explain Femizid to a peculiar offenders and tougher how it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the Legislative text was changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law, that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is forbidden, which are currently forbidden in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">"" "" "" "the original draft law had intended to bear the majority of the bureaucratic and economic) of the process which currently must contribute to the victims of violence against itself, if they are simply reimbursed and receive a secure accommodation to raise the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means at the disposal:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay Missing is seen as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must be held so that violence is no longer considered a slightly Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silence in view of these facts, is found guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to report as long indication until mistreatation is no more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act was adopted in the paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed. in this case, a passage has been cancelled, which had been calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was closed due to the decision of the Ministry of Information" on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of its coverage about corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he served one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaha Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before Court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had appointed his father, Said Ibn Taimur, by a state of Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Rule of the Sultans is characterized by the harshal efforts of security forces, in particular by domestic intelligence, public freedom, including press freedom, responsibility and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger, and further activists, inviolate and incarcerate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically enforcing and hindering citizens, even activists, to their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the invasion of three of her editors last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported in Oman since its foundation in 2007 in Oman (absolute monarchy) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, who had appeared in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, was published an article with the title "High-related parties" hands of justice. "it was corruption in Justizwesen and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS received the Deputy editor of Yousef Al-Haj, who had been invited to be Chief Editor after Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed at an indefinite period after the Ministry of Information had given the order that "the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way, including online, will be prohibited from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial in Maskat took place in the trial of the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted among others because of the disruption of public order, "misuse of the Internet" and "signatures of the State of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found in addition to the violation of a publication and defamation for slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj had been sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year vocational ban was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after having the use of "an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">On 22 August 2016 Al-Abri was granted a security deposit of 5,000 (13 000 US dollars) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016 Al-Abri was sentenced to six months in prison on 26 December 2016, sentenced to Al-Haj on a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was freed from the prison prison in Masking at the prison on 10 April 2017. al-Haj continues to be in prison, where he served his twenty-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also decided to close the decision of the Ministry of Information on the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court, Azamn again, the newspaper sees itself as an attack by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Ministry of Information sent a statement with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and the Minister concluded a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court to redefine the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been injured in Oman at most recent time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and exercising pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, will stop their operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive infringement of the Press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the Japanese authorities to:</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, image takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need to be used on site. there are many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries of Africa have far more serious consequences than elsewhere, and missing investment for exploring these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research that is carried out by African scientists will only be eligible for establishing own research capacities in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be eligible for economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warriors is Director of the centralabors at the centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">It grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious consequences for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he worked on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and over misunderstanding of the media via this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warriors speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I underline the samic national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lab tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition I started developing a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important recent research topics in your country and universally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">It needs to change that, otherwise, we will always be able to remain instead of himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find the suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw back here, as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous power supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it will take months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interesting, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">"" "" "" "I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion after the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are a limited speed, things to do, and the scarious access to scientific expertise that represent the challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), is also limited to the amount of existing information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: such as "Open Source" seed producers make the global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published at Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been supporting salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its enterprise offers 114 varieties, such as Outredhat, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">It was only almost 20 years old, Mortons work only through its own imagination and the question how many salads can get it limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more salads were patented and that he couldn't continue to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only available for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance levels compared to diseases, a special rotor or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more of such patents have been applied to more plants such as grain or cardboard locations. due to these trends, plant operators, environmentalists and experts provide food safety in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton requires a salad but still needs longer since its work is getting more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, when in a river a rock broods that I must have left." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do that now, but it is a split with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go to salt.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stop before judgment, no one can chastise any new salts because all the features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to get those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In doing so, however, it is very careful and endeavoured to use not material that is protected as a spiritual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It also has a movement that is connected to the United States and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronaut of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman salat the variety Outredth in the "greenhouse" of the station and ate. there is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that, then the movement from the IT sector would come and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for Open Source "seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life in order to ensure that some plant species and inhabitants are not protected as a spiritual property and can be used permanently for plantations.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can agree that others are able to freely use them from farmed seed.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others to buy their seed, it is not immediate hies - two aspects which are forbidden by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dinning outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the retired professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Cleppenburg are control over the seed and the possibility of developing new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger combinations such as BiodiversitÃ¤t, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to use the latter not or just a little by taking seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Cloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not that, from ecological agriculture, and Monsanto and Bayer. "those who are happy to buy locally and sustainably producing vegetables, such as such as farmers, should also know the manner that the species is bred, like this vegetable is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to make others free of charge. in contrast, their anticipation is to be patented in contrast, seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporter arguing that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available genpool is due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always restricted to unbreakable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has been employed in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all boxes are protected as a spiritual property, which means that it is unusable for plant breeding either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby discouraged that massaging plants are patented like wheat in even larger style, as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they feature targeted features - of such as their taste or their color improves up to such as they flourish in certain environments as well as pain or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is due to more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more powerful than ever before, because the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail you will recognize Monsanto-Specherin Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company uses the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the fact that spiritually ownership other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant variations promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often this instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection does not inhibit innovations, but it promotes it to be provided with the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent is made, and will certainly be no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long on plants, which are adapted to plants that are adapted to the changed environment conditions, the struggle would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is however, that genetic resources have always been a general good thing and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeding neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it's impossible to use us if we don't continue to use the best and the latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton does not disturb itself at the concept of itself, plant features: "we do not really create the features itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants produce them, and as breeder, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant of plant in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever denounces a sort, denounces his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in the industrial farming with large courts and monocultures may be needed for their cultivation of herbicides that is specialized in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very good. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either refuse it to be expensive and therefore not worthwhile, or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden Salates.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also aware that breeder would be innovative by the Avoid of plant patrons: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new things more than companies that patented more than companies.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the 5th Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue working on the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The same network for Human Rights Information Dogs in spite of this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution, though it was never so difficult to defend this targets as well. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities should be exhausted to overcome the lockout and do not return. we hope to fulfill our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic language issue of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization on wave of web pages has fallen victim to victims. @ anhri is one of the principal sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnists and human rights researching Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spreading of Kolumnen and articles, which he does not have to include local websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up in order to deal with the appeal of the Egyptian government, was the goal of a attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider is home to Canada's blog, on the other hand is accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after having been arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protest and taken a video as the police pursued physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles will turn mainly to politics and human rights issues in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook review, Ziada expressed himself to the lock by the government and reflecting what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is succeeded to mediate me the feeling of a siege; a arrest, attempted murder, preloading during the National Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I'd like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I took it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have locked it, and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian officials from 24 May to 06 August 133 pages. this produced technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE, also documented the blocking of providers by using Internet search and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June we noticed how the lock of Web sites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice attests to the intention of the government to block content and filtering on the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally changed in addition to the doors being made behind the doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis in which they can proceed in court against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day by day, newspapers in all Brazil will report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot at school," "" "every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro were murdered," "" "thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, navy and air dolee to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a clamped financial situation the violence shaft in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are single daily and this is inacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "thus published the detailed reporting on violence in Rio-known newspaper" Extra "on August 16," "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to establish a new section called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The following motives for their decision declared the paper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city in the world as murder, robbery, sexual violence, and all that happens only in Rio, is published in the section "war in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to conclude that as journalists don't close our eyes in front of the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video which was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war of war in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 areas, there will be controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial writing, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We know that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used, grameless of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "war" more than it is used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the News portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued to describe violence as "war." this is their opinion after a justification of failed security policy by the media and might make it difficult to express responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and an historical and self-pleasing neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2781">The establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the state of Rio in 2003, belonged to the establishment of a massive police station to conquer a Favela, and permanently stationed a unity.</seg>
<seg id="2782">At the beginning this was actually to be a decline of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP had to protect against several reports about chaianas and repressions against the poor communities that actually had to protect the newly created police unit increasingly.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use means of resources and ways which are typical for a war. this is a penetrating point in the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and to the object for "Collateral Damage" and "mistaken balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas will continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week, it is now that the police reignited the mountain by Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policemen.</seg>

<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say that time, she knew that she would not see her son very long, - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">The boy should break up in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring it to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara dominated Party Hezb-e-Wahdat had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many hazara felt suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">Those who were for their hatred for the Hazara did always come closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohornet. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were harder than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were minted from misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Aharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site at which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon before the open window, so we don't moors at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Aharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to the needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Indeed, Italy is true that Italy is a great chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high inflation rates. however, it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers are disastrous in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization of Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of the asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 "special training centers" in the hands of improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to an acceptance centre if they have officially placed an application for asylum - which can take place for months after the registration of the asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money to have an accommodation either on the hospitality of friends, or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also aiaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his vital life helped Aharaf to free from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf formed his entire savings in Venice's establishment in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while, he opened a second hostel, and opened a sellipse.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Amir Baratis Success Story is now theme of the documentary "Disd Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which has already been presented for the 24th time.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - mainly for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghanistan operated companies, including guardian, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience, where the winery and the kitchen staff members are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is narrated by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts, the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also an Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Agathafs aims to go far beyond the Italian gastronomic business and retailers back to the country that he had to leave cibly as teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are possibilities," "" "said Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my land and I can not live happy when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of the company and must get the same possibilities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Adenaf denotes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preserving technologies." "" "they can sell their seriousness on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but at the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this trip itself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this way.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netices Report is an international snapshot, the challenges, victories, and upcoming trends in the world's website</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament is checked in a draft law, which proposes that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to use to use social networks within six months after the submission of the legislative decision on the website of the authority, stating their complete name and their registration number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the Entribution of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently subject to legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, a further member of the Chamber of Deputies would be to be introduced in which tougher penalties would be introduced for the indemnity of the President or a high civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the Egyptian law, the insult of the President as well as state institutions may already be punishable. however, under the Legislative Decree, such a matter would act with prison and monetary policy, right-wing experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be adopted, this may mean up to three years in prison for the convictions.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would be a political climate, in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo Zid (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took on violence against protesters that demonstrated violence against the military coup that led to the official President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protestants who had been arrested during the same incident, four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his trial was postponed to the 20th May, because the prison derivative according to human rights groups failed to bring the defendants from prison in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, headburden from among others ceasefire, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza said the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage for pro-Morsi seat blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also detained at the previously mentioned fall, aged 25 years to 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was interrogated mainly to a sealed action plan, which was expressly backed by the President of the Republic, the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, if they restore all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat, presents a light on how the presidials will look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the separation of his sources in accordance with Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Centre, which guarantees the right to protect their sources on the protection of their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Despite this, he joined the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Wants to force the user of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the Information Management Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media need a permit to write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In terms of requirements, the registration will be necessary with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analytics showed that through the elimination of anonymous comments on social networks can be reached within social networks. it is now unclear as the authorities shall apply these regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2957">Then we'll see you in "WeChat"?</seg>

<seg id="2961">This name is part of a law dating back to 2014, thanks to which the Russian government organizes a list of information. "the law also permits the government to make it responsible for removing content and force them on request for compensation of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages are currently using websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoclassic niki (Russia two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
