this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he wrote spectacular that the N@@ SA had been illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
but it is another chapter , that should leave a lasting impression .
it describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c US intelligence service in which the CIA handed down literally designs for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter did not like this ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this move , he was to condemn the symbol for the design of the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower followers and to defeat journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Council , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ age@@ ous ones they give .
so when the government drew near R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen also lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something has happened .
suddenly , although they were for years of age , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to R@@ isen .
reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and springs can always be hidden .
instead of fail@@ ing and ride to the statements , they could also do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so the investig@@ ator , without its consent , wor@@ ried up his tel@@ eph@@ onn@@ Ã© ,
just like its e @-@ mail , financial and banana information , its credit card , and even travel speed with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ leb@@ one and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , that is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised his attraction to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower followers . but instead , justice condemned him more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is involved too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of it that a sin@@ hist@@ leb@@ one went into a journalist .
thus , we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more possibilities to send them all out .
but as the technology of the government allows to handle the rights of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can contact that from the moment they get in contact , instead of the hin@@ der , in the stuff .
today there is communication software that had not yet been writing as R@@ isen his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is a Secure@@ Drop , an open source basis system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s history , which was developed by us by Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I work , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents as with any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and saved on a server , to which only the respective News Agency has access .
so the government can no longer create information secretly , and many of the information that would request it would not be available from pre @-@ outset .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the Press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments in all the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that are all endangered .
it is to be sure that not only technology denomin@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to make abuse of abuse . it is exactly the same that we protect the next honey@@ comb
the above abuse of the supply of soldiers did know and will report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environment @-@ workers , the alarm to the contamin@@ ated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ paper In@@ sider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our of the constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data collection of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous money sum@@ s ) &#91; is &#93; hidden by Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents based in Panama &apos;s resident law firm Mos@@ qu@@ ay Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of the tax @-@ rab@@ bits .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has come back .
there are reports that a bund@@ led by the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad spoke mail @-@ based companies in control rab@@ bits .
it is claimed that a footprint of 2 billion US dollars came to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , a narrow friend from children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and to the next reveal documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency owner , or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems weeping from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax @-@ phases and not all its taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing the media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens from a few minutes to hide and conce@@ aled your fortune - something that we have been discussing and un@@ veil since ten years .
I think many people appears this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how these hel@@ o@@ ases work .
I always make it to me like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ o .
so one company has a company in another company , in a further company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably , because there have been no prominent Americans , those who came in these revel@@ ations in this sc@@ andal .
well , it is not so that there is no rich American who hide her fortune in tax rab@@ bits .
but by principle , after which these hel@@ o@@ ases work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data transfer from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is so that one needs fewer information in some U.S. states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library reference ID .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees to zo@@ res school children .
it is permitted to zoom on any vulner@@ ability .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so , we sent a hidden examination to the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked to us that everyone else could put on a lawyer to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ pre@@ sidents . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted our secret investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax cur@@ ses , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
this may sound very violent , as if we could not do anything against it , if nothing ever changed , if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen pre@@ aches to more transparency what the owners concerns firms .
the subject was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind firms in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ators , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of the control rab@@ bit , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy , who rise up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use themselves to end through the laws of this type of transparent .
together , we can finally terminate the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax cur@@ ses , corruption and money la@@ under@@ wear .
this is the story , just as I ab@@ duc@@ ted almost , and in the caffeine room of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained , and looked my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through all the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you asleep here tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I &apos;ve just got to know it yet ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to go away in the boot space of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small caffeine room !
then I heard of saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I fro@@ ze on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh dear ! what have I broken up ?
a wild bo@@ b@@ bed in my living room .
what if it is crazy ? &quot;
I was afraid that I climbed up out of the bed , on the to@@ e peaks at the door , and closed my sleeping room .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the work of art , which he had bought from me , is now on his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends who were only waiting for it to be discovered ?
people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us make a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that at the time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I believe , creativity can create it , be troubled in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ om@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have transgres@@ sed how we could earn something . our apartment is equipped with a designer bed and breakfast @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on the air fro@@ ze on wood floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to decorate our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ts completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we went to our last guest and got the door to the castle , Brian and I started to start .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and to pay our rent ?
things came to roles .
my former ro@@ om@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we would like to create a web site on which people publicly posts from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are going over .
on the Internet , they can then invite the wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missile would burn .
but they did not put it .
no one who is still with comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned as children , strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one gets to things that can be good . we were able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create new trust by design , between people who never met before .
can design make a little bit ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a cost sample , which degree of confidence we moved .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked cell phone your left seat .
this quiet attacks of panic , which you will feel right -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when it open the door .
for the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who has actually got Al Go@@ res cell phone now ?
could you announce on Twitter , that he is the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had introduced only once with his name , if he had told how he does , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you had 150 attractions , who say all : &quot; he can really hold fast mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you need to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to give negative consequences .
finally , we decided to wait until both the host and guest releases were released , before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to the age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social de@@ pressed .
it is exciting if you add to the call of a person - in our case by appointment .
if you have less than three departments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation down simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep sp@@ ies .
Moreover , we discovered that trust is dependent on how much people are in price .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell little about how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get any answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is therefore an optimal degree of off@@ ence , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ ler works in your flat ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design , to make this degree an off@@ ence ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which topics should be written .
our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces over strangers .
by which we were not counting , the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are also times if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are not allowed parties to celebrate or have ruined homes .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing more lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it &apos;s hurt when I think only remember .
the dis@@ appointment , which one hears in the voice of An@@ ru@@ de , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , of the 123 million overnight stays there was only a fraction of a problem .
for people trust one another .
when it works trust , marvel@@ ous works can be created .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to take heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives , even though they do not know any thing .
you drive one in your own car at the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books past .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course not running every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled up for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of particle work together with monetary transactions ?
it is a economic trading here .
but it &apos;s just a &quot; rental industry &quot; to call , the thing is not just .
share Economy describes a trade , the human relationships promises .
people lay a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
if one travels today , it is possible to compare fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , however , when travelling a vast buffet of local in@@ hi@@ bit ?
what if at every place you visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a group there , and to show one of the pubs in a pub , of which one has never heard ;
or if you want to cook a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to create apartments of reason to shared one ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have shared the idea of common share ?
I imagine the cities which enable us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ tization .
in South Korean capital , this project had already begun . many parking places that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a lead , were offered .
have been conve@@ yed to people whose children were moved . the incubation programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share of economy . over our platform 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries alone will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems not to be so crazy , as it was taught .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there was even before .
there were some similar websites before us .
so why does our work just work ?
apart from fortun@@ ate and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ root advantages .
I find it in blo@@ om ,
down@@ turn too overwhelming .
I have to think about that when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
of course , we know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a faithful ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ pressing a bra@@ p@@ ist , a terror ist ?
or simply a delay while security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the bl@@ ame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent what I like .
a study revealed that 80 % of coverage about Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ash@@ eg@@ rowing fitness fan@@ atic in ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as hom@@ osexual men , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot;
the funny one was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and from the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and perfect beauty deal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have to do with the cor@@ an .
I read it , I thought that he was doub@@ ted and eventually thought .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow de@@ vot@@ ion that deep@@ en himself with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k will sometimes bring me to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone wanted you to perceive , that she under@@ stands , and somehow she loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian &quot; American Dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , sat down at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Express &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ ig@@ sa@@ ws from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock changed rapidly into indignation .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country , but in the N@@ u transformed me the acts of others by a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East to go to a new city and to begin with the advanced studies .
I remember how I left -- as we went silent - so deep it went in my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , when I heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations , they said , &quot; Be careful , &quot; Ab@@ ide in well lit areas , &quot; says you not . &quot;
I stayed all the week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to the B@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again loud the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw me the extensive reporting .
the feelings were of understanding , and I heard also of attacks on Muslims , or of men who died for Muslims , in the free time .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ ces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have thrown the rage of the people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain to itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the alle@@ g@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to for@@ ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like from a tumour in the body of the USA .
it &apos;s only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or bad ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour are being removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all the Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but an important organ .
thank you !
Muslims are Invent@@ ors and Te@@ ach@@ ers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olymp@@ ias .
will the closing of mos@@ ques in America will make a safer place ?
perhaps a few parking is free , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of faith toler@@ ant , and greater public participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington region , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ c@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ c@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
at the radi@@ alisation process , it is found that it is possible to start from their own assembly , even from their family , so that the person believes that the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itors or ab@@ h@@ ed by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ alisation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
after all , a group like the IS proves its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as Muslims , as a mother , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to the world , if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , it does not drives what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the Scri@@ ptures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because they have prepared to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she spoke , brought them to silence , and told her that their anger , its sense for in@@ justice in the world , she would only bring in trouble .
nothing inspired by nothing and something that was given to their anger , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts who gave her a solution .
this I@@ mam introduced the connection to God and its church .
instead of accused them for their anger , he showed her structive way for a real change in the world .
what she met in the mosque , she kept it before joining the IS .
that was a gli@@ mp@@ se of how the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear of every day affect our democracy and freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we rather accept a author@@ itarian government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one reported ass@@ als messages in which neg@@ ativity was reported , they voted rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
that is not just an academic problem .
when you look at when the mood against Muslims were shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this was three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the war of Iraq , and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terrorism , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , in order to expand the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and informative citizens .
how to deal with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as first , but the toxic air of fear terri@@ fy us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not only to explain himself to themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the most generous , most generous people whom they knew .
she visited him there , and he showed her CV . she was stub@@ born and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is it a young man having become a young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne during her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon . he did it in her flat as in an execution after he posted external attacks on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be un@@ mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the Mos@@ que or stayed safely at home ?
we contempl@@ ate it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was why we want to leave to our children : one that would control ourselves through fear , or one in whom we can exercise our religion free .
we decided to the mosque .
with our son in the nur@@ sery , we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw he had sent me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked , and called our guests welcome , because the half of the Jews were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack ourselves , but to be par@@ tak@@ ers of us .
in that moment , I am collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion in panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what are you going to vote in the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan ?
will you be sure to go on number ?
or are you connected to those that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks well !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I ask myself what you say that you may claim that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a monument with deep thinking , such an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t forget . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as it is permitted .
when people look on the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on the whole world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in no respect .
if people appear as a rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
as a platform for Bast@@ ers started , a billi@@ on@@ aire is standing shortly before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ et de@@ position into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they started flying with ropes .
connected by connecting connections high speed and acceleration in the highest space .
they can also build independently able structures .
they have learned to carry loads to carry loads to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today , we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the Pos@@ sible in the autonomous area .
to make a system autonomous , it has to know collective con@@ dol@@ ences , where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic applications .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board , what the machine should do .
external commands are available in the highest layer . e.g. , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flying with a fla@@ p .
like other starters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most strong whis@@ kers , it can h@@ over and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a revers@@ al page .
a restriction of the tail@@ or is that it is sensitive to tur@@ mo@@ il as wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position can be recovered and improves the performance through practice .
okay .
during our research , we often have basic abstract questions about the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known to be known as machines with a thousand moving parts that dev@@ ote himself to hurt you .
more than decades ago , pilots of remote control units were flying , which had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ ster .
un@@ long ago , we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner that served mechan@@ ically , served air@@ brush . it was invented in short @-@ time .
it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ auses , hing@@ es and cross @-@ edge , no further pitch or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the inner life a lot happens so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ ms of the tail . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it right correctly .
the probability to throw it right , if everyone is sure , is low , therefore I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ ess cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this in@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is living in his direction .
as a result , he will receive the au@@ sterity skill ,
in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction he rot@@ ated , or even as he rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be found in models , the rest will be lear@@ ns directly to fly .
let &apos;s look at that .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate ru@@ dder prop@@ eller machines .
this turns in clock@@ wise direction
and the other on the clock@@ wise direction .
when one builds them , they be@@ have like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls from , the electronics or a battery -- can the machine fly further , even when restricted .
we will now demonstrate that to make half an air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully motiv@@ ating these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine because on Broadway you would like to take a flyer lamp on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in the development and the Schaff@@ ens@@ act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and charming is our universe , and that it allows creative , clu@@ stering so@@ cks to form them in so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive and economical potential , the bag pointed is on the i .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , there traveled two black holes in a very far away galaxy . they walked so far the mass of three s@@ men in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy .
this short moment , shining bright as all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known universe .
it was a very great b@@ ye .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given in the space @-@ time ge@@ ared and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , a majority life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has resulted in a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand for us with -- even the internet .
some 25 years ago , a group decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are produced by colored black holes .
most held them for mad .
but enough people recognized them as a crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation was funded its idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ vent @-@ Observ@@ atory Observ@@ atory .
in the following time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly , what the detection performance improved enorm@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O now .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O started to clari@@ fy some smaller , hard @-@ ne@@ sting problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colored black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the leave of my to@@ d@@ dy Father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and its si@@ det@@ ain@@ ees as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cro@@ achment in the ge@@ ared of space and time .
when tigh@@ tening the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and to the other .
for illustration , lecturer in courses of the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a real ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; expand and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for instance , each of us extends on the waves of the waves , the expansion of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one explained the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser @-@ detector , and this is already absur@@ d , this length should be measured to less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us exactly . that is Gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are mighty .
but physi@@ cists are fin@@ ite and with the support of the public , all barriers will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott proves that L@@ IG@@ O was more an ear than one eye .
I want to explain what that means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ tions , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or map of things to perceive that you perceive by several points of light around you .
the sounds is different with tones .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult to produce an image of things that are particularly important to you :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind .
&quot; now just Alice &quot; speaks .
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ une Bob &quot; .
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them we can make no easy pictures of objects in all .
but as we pay attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O measured the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert wave pattern in Sh@@ all , we can hear the All literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott employed very long .
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cir@@ cl@@ ings simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , one hears the same pair of audio tracks with an extra sound change . that is what it sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu :
it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped into the shaft form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date which at least I &apos;ve never forgotten -- heard the noise of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass that will turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us know what that means .
two black holes , the di@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each other for a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
it consists of the lasting importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is a completely new way to explore the universe , as she was never before .
on this path we can listen to all listen and the invisible .
much in All we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- do not see .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ish stars will explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the All .
the exciting physical processes occur in the heart that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through because these op@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the primitive one would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own after@@ g@@ ings .
using Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimi@@ stic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen , and of which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by hearing .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the first race things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says on this topic : ME : the kind of stars that produce black holes as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to speak the suction bones for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to reveal another perspective on the events of all , in the emergence of the stars and finally , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be bold as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and the cat@@ er@@ pillars of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ ator@@ ia -- a whole new generation of observ@@ ator@@ ia on earth and in All .
for what could be better than to listen to the primitive man ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams you with us .
thanks .
before some time I tried an experiment .
one year long would I say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid .
no matter whether they made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes . &quot;
do I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to start with the scene ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes , yes .
and then a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear to keep spe@@ eches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed .
but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life to un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my smallest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett , and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls on all &quot; estim@@ ation , &quot;
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; I estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ asses . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was just in the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new living setting in my family . from there I swear to play always with them as soon as you call me to do . no matter what I am doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I do trouble me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a blo@@ o@@ unding side effect : only recently I understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things from you up@@ take you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I &apos;m pro@@ du@@ ous TV .
I make TVs , in large style .
in this TV season I am responsible for that 70 hours of program go out into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that are not exist before .
the budget for a episode of a TV set can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say 5 .
a new episode every nine days , four TV programs , four TV programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes , the same time in production , 16 episodes : Grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essi@@ vely on Thursday night .
around the world , my series run in 256 different languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is globally , and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are broadcasts that I created themselves , and not only produced so far . I have to find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who makes this yet ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you all of you who work so hard as you are looking for a company , a country or a class@@ room , so you understand that I &apos;m not just around your computer , and imagination , and it &apos;s right when I say : I understand that it is not dre@@ aming with a dream home .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the job , there is no other feeling .
my work creates a country out of nowhere .
it was when I set up troops on a canvas .
as a dream man you get a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ Ã© .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and dis@@ rup@@ tive , clin@@ ically and dis@@ rup@@ tive , clin@@ ically and rational , cruel and rational . and the best it is the sum of the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sum@@ s li@@ stens to a busy street , I could drive for ever on her .
many people assume , when I tell them the Sum@@ mon that I wrote letters , that the writing is preparing to me .
do not understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started to work with TV production , when I started working and work , build and assemble , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , you don &apos;t have to strive for a different size .
the feeling , not otherwise can be compared to the size , no matter what price does .
that is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe there is also a work@@ horse to be .
maybe it &apos;s gen@@ ius .
maybe it means E@@ go .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made of failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan I and I know that I want to question it in question .
to make a clear : ever more shipments , the more shipments , the more episodes , the more works there are , the more works at the same time , the more do I write history , even more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I need to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the great sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , out@@ dated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth , that their m@@ om is a single work title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om is not there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ ald says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
it &apos;s the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine was silent .
I no longer loved my work anymore . the engine was out of .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ day , continuous weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , don &apos;t cover a titanium , does not give up , with perfect heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun any more .
and that was my life .
all things I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sum@@ s I was .
so what makes one doing so when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you , the author of the author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you are doing , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother who knows when you know the sum@@ s , and knows how the sum@@ s really know when the sum@@ s stopped , who is then you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart hears , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will question a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to tell me when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to all and second , she named me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they call no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it , when I am Titan I and my sum@@ s sad , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and thus says it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
it is nothing special about it .
we play and enjoy their sisters , we have a lot and I read out quite dramatic out of the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; .
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing , except for fit .
I am focusing .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exist are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax pins and song , in which it &apos;s going to be l@@ etting go , or whatever the girl is getting off in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
a little in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energi@@ zer is coming .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the titanium um@@ ms , that is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I &apos;m telling you who I am writing off using broadcasts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum of the sum is not strength and it is not working specifically .
it is dependent on joy .
true sum@@ s is dependent on the love .
the sum@@ s is the current , which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of the history , which are to be involved tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this for a fixed rule , so I can free me as a work@@ man from any debt .
it is a law , I have no choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum of the sum .
I wish it would be as easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play me as well as you are working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer my job as home .
this confession &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession is painful , because what a human being is working rather than to be home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , I think .
let me be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too busy , none of them is .
we are lying around in the garden , and back , and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we grin@@ d Sei@@ f@@ enbach .
in doing so , I feel predominantly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how one lives , and the sum of the universe meets me .
I &apos;m playing and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped each with the games ?
you can also say it ! say Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you keep me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day dre@@ aming .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they don &apos;t want anything else to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but only 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ et@@ le or K@@ eks can replace me .
and I speak my teenage daughter for about 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need not need .
everyone can attach 15 minutes to the piece , even on a bad @-@ mood !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no washing , no de@@ steering .
the day is short : dinner , the kids bed ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my prosperity , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
give yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out it out and keep it up .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I am victory . friends meet , books read , read the day --
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; just for everything I was abandoned , when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in training , I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not rest for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
do not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens and I find myself back in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it meets me and my soul . I lead me to new ideas . I use it in full turns and love my work again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s that sum@@ s is not ... no more .
wallpapers and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and that &apos;s what I am so grateful .
it is me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in grip . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel me as good mother .
the more I play , the cle@@ arer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country I create , the marathon , the air walls , the great sound , the sum , the sum , the others , the correct sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more makes this unusual , beautiful , naked and new life feeling within me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things from me , I &apos;m looking for life .
that belongs to the job , this means to live its dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to support self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , the patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who attempts to improve nerve features by various surgical measures .
surely they have heard from one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; there is an electro @-@ depth in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s fate , who suffered severe pain and severe pain .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ C@@ ure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach to this dream .
I &apos;d like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help yourself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician , worked day and night in the emergency .
I often provided patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that in case of sk@@ ull brain trau@@ mat@@ a , you must will@@ ingly concentrate the brain and the sk@@ ull pressure .
to save lives , one must decrease the sk@@ ull pressure .
for this reason , one has to remove a portion of s@@ wollen shepherd .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean FranÃ§ois Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist that analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by it ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this fabric .
this is no easy task .
to grow cells from a ri@@ v@@ eins , comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your family .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to flour@@ ish them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois succeeded .
this he looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a family culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you do not know of the Bi@@ ological language , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nests of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface fabric of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell @-@ population that looked like ancest@@ ral cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain stem cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the feeding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain compound from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then the cells are so cultiv@@ ate as it did Jean @-@ FranÃ§ois .
and then select it in color , to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we cut it from scratch on the occasion of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ sp@@ lan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we do these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are using the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we watched the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been taken completely after a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a breach to and honour exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here , see what we were observed under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were cut into seem@@ ly .
the evidence that they show , are these little points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
thus , we trained monkeys with a manual de@@ mean@@ or problem .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made them very well .
in the motor Cor@@ tex , we had reached the manual mot@@ ic level in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , she recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with help of plastic bra@@ id mechanisms . you can recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys that was spont@@ ane@@ ously rendered .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
it is not as accurate and not so fast .
now see , when we cut the cells of honour , the same monkey , two months after the matur@@ ation plant .
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ ropath@@ ological models , for example , Park@@ inson &apos;s Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ anti@@ ate them from humans .
I really hope that I can quickly show you how the human brain gets the means to heal themselves .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need . &quot;
I definitely want .
of course , the question of what is the greatest obstacles , before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one must fill about two kilograms of pap@@ rika and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to launch of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it lasts until someone can come into the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose the patients to accompl@@ ish the treatment and rate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ centre study .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at T@@ ED and that you have told us .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West , we make a great mistake to look at them as of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as essential feelings .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big descendants in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy is completely un@@ democr@@ atically maintained .
in fact , democracy is coming to us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ mistak@@ able as the financial minister of our country -- the democratic process of our country -- our election -- do not affect the savings programs which were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my re@@ union friends who would repeat me if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for a true democracy .
I ask you to believe in common with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sive and def@@ y democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are w@@ alled , our future d@@ ull , and our great , new technologies .
to the subject of waste I would like to point out to an interesting contra@@ diction to date our hosts .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; .
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the school mountain , who th@@ rows his long shade about the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the school of the school ,
but only few are known to his dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which are , however , is to be frigh@@ tened to invest in which it would be productive and income how it could produce productive @-@ lives and even all of the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested , in all the prosperity , machines , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion US dollars would like to have a lot of money , to compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did to rise , except the stock ex@@ iting and to drive real estate prices .
so the debt and the productive capital of the twin summit , which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and thus ensuring a low overall demand that they do not invest in which they do not invest . just as Ã@@ di@@ pus Father , who is of fear that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that cause the di@@ pus kills him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its extremely productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents and especially to finance these technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , which are crucial for rescue the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue : what do we understand among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le pre@@ defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the job value of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these outputs .
the decisive thing of ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they were the working poor , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but is an important and decisive factor which gives them the right to political participation with the same bal@@ ancing act in question of state con@@ sign@@ ment .
the ath@@ en@@ ical Democracy didn &apos;t have kept a long time --
like a candle , which lights very light , it is also quick down@@ stream .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have its roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
for the liberal Democracy came into force when a full separation of politics and economy is possible , while the democratic process was established on policy , while the economy -- so the world of the Group -- a demo@@ cra@@ rative zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since that time , in which this separation of politics and business began , an in@@ her@@ ent struggle between the two , by the economy gradually mig@@ rated and disp@@ osed them .
do you wonder why the politicians are not the same as before ?
it is not about a de@@ generation of her DNA .
it is that one can still be in the government today and yet not in power because the power of politics into the economy is derived and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that are so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nourished and dec@@ im@@ ated , that she is hungry by the end .
similar to the economy , which the policy has so far can@@ alized so far that it is due to the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the Group grows , political goods is increasing , the economic demand falls and the Managing Director of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their company .
the success of the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; sells the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the more the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must meet the policy and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ istic left had this idea for 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t especially good .
the doctrine of the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms would only recover a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : working the working arms !
capitalism does , by replacing the low wage employed by automation and robots .
the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste , and social conflicts are deeper , as soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and consider that we will notice the re@@ unified area , otherwise we will appear in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto @-@ bureau@@ cracy which lets the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements which he has brought forth to survive .
the stronger question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia similar to the human being in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines will serve people and put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener , Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it look like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in the future .
in the field of companies : please make a capital market in which you make money , while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those currently working in the company .
then , all income from capital and funds come from revenue and the concept of labour @-@ labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company who are not working in it and employees who are working there , but not part of the company &apos;s capital and savings , not a large g@@ aps between investment and spar@@ es , and ultimately not a ra@@ ged twin summit .
in the field of global political economics , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ation rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that we did not implement the technical means at that time .
today we have them , especially in front of the background of a unified policy and economy .
the world that I applied to you is becoming more liberal , in which they pre@@ fers privileged people , and mar@@ x@@ ically , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian@@ ically , globally ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian@@ ity .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we decrease in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to decide in politics .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal mar@@ xi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I &apos;ve just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do that , technological development will produce a massive decline in the overall economic demand , what Larry Sum@@ mers is known as &quot; long @-@ term St@@ ag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only be dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise , like Ha@@ ye@@ k , so I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ ling .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you do from the view of Western Europe to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy is , -- a fully demo@@ cra@@ rative zone .
in some respec@@ ts , if I may say so con@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the UK of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be seen now in China , resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now preparing to do that which the West has done in the 19th century , smell enormous according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about their experiences as the Treas@@ ury of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how did you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the euro zone ,
namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the self @-@ term stability , and the den@@ ying that a massive processing line by the euro zone went , and continues to continue developing the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of Greek pre @-@ slaughter -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion that den@@ ced this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , within the European group , continued to deny den@@ ial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to obtain an economic system , which is not re@@ vi@@ able to get out through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may be put out for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistake in your time as the Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness .
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , after 6 months in office , especially in such a cl@@ amped situation , he claimed no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the dealer , to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring only our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the problems caused by the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand out that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one @-@ third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika of the investors who have imposed this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a Colom@@ bian mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all these talks , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of the convers@@ ations , you seem to be even quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
my criti@@ que of the European Union and the euro zone is opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they did not survive , the released t@@ aps will be demon@@ ic , and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to beat the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be possible for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you lie wrong in this point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
the majority of Roy have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that was met by Roy before three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a gel@@ ding and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this to produce the shows and the content of the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard one .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can not select any one .
he needs to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on the curve .
this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received .
when your show is rated 9 and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addi@@ ctive where you saw a season , asks your brain : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough about what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not look on to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes up more thoughts about the average exercise , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t in@@ spire them .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon turns something that is why Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and set them online , where they can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon cri@@ es for nothing , is it possible to get right ?
millions of spectators are viewing this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team , who can take everything .
you can capture when you start the show , when you pick up the parts you will ski@@ p and look at once again .
they collect millions of data to decide using these data , what show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Senate . &quot;
they made this show .
do you know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember this show , because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not just that which Roy and his team worked .
at the same time , another manager has placed a Top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly like Roy is always looking for finding this a super show and he uses data for it but it does something different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , the course what shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find these little details about the spectators : what shows they like those producers , which actor .
when they had all the parts together , they went a chariot and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so it &apos;s where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competent data .
they connect these many data , and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic occurs somehow , that it should work with everything .
if one colle@@ cts millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years on statistics as a back @-@ up .
you are optimized it by very powerful computer .
that least what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis is so not working , this is somewhat frigh@@ tening because we live in a time , in which we live more and more statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software . if you are in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is here in the US and in order to ask , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can really be bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . that &apos;s not the fact that a company does not know how Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data reversible firms are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was able to predi@@ ct data analysis of flu out@@ breaks , the bad way -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news station . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , that was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data fail to test companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes .
in spite of all these mistakes , data can be reflected in the decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the dispute , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ ai@@ ded Gene@@ tics -- a area where some very wise people utilize un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I identified some samples about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do you need to do two things :
when designing this problem into its components , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place , put the individual parts together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis can only be good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you to break a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we have it all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and plays again , even if the information is in@@ complete , to hold a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they use data to understand their audience better , why they would not have been able to understand . but the decision how to put all of these parts , put it back and from it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they are using TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and not to forget this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also known as &quot; Magic 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ques or No question you will only need to shake your ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most probably &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will follow it later with a Techni@@ k@@ demo .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , where I should listen to the ball on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace these by something much better , as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . in the end it is to meet decisions when we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the curve .
and I highly encour@@ aging this as a very encour@@ aging message that in spite of the great amount of data still paying off to meet decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks to enter .
because at the end it is not the data , but the risks involved , which you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
