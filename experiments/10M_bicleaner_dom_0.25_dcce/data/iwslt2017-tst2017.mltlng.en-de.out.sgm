<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he wrote spectacular that the NSA had been illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter, that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">It describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA handed down literally designs for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter did not like this?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move, he was to condemn the symbol for the design of the government, Whistleblower followers and to defeat journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Council, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government drew near Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen also lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something has happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were for years of age, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can always be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and ride to the statements, they could also do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigator, without its consent, worried up his telephonn√©,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail, financial and banana information, its credit card, and even travel speed with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistlebone and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, that is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised his attraction to protect Whistleblower followers. but instead, justice condemned him more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is involved too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of it that a sinhistlebone went into a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the press work on the game that should be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more possibilities to send them all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can contact that from the moment they get in contact, instead of the hinder, in the stuff.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that had not yet been writing as Risen his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source basis system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's history, which was developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I work, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and saved on a server, to which only the respective News Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer create information secretly, and many of the information that would request it would not be available from pre-outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the Press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments in all the world develop new spying technologies that are all endangered.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to be sure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to make abuse of abuse. it is exactly the same that we protect the next honeycomb</seg>
<seg id="39">The above abuse of the supply of soldiers did know and will report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environment-workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallpaper Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our of the constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data collection of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and powerful] [enormous money sums) [is] hidden by Global Witness.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents based in Panama's resident law firm Mosquay Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of the tax-rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that a bundled by the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad spoke mail-based companies in control rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a footprint of 2 billion US dollars came to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, a narrow friend from children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and to the next reveal documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency owner, or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weeping from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax-phases and not all its taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing the media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens from a few minutes to hide and concealed your fortune - something that we have been discussing and unveil since ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these heloases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always make it to me like a Matrjoschkapo.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in a further company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans, those who came in these revelations in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there is no rich American who hide her fortune in tax rabbits.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which these heloases work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data transfer from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one needs fewer information in some U.S. states to give less information to establish a company than to get a library reference ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees to zores school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is permitted to zoom on any vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we sent a hidden examination to the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked to us that everyone else could put on a lawyer to our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-presidents. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted our secret investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, by corruption, tax curses, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very violent, as if we could not do anything against it, if nothing ever changed, if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen preaches to more transparency what the owners concerns firms.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who is really behind firms in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentators, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of the control rabbit, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy, who rise up and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use themselves to end through the laws of this type of transparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally terminate the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax curses, corruption and money launderwear.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, just as I abducted almost, and in the caffeine room of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained, and looked my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through all the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you asleep here tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I've just got to know it yet! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to go away in the boot space of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small caffeine room!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard of saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "how please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I froze on the ceiling and thought: "Oh dear! what have I broken up?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild bobbed in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I was afraid that I climbed up out of the bed, on the toe peaks at the door, and closed my sleeping room.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he had bought from me, is now on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends who were only waiting for it to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at the time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can create it, be troubled in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have transgressed how we could earn something. our apartment is equipped with a designer bed and breakfast-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on the air froze on wood floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham Omelts completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we went to our last guest and got the door to the castle, Brian and I started to start.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we would like to create a web site on which people publicly posts from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are going over.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, they can then invite the wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not put it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still with comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one gets to things that can be good. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create new trust by design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make a little bit?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a cost sample, which degree of confidence we moved.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet attacks of panic, which you will feel right -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when it open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal as your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who has actually got Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter, that he is the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had introduced only once with his name, if he had told how he does, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you had 150 attractions, who say all: "he can really hold fast mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you need to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to give negative consequences.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both the host and guest releases were released, before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted with Stanford a study. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to the age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social depressed.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add to the call of a person - in our case by appointment.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three departments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation down similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deep spies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we discovered that trust is dependent on how much people are in price.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell little about how" "" "hi!" "", "you don't get any answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "there is therefore an optimal degree of offence, e.g." "" "Toller works in your flat!" "" "I'm doing with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design, to make this degree an offence?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which topics should be written.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices over strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">By which we were not counting, the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not allowed parties to celebrate or have ruined homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more limmerit than these calls. it's hurt when I think only remember.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which one hears in the voice of Anrude, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, of the 123 million overnight stays there was only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When it works trust, marvelous works can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend to take heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they do not know any thing.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car at the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course not running every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction is exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled up for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of particle work together with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just a "rental industry" to call, the thing is not just.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, the human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one travels today, it is possible to compare fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, when travelling a vast buffet of local inhibit?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at every place you visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a group there, and to show one of the pubs in a pub, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you want to cook a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments of reason to shared one?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have shared the idea of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine the cities which enable us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and amortization.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital, this project had already begun. many parking places that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a lead, were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Have been conveyed to people whose children were moved. the incubation programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share of economy. over our platform 785 000 people in 191 countries alone will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be so crazy, as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were some similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why does our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from fortunate and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-root advantages.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it in bloom,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downturn too overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about that when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underpressing a brapist, a terror ist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay while security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent what I like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of coverage about Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seashegrowing fitness fanatic in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga is singing, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual men, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why are you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny one was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, and from the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and perfect beauty deal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have to do with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, I thought that he was doubted and eventually thought.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion that deepen himself with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik will sometimes bring me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone wanted you to perceive, that she understands, and somehow she loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the "Egyptian" American Dream. "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, sat down at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" "" "Express" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people spigsaws from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock changed rapidly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I switched to the TV channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""... "" "..." "" "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country, but in the Nu transformed me the acts of others by a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East to go to a new city and to begin with the advanced studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I left -- as we went silent - so deep it went in my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, when I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, they said, "Be careful," Abide in well lit areas, "says you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed all the week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to the Bite.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again loud the warnings:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw me the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were of understanding, and I heard also of attacks on Muslims, or of men who died for Muslims, in the free time.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandances on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have thrown the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in that country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to forbanish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like from a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It's only the question: are we malignant or bad?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour are being removed as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all the Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but an important organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are Inventors and Teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympias.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques in America will make a safer place?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps a few parking is free, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of faith tolerant, and greater public participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington region, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radialisation process, it is found that it is possible to start from their own assembly, even from their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitors or abhed by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radialisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">After all, a group like the IS proves its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslims, as a mother, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to the world, if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "" "" "but if you have a look at it, it does not drives what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they have prepared to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she spoke, brought them to silence, and told her that their anger, its sense for injustice in the world, she would only bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired by nothing and something that was given to their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists who gave her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accused them for their anger, he showed her structive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she met in the mosque, she kept it before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear of every day affect our democracy and freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reported assals messages in which negativity was reported, they voted rather military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">That is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the mood against Muslims were shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this was three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the war of Iraq, and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terrorism, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public, in order to expand the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and informative citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">How to deal with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as first, but the toxic air of fear terrify us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not only to explain himself to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the most generous, most generous people whom they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her CV. she was stubborn and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is it a young man having become a young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne during her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon. he did it in her flat as in an execution after he posted external attacks on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be unmorally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the Mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We contemplate it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was why we want to leave to our children: one that would control ourselves through fear, or one in whom we can exercise our religion free.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery, we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw he had sent me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the imam made an announcement, thanked, and called our guests welcome, because the half of the Jews were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack ourselves, but to be partakers of us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion in panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you going to vote in the moment of anxiety and fan?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you connected to those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks well!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself what you say that you may claim that you are a TEDTalk to work a monument with deep thinking, such an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't forget. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I usually am as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">When people look on the Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on the whole world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to work, and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in no respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">As a platform for Basters started, a billionaire is standing shortly before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet deposition into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they started flying with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connected by connecting connections high speed and acceleration in the highest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build independently able structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to carry loads to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the Possible in the autonomous area.</seg>
<seg id="415">To make a system autonomous, it has to know collective condolences, where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic applications.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available in the highest layer. e.g., "start" and "landing."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most strong whiskers, it can hover and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a reversal page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of the tailor is that it is sensitive to turmoil as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position can be recovered and improves the performance through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often have basic abstract questions about the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known to be known as machines with a thousand moving parts that devote himself to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">More than decades ago, pilots of remote control units were flying, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear ruster.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong ago, we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner that served mechanically, served airbrush. it was invented in short-time.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clauses, hinges and cross-edge, no further pitch or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the inner life a lot happens so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithms of the tail. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it right, if everyone is sure, is low, therefore I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in geness cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this inflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is living in his direction.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he will receive the austerity skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction he rotated, or even as he rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be found in models, the rest will be learns directly to fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate rudder propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other on the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls from, the electronics or a battery -- can the machine fly further, even when restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that to make half an airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where the room is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully motivating these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine because on Broadway you would like to take a flyer lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage is in the development and the Schaffensact.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and charming is our universe, and that it allows creative, clustering socks to form them in so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive and economical potential, the bag pointed is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, there traveled two black holes in a very far away galaxy. they walked so far the mass of three smen in a tenth of a tenth of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, shining bright as all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very great bye.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given in the space-time geared and the universe exploded in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, a majority life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has resulted in a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand for us with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group decided to build a huge laser detector from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- to look for gravitational waves, which are produced by colored black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them for mad.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as a crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation was funded its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser Interfervent-Observatory Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following time, the precision of LIGO increased significantly, what the detection performance improved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO started to clarify some smaller, hard-nesting problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colored black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the leave of my toddy Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied Gravitational waves from black holes and its sidetainees as LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a croachment in the geared of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When tightening the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and to the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturer in courses of the theory of relativity often lead to a real berty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"expand and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for instance, each of us extends on the waves of the waves, the expansion of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser-detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandths of the radius of an atomic nucleus exactly. that is Grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are mighty.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finite and with the support of the public, all barriers will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott proves that LIGO was more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: factions, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or map of things to perceive that you perceive by several points of light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">The sounds is different with tones.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult to produce an image of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close behind the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice" speaks.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dune Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we can make no easy pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But as we pay attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO measured the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in Shall, we can hear the All literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott employed very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circlings simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, one hears the same pair of audio tracks with an extra sound change. that is what it sounds like: Wu-wu-wu:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the shaft form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date which at least I've never forgotten -- heard the noise of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass that will turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us know what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the diest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each other for a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">It consists of the lasting importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to explore the universe, as she was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to all listen and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in All we can't see -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserish stars will explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur in the heart that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the primitive one would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is covered by its own aftergings.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using Gravitational waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen, and of which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by hearing.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the first race things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: the kind of stars that produce black holes as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the suction bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to reveal another perspective on the events of all, in the emergence of the stars and finally, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and the caterpillars of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatoria -- a whole new generation of observatoria on earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be better than to listen to the primitive man?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams you with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Before some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year long would I say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of which I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether they made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Do I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted I to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted I to start with the scene?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And then a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, that changed my life to unexpectedly. it started with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett, and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls on all "estimation,"</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"I estimate, I need milk for my beak-asses."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was just in the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new living setting in my family. from there I swear to play always with them as soon as you call me to do. no matter what I am doing, or whither I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I do trouble me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has a bloounding side effect: only recently I understood that" "" "Yes" "" "to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things from you uptake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I'm produous TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TVs, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for that 70 hours of program go out into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that are not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a episode of a TV set can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say 5.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four TV programs, four TV programs, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes, the same time in production, 16 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series run in 256 different languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally, and 45 of these 70 TV lessons are broadcasts that I created themselves, and not only produced so far. I have to find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes this yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you out.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work so hard as you are looking for a company, a country or a classroom, so you understand that I'm not just around your computer, and imagination, and it's right when I say: I understand that it is not dreaming with a dream home.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the job, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It was when I set up troops on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream man you get a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyonc√©.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and disruptive, clinically and disruptive, clinically and rational, cruel and rational. and the best it is the sum of the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums listens to a busy street, I could drive for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I tell them the Summon that I wrote letters, that the writing is preparing to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started to work with TV production, when I started working and work, build and assemble, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, you don't have to strive for a different size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise can be compared to the size, no matter what price does.</seg>
<seg id="624">That is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe there is also a workhorse to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it means Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made of failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan I and I know that I want to question it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: ever more shipments, the more shipments, the more episodes, the more works there are, the more works at the same time, the more do I write history, even more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the great sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, outdated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mom is a single work title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom is not there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerald says: "estimation, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It's the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work anymore. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanen-work, 15 hours-day, continuous weekends, no remorse, don't cover a titanium, does not give up, with perfect heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun any more.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All things I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes one doing so when what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul you, the author of the author" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you are doing, you're working to be a teacher, a banker, a mother who knows when you know the sums, and knows how the sums really know when the sums stopped, who is then you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "will question a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way to the outside, late and she says:" "" "mom, don't you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to tell me when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to all and second, she named me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "they call no more" "" "estimation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it, when I am Titan I and my sums sad, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and thus says it," "" "mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and enjoy their sisters, we have a lot and I read out quite dramatic out of the book "Everybody Poops".</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing, except for fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focusing.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exist are sticky fingers and humid kisses, tender voices, wax pins and song, in which it's going to be letting go, or whatever the girl is getting off in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">A little in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energizer is coming.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">Now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workmen, the titanium umms, that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I'm telling you who I am writing off using broadcasts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum of the sum is not strength and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of the history, which are to be involved tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered to God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this for a fixed rule, so I can free me as a workman from any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sum of the sum.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be as easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me as well as you are working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer my job as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession "confession" "" "" confession is painful, because what a human being is working rather than to be home? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I think.</seg>
<seg id="728">Let me be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too busy, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are lying around in the garden, and back, and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind Seifenbach.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how one lives, and the sum of the universe meets me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I'm playing and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped each with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me for naiv, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they don't want anything else to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienketle or Keks can replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I speak my teenage daughter for about 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can attach 15 minutes to the piece, even on a bad-mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no desteering.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids bed ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my prosperity, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel sums to feel a place for his soul.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Give yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I am victory. friends meet, books read, read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" just for everything I was abandoned, when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in training, I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not rest for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Do not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens and I find myself back in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it meets me and my soul. I lead me to new ideas. I use it in full turns and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums that sums is not... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Wallpapers and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and that's what I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in grip. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel me as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I create, the marathon, the air walls, the great sound, the sum, the sum, the others, the correct sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sum, the more makes this unusual, beautiful, naked and new life feeling within me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think things from me, I'm looking for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, this means to live its dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to support self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, the patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who attempts to improve nerve features by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard from one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." there is an electro-depth in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's fate, who suffered severe pain and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-Cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach to this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I'd like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help yourself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician, worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that in case of skull brain traumata, you must willingly concentrate the brain and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, one must decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this reason, one has to remove a portion of swollen shepherd.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean Fran√ßois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist that analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by it?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this fabric.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a riveins, comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to flourish them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-Fran√ßois succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a family culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you do not know of the Biological language, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nests of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface fabric of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell-population that looked like ancestral cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the feeding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our regular cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain compound from the non-linguistic area and then the cells are so cultivate as it did Jean-Fran√ßois.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then select it in color, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we cut it from scratch on the occasion of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we do these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are using the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we watched the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been taken completely after a few weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a breach to and honour exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here, see what we were observed under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were cut into seemly.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show, are these little points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">Thus, we trained monkeys with a manual demeanor problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">In the motor Cortex, we had reached the manual motic level in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, she recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with help of plastic braid mechanisms. you can recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that was spontaneously rendered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we cut the cells of honour, the same monkey, two months after the maturation plant.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example, Parkinson's Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imantiate them from humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can quickly show you how the human brain gets the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can't need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what is the greatest obstacles, before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one must fill about two kilograms of paprika and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to launch of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it lasts until someone can come into the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose the patients to accomplish the treatment and rate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a great mistake to look at them as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as essential feelings.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big descendants in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while the policy is completely undemocratically maintained.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is coming to us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakable as the financial minister of our country -- the democratic process of our country -- our election -- do not affect the savings programs which were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my reunion friends who would repeat me if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economical model for a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in common with me, that Lee Kuan Yv, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a trusive and defy democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are walled, our future dull, and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">To the subject of waste I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction to date our hosts.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox".</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the school mountain, who throws his long shade about the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the school of the school,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few are known to his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which are, however, is to be frightened to invest in which it would be productive and income how it could produce productive-lives and even all of the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars have been invested, in all the prosperity, machines, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars would like to have a lot of money, to compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were around at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did to rise, except the stock exiting and to drive real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So the debt and the productive capital of the twin summit, which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and thus ensuring a low overall demand that they do not invest in which they do not invest. just as √ñdipus Father, who is of fear that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that cause the dipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "" "" "its extremely productive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents and especially to finance these technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies, which are crucial for rescue the Earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue: what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle predefined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the athenian democracy was of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to diminish the job value of athenical democracy due to these outputs.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing of athic democracy was and is that they were the working poor, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but is an important and decisive factor which gives them the right to political participation with the same balancing act in question of state consignment.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical Democracy didn't have kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very light, it is also quick downstream.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies don't have its roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal Democracy came into force when a full separation of politics and economy is possible, while the democratic process was established on policy, while the economy -- so the world of the Group -- a democrarative zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since that time, in which this separation of politics and business began, an inherent struggle between the two, by the economy gradually migrated and disposed them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are not the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not about a degeneration of her DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is that one can still be in the government today and yet not in power because the power of politics into the economy is derived and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of predators that are so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished and decimated, that she is hungry by the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similar to the economy, which the policy has so far canalized so far that it is due to the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the Group grows, political goods is increasing, the economic demand falls and the Managing Director of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their company.</seg>
<seg id="948">The success of the "demos" [the people] sells the "demos" [the people] of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the more the waste of human labour and prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must meet the policy and economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxistic left had this idea for 100 years ago and it wasn't especially good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms would only recover a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: working the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does, by replacing the low wage employed by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the waste, and social conflicts are deeper, as soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must redesign the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and consider that we will notice the reunified area, otherwise we will appear in a disease monitoring hyperauto-bureaucracy which lets the movie "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism is the technical achievements which he has brought forth to survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The stronger question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia similar to the human being in "Star Trek," in which machines will serve people and put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener, Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" Matrix "similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in the future.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please make a capital market in which you make money, while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all income from capital and funds come from revenue and the concept of labour-labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company who are not working in it and employees who are working there, but not part of the company's capital and savings, not a large gaps between investment and spares, and ultimately not a raged twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economics, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuation rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that we did not implement the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in front of the background of a unified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I applied to you is becoming more liberal, in which they prefers privileged people, and marxically, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesianically, globally keynesianity.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we decrease in a "Matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to decide in politics.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I've just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do we do that, technological development will produce a massive decline in the overall economic demand, what Larry Summers is known as "long-term Stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only be destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise, like Hayek, so I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely wirling.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clear what you do from the view of Western Europe to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy is, -- a fully democrarative zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say so convocative, China is similar to the UK of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be seen now in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now preparing to do that which the West has done in the 19th century, smell enormous according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Treasury of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How did you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the self-term stability, and the denying that a massive processing line by the euro zone went, and continues to continue developing the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of Greek pre-slaughter -- the way, the first suggestion that denced this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, within the European group, continued to deny denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to obtain an economic system, which is not reviable to get out through political will and authoritarianism, it may be put out for a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistake in your time as the Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness.</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, after 6 months in office, especially in such a clamped situation, he claimed no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in pages of the dealer, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring only our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the problems caused by the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand out that they had a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika of the investors who have imposed this policy:" "" "this was a Colombian mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all these talks, and despite the aggressive Tons of the conversations, you seem to be even quite a-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My critique of the European Union and the euro zone is opposite to someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the released taps will be demonic, and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to beat the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it seems to me, it will also be possible for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you lie wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">The majority of Roy have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that was met by Roy before three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a gelding and describes herself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for this to produce the shows and the content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard one.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He needs to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">When your show is rated 9 and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive where you saw a season, asks your brain:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand side, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough about what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not look on to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes up more thoughts about the average exercise, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon turns something that is why Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and set them online, where they can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon cries for nothing, is it possible to get right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watching while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team, who can take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can capture when you start the show, when you pick up the parts you will skip and look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide using these data, what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US Senate."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do you know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many to remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not just that which Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time, another manager has placed a Top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly like Roy is always looking for finding this a super show and he uses data for it but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, the course what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find these little details about the spectators: what shows they like those producers, which actor.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a chariot and decided not to make a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so it's where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competent data.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data, and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic occurs somehow, that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years on statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized it by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">That least what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is so not working, this is somewhat frightening because we live in a time, in which we live more and more statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in touch with this software. if you are in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is here in the US and in order to ask, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can really be bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. that's not the fact that a company does not know how Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data reversible firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was able to predict data analysis of flu outbreaks, the bad way -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news station. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, that was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data fail to test companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data can be reflected in the decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the dispute, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-aided Genetics -- a area where some very wise people utilize unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I identified some samples about the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do you need to do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">When designing this problem into its components, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place, put the individual parts together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis can only be good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you to break a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and plays again, even if the information is incomplete, to hold a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to understand their audience better, why they would not have been able to understand. but the decision how to put all of these parts, put it back and from it a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they are using TV ideas, then as they chose "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a secure decision because they could always say:" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and not to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also known as" Magic 8 "" "". it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaques or No question you will only need to shake your ball to get an answer. "" "" most probably "" "" -- exactly here at this moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will follow it later with a Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, where I should listen to the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these by something much better, as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. in the end it is to meet decisions when we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I highly encouraging this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the great amount of data still paying off to meet decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data, but the risks involved, which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
