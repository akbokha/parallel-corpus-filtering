Munich 1856 : four cards that change your look to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a pit chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ dener spread the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s anno@@ ying when maps are not currently available .
this one knows that , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i had to show a green meadow instead of a loop road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than the current - but just therefore very close .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then , the cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century , as well as cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ling carpet , which you can not recognize as such .
in the large overview card groups were incorporated for cities and municipalities detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ ot leaves , works .
according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration , these were created between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first surve@@ ying Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War , with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course for military purposes .
finally , when the French troops mar@@ ched with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from February 9 , 1801 , there were today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a widespread Bavaria card .
the Ele@@ ctor Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration .
the primitive hand sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like to find all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of the morning / day is the most impressive capital of the state capital .
the city has expanded steadily into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is the send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the creation of the map , thus 1877 , when the Munich city district .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ stan@@ a focus around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmer against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where the West park is , you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance : when zo@@ oming appears there is a smaller part with d@@ utz@@ ing lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered from the so @-@ called &quot; Origin@@ als &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
there are no small par@@ c@@ els , there are no farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterized by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 show@@ place of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desires in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , there is an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the reference paper , in the area of today &apos;s district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , you can not only read the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the guest house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Ward &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ field highway , people would like to be able to ins@@ ist people with mad@@ ness .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ der@@ itz .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ des accompanied the establishment - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the strings of the so @-@ called Irish .
in addition , he has forbidden to the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , and later it was expanded to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ rel institute in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ s in Germany since 2006 .
young people meet in Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um on the area of the former Au@@ er institutions .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 and was operated in a youth home with training .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was created - in architectural jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main square &quot; in 1856 , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a sal@@ es@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were working and on 5 April 2017 , the ground@@ breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn route .
with the shooting down , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Legal Group published Travel Report for Missouri
the National Federation for promoting Colour has issued a warning for color people who travel to the discri@@ min@@ ent policy and the ra@@ cial attacks of the state after Missouri .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board intended to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , invites af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to aband@@ on travel through the state because a number of frag@@ mentary , r@@ ament @-@ based event occur in the previous state and can be noted here &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the group &apos;s position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently passed law of Missouri , which makes it harder to gain a discrimination against minorities , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , allowing the group to release the party war@@ nings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights that will happen .
they are attached or killed because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we have not heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as r@@ assi@@ stic ver@@ ge against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol at the beginning of the year , when he had no petrol , and was accused by the police in custody without being accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor of the Missouri Council , in which black driver in the state will be 75 percent more common than the White ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be willing to bring up the money money or the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Missouri recorded 100 Hass@@ ine in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ ender programme of the FBI , who pre@@ h@@ ort the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would be more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) was published after the States had passed the immigration authorities to commit people because of immigration fraud which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U for further rein@@ forcement .
travel warning will typically be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in the last time those parties involved in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the f@@ ences project is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher electric fence project is an success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag by Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have developed a picture on the spot .
at the right @-@ gra@@ dient of the Schwen@@ k@@ ard family , representatives of the fishing b@@ acher CD@@ U positions met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Winkel@@ demann initially granted insights into its operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods , 40 dairy cows and also many young k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments all the apartments .
&quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is for him of the aging @-@ free mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , as pi@@ v@@ atory .
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ s , there is exclusively regional .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of F@@ ish@@ bach , he also called the &quot; elem@@ ental project &quot; as &quot; elementary sense . &quot;
I can not generate net profit on the art .
the green area for a lot of work , much must be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have here with the conditions and to fight with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Schwen@@ demann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the ter@@ rier operation and used it to perform this without chemical plant protection and fert@@ ili@@ zers even if it does not lead bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the dec@@ imal project and is glad to promote the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported by farmers from 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare .
you hope that the view of the surfaces could still be moved out for a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they bring their operation , &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor .
farmers stand for the promotion often in the criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the maintenance area is thus 40 hectares , which may not be recorded until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of which was funded by Leader , a quarter contributed to the Municipality of Fis@@ bach .
this way , the farmers were able to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric f@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farms . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Peter white stand firm also : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regional rail line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of female c@@ ences .
the aim is to hold of the Black Forest .
prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR recorded funding .
Moreover , the in@@ separable area may not be bad ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the collection .
for the fishing b@@ acher turnout project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just 16 kilometers of fence .
the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking up the Statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these as well as any other - therefore the sort of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regim@@ es , knew surely what he did when he did a symbolic deal with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N via the proposals of the President to dra@@ stic immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay well , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ bes@@ ers and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have tried him if he had done it .
but he touched their importance , and in particular the significance it was attributed to her as the famous po@@ em of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the Monument , its basis was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the po@@ em that you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is right , but as he formulated it itself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it &apos;s about the contemporary response to the insi@@ sting words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your lab@@ ours , your poor , and your afflicted masses , who year@@ ns to breathe free , / the refuse of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the m@@ ating waste was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural con@@ frontation : it is indeed a conflict of the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place her words after her death at the base - knew very good that she is a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism , in an un@@ used classical photo depic@@ ting the female bre@@ aches of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her po@@ em is the female figure no longer abstra@@ cted - it has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the code with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great her@@ ons as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was denied , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who bring to the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should wear the torch in the rest of the world in the rest of the world .
the torch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception .
indeed , the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus existed in it so as she was seen by the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense therefore , to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and make a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
of course , this is not the perspective to recognize the Miller and tr@@ ump .
their lamps should not shine on the way , but hate hatred , who is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black commends Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two sho@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member of Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Championships &quot; won a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 which starts on Friday .
Black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special needs &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom needs to learn anything from this .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we find out , &quot; said Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that something has done to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that something has done to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy at the corner corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who are competing with Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected to the team capit@@ ol .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
their chapter words was amazing , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes whether they were Scottish or , wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh was entirely of course , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredibly &quot; that 16 swe@@ ets are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads to five British and two European records in the past year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of races .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , which runs 1,500 m , is another scar@@ f which one could watch after a great season , which was to watch the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembers their first world championships , when the only other car@@ rot in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the national capitalist states that it is &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be among the medals and among the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so special about the team capit@@ ol is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team mates voted for me and voted for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added to something very special for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all those who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes competing in Po@@ dien .
what are my speech given as Capit@@ alist ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympic stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it simply will be as a great atmosphere since there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not work for a public office if you do not bear the fuel consumption of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the in@@ vigor@@ ous policy to its political principles .
he is ch@@ imp@@ lied with the criti@@ que , safe .
but he didn &apos;t bring his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away , and , stup@@ id , and dum@@ b , like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who must work on it , to be more like Washington .
ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the posts from at least 450 persons and will be deleted , who have sold their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol@@ , and the online review was full of counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .
h@@ og@@ an is no re@@ ac@@ tionary head .
he showed a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ents of the principles .
he was also very cour@@ age@@ ous to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and acting his hair@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post &apos;s spokes@@ person in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments was nothing further than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of T@@ rolls or spo@@ ilt or h@@ ash filled people who are online the whi@@ p .
the Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no part .
they all said that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , thinking , and not benef@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma of Bo@@ as , MD , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked to break Hass@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented on , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ ine and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think this idea , if a number of people on the same topic decreases , then they are considered as a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Für@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply plug@@ ged a critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when people have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tivity and to burn and kill demonstr@@ ators with a demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens to be digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants that critic@@ ises that he has critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users that were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First Am@@ end@@ ment to the US District judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria when she served a voters from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U due to his use on Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers negotiated between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence on his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous t@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions that criti@@ ci@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trading and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med its position according to the historical document that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not have them to silence .
freedom of expression , freedom of expression and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true command means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former Europeans # 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for the next three days in the comfort of the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the next year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the final round , was connected to the new venue as the tournament owner named the founder and the CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the ren@@ aissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he established this place .
he is a eager refin@@ ement of this game , and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly in &quot; he said that in South@@ port , the player said in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I had won it from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from the past year and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on last year to win here .
it was a truly special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the sea .
this event will be his first Scottish Performance at Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel that additional printing too .
I really enjoyed it to play , and I played a sound of the Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major champ@@ ions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ove .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six jack@@ ets on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
entrance is free of charge , the parking is £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds are going to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passi@@ v@@ smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died due to passi@@ v@@ elling of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung canc@@ ers were due to passi@@ v@@ smoking annually &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he attracted a study on this topic in 1994 .
at that time , more than 400 lung canc@@ ers were given due to passi@@ v@@ rau@@ ings a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove itself as a very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moder@@ ately in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Bau@@ yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the sub@@ strate is much covered in the sub@@ strate , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which always sets out the construction works , represents a big problem for the construction tip of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red amp@@ ons and bul@@ locks is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked the dinner , they don &apos;t use the stove .
they even use only rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - right in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen bu@@ cks is taken with eager , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also leads to her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby s@@ ull .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lan@@ tern .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband you have been assigned no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
of course it can be too late to work too . most of the vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one doesn &apos;t dare to exp@@ ire after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was enrolled in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 were allowed to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched the independence against the Dutch rule , turning quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and includes foreign journalists or legal monitoring .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as wasted as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made its journey here , sof@@ ten as journalists and practically no foreigner .
before christ@@ ians came to Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not acc@@ ust@@ omed to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and refers to their bu@@ zz , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we only had leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s most popular province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst nur@@ ses and alpha@@ bets rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , gr@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has been valued at $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which make sure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military maintains a suff@@ er@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military officers and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars in a single officer .
after greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ anic claims had thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and will be mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and detained .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as in Pap@@ u@@ as , in the 1970 &quot; s , were awarded to the genocide of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the arch@@ diocese of Brisbane , in 2016 , in which reports about the atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture and electro@@ attacks are particularly popular - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week occurred , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts are strengthened , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % of Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changed , as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung Cant@@ ons sell chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ us@@ ss@@ ce .
local people fight to hold here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables to the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains A@@ be@@ th You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - m@@ om m@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
in 2014 , the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to start the ine@@ qualities and the infr@@ in@@ gement of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 out of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we tuned in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point in October , only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ate its inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a violation of her tone and later came to four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , they struck the group with their guns , and said sacrifice and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired up into the group of children .
a child who was 16 years old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so badly struck that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things set forth on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch before the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they were carrying cor@@ on@@ ial hun@@ ts and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle continuously and a Vogel@@ ra@@ ang - of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some prot@@ esters started h@@ amm@@ ing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses were more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME , which was not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Four of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping risk and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly shot into my lin@@ ke wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veran@@ dah of his colourful wood house .
Kay@@ ame doesn &apos;t know who they fired , but says that the sphere came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired . &quot; he adds .
the indigenous man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and under@@ nourished his body to be sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es who carries a name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , the T@@ IME , in dark spirits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the bos@@ sing spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers want to secure their station only &quot; because they would be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta in the following day .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held an passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ ware that the historical mis@@ ery in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to solve this case immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Minister of Security Wir@@ anto said that he will establish a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the Sett@@ lement of Historical Human Rights Viol@@ ations .
but the expres@@ sions started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred prior to long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed to this off@@ ences , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to T@@ IME at T@@ IME at the 5th of June , saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which was accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; for crimes against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such alle@@ g@@ ations with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear of years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sh@@ elling were not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ up@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ g , who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
shooting down the vill@@ agers in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers , who re@@ acted on it by feu@@ dal warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary forces ) began to shoot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have anxi@@ ety that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who was in the vicinity of the hospital and was a witness , as the last one has been delivered quickly , so the T@@ IME .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to attract the officers for the account and to withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident of accidents for the Indonesian Government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ ous development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders originate from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to the last few years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and imprisoned in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some will never emerge again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten location . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is the same except range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf mo@@ wers .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of emer@@ ges were only 10,000 indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ ties between the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flight @-@ gro@@ oves to the um@@ bil@@ ical airport in larger numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually better to the better trained and wealthy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain sharp .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to lack of related coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to them .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the limitations of coverage to promote transparency and development , not implemented .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia , un@@ pleasant provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; said he in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ al states - T@@ ong@@ a , N@@ au@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the I@@ onian Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , investigate the &quot; various and widespread injury &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sh@@ ale .
the same countries have been historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r proved the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to prevent evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people before site want to know that more foreign governments are aware of it .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited during the leadership of the Human Rights C@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the session but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they probably don &apos;t want to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a human being who has good int@@ entions , but it is involved of people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shame , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that there is under the constant threat of a burning military lives in poverty and health services .
g@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai People , like other Pap@@ ua , must consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he must withdraw .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the thre@@ ats and ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a recent symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the bodies of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station .
you may never know that there will be no justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 to a high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that leads in just two years through the high @-@ house which one calls for the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch @-@ tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm , and we got up at the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a residents who attack his name as George , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.00 PM local time ( 00@@ .00 a.m. GMT ) dis@@ sol@@ dered the fire and frozen the building .
the government said they work on the deployment of accommodations for the persons concerned .
the incident can provide questions on safety of materials that are used in external areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the largest proportion of the damage to a covering , the outdoor covering for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain , the police , she believed that the system of boards to isol@@ ate and covering in the London Gren@@ skin tower could have contributed to the rapid spreading of a fire in June , where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is carried out with its big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup single was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single only to two winners , and thin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although it is often very long , but also very well @-@ estimated five @-@ set classics remain the same in the traditional rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries agreed to reform the goal of IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only barely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the complete package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this i@@ con@@ ian and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on to improve the application .
not only the vote was not until the vote was already done before the suggest@@ ion to carry the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists will be the host to the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the following round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizer , the requirements in terms of training places , etc . , and players will have to complete the Davis Cup less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 U.S. trav@@ ellers bring forbidden objects into the plane , found a pol@@ l found out
a survey among flying pass@@ angers revealed that more than 20 percent are aware of or un@@ washed items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft while being acci@@ dentally carried out knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had already been discovered that they had been irrit@@ ated with firing weapons , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the pol@@ l conducted in more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers would like to mis@@ use the rules .
of the respondents said that they had tried to fly with something that was forbidden from the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent of the mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common objects used by T@@ SA agents were evident at T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said that they had borne items with clin@@ gen by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respondents , and 3.7 percent of the male respondents had confirmed that they had been deliber@@ ately banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said that trav@@ ellers have been questioned throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally put s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware by the airport security and how many could have been confident .
it is not a surprise that people who are in s@@ lightest jewelry s@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - because of safety , those who are the most frequently fly .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are too complicated and conf@@ using .
people often are uns@@ afe , which liquids can take away or how much of it .
so , it is no surprise that the greatest amount of fluids in the T@@ SA confis@@ cated items are prohibited .
for a time , the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla @-@ customers charge
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , it has so far agreed that a part of the customers has withdrawn its in@@ binding reservation again .
in addition to the continually tri@@ pled numbers to increase sales and still gigantic sales targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will tell the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly balance for the first time a different , less gl@@ os@@ sy number : if cancelled up to the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k was frequently used in recent months with more than 500,000 reserved orders for the new car , which begins its extradition .
now , Mus@@ k now dream : of the total of 5@@ 18,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics always had pointed out that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation Tesla paid € 1000 to 1000 US dollars ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking request . &quot;
currently , 45@@ 5.000 of such in@@ binding reservations are present in a telephone conference with analy@@ st .
so that the cancellation of up to about twelve percent of all orders could become the problem , the Tesla boss cannot believe .
its argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla had delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is expected to assemble all models - 500,000 one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
those who are appointed a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be ordered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tesla manages to continue its brand new , never in the practice of production lines without greater interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater delays , then the Un@@ binding of the reservations may be for Tesla for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot run dis@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back due to the withdrawal of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt took his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era , to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in relation to re@@ acute faster than previous st@@ entions .
he did not mentioned the complaint , which had been le@@ vi@@ ed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it is a deadline which ran out on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of bott@@ om@@ it o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to pay attention to his authority to study the plan , to study the plan and to hin@@ der it in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump head office of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent on environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated for this to block the regulations , or to decorate the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden change of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority in order to prevent the implementation of a rule by Obama Administration , the oil and gas firms for the surveillance and reduction of me@@ than@@ le@@ cks .
in a review published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ ing in o@@ zone standards simply proposed the read@@ iness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of just@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous st@@ entions , the EPA often has often kept the dead@@ lines for the implementation , and then waiting to be prosec@@ uted by activists , and other accused , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in an regulation of jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also accept the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the statement of EPA indicated that P@@ ru@@ itt would have been able to use his &quot; Be@@ fu@@ sions to the delay and all other legally binding &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress push to a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill for the last month shall be delayed by the implementation of the 2015 regulations for at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , who accused the EPA in this week , said that the Group intends to rec@@ tify the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6,7 million New York and the over 115 million Americans that are affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cutting man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ y , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive groups of human problems and help each year to thousands of premature death cases .

Walter Mart@@ ini st@@ resses : &quot; it is a unique little jewe@@ l . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Baden @-@ Württemberg document : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the present parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and on his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document according to the document , in the tum@@ linger hill except for the former parish church there was also a splendid farm , which belonged to the church or the patron , and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Freuden@@ stadt of 1858 , beside the Lower @-@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the constellation of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village .
old cards from the time around the year 1600 were the differences of these historical events .
the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ law originated in the early medieval town law .
the Lord , who built a church , moved and occupied with a priest , remained in the mind of this church , and was also inherited the owner of this place .
thus , the right to use a pastor , or replacing a new priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two zer@@ bar@@ ons on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then heard for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) , the window pul@@ leys were stolen and the bell was stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops came near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used it as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809 .
until 1869 the tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius was also served as the last resting place for the dead from the listen@@ ers .
in 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us church was demolished .
only the church was left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm split the bell tower and the half collapsed .
in order to prevent evil , the tower was thrown down .
only today existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em has served as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius station .
as a organis@@ er , the friends and supporters of the tum@@ bling falls on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .

association wants to check out wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal condition for the construction and therefore turned on to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , there is a wind power concentration zone at the time of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible at the same time , the concentration zone provides a exclusion of wind power use for the rest of the city area .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; saving of the landscape . &quot;
the town of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier by a change in the Flemish protection plan to a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it had not been approved by the Düsseldorf government in Düsseldorf for a lack of formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning approval , the approval of the approval of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the current status of the things : the Stad@@ thalle once again decided before the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still standing .
creation : &quot; this means that the author@@ ization of wind energy systems planned for the construction of wind turbines were excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received since the last week at circle four , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to check out the matter again .
but it is not expected to take that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the current proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday did not refer to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , is planning to build the construction of four ( 200 meters high ) on an area of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
in the past year , the company , which is involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , had already been involved with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement is to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to roughly one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , Vier@@ sen Municipal joined the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ nich at Aachen as well as a shar@@ ehol@@ ding in the wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ berg in Hein@@ sberg / Germany .

tr@@ ump continued after a sealed tran@@ scription of phone call in Mexico under pressure because of payment of the mar@@ g@@ inal wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump called for a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , publicly announ@@ cing that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president declares him , because he den@@ ounces the wall , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first appearance with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m gy@@ z were also published and revealed an un@@ cle@@ ated exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. gy@@ ms said that a trade for the United States refugees emigrated to Australia , and that the existence of the business , which was conve@@ yed by the Obama Administration , would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; to look like a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said this turn@@ around in the Lord , &quot; this is the most un@@ pleasant call for all day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activists lead the assi@@ stic Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and one white driver had reached the bridge , there came a group of white men with guns to block his way .
the leader of the Mob@@ s - a man @-@ middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous man - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ sof@@ ten the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want to try this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ared the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es in silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was crushed .
fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , was just a reproduction .
but if a sn@@ ares are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , they beat out almost all in the audience .
since 2005 , civil servant to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge has come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ com , as well as George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged on the mor@@ se .
&quot; it is really un@@ clear that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we know them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organisation of the reproduction .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of Georgia and a long civil servant .
it serves for him as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong was never been corrected .
&quot; we want to be tra@@ secu@@ tions , we want to terminate , we want to be healing , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation until we get righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician puts a bed @-@ towel on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI agents , who were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of either Monroe and the neighbouring coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody was charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been staying for decades on free feet , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch promotions during the whole city was ever known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens to Georgia for the first time to vote in their vote in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ col@@ m a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly on account of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our had been in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby was born , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ lord , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins in Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when she turned away from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge moved , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was out , it was Harrison who prepared Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI &apos;s report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the killing of evidence that the evidence of evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks has formulated it even more splendid .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ ent massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send message to black people in this community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you register and if you agree , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in almost a decade , C@@ ass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene led the annual evidence of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is clearly visible , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to look , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we are confron@@ ted with their skins in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship to you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in one room and listen , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ eds for years , but he said that the role does not get easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story on life because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ co , tried to play the Roger Mal@@ col@@ on and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with the Mal@@ col@@ m , the test@@ ers and thron@@ ged him , so that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have disappeared from my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shaving en@@ vi@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lau@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; she asked him .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , always ki@@ cking .
&quot; I do not believe that white people were &apos; n &apos; n &apos; --@@ he &apos; said . &apos;
&quot; but &quot; swe@@ at one of the other black performers .
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly then the energy is moving in the space , a feeling of camera ship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts at once .
this time when Ras@@ ar says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no man laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition ends for@@ ci@@ bly and quickly .
there are Sch@@ re@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads to low holidays &apos; St@@ range Fru@@ it &apos; .
their voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people were silence and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity , when Bro@@ oks lead them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the mur@@ ders remained an A@@ ne@@ d@@ ote , but now if one finds on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels much .
when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites you to come closer and in@@ spect the bodies of bodies .
children li@@ cks on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene the quantity - and suddenly there is over .
the actor throw away the Lyn@@ n@@ eil and wipe out her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ d .
Nick Ras@@ co surro@@ unds two of his fellow players , and he breaks out into their poor wine , and the emotional load of the performance breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; says one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later , the audience is bringing together with the actors to dinner together .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta is stim@@ ulated about the reproduction with a black couple that they have just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski came to find words , which I did not leave the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to listen to these terrible words and deeds ... of people who like to look like yourself and do that as you look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what does this really do with me , believe me that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks at his table are eating and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started to start the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way because it describes the terror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so if we can learn anything from it , then it can happen again .
he who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ k &quot; reconciled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf has reli@@ ed on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging before gigantic , six @-@ storey back@@ drop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the swing stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pla@@ stics and E@@ la@@ zy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pla@@ stics and E@@ la@@ zy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR and the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before it par@@ ked , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhine sky@@ lights will posi@@ eren as ro@@ cker girls , or alternatively a is@@ etta .
Gest@@ ated oil painting are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs Guidel@@ ine - Money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through its &quot; ring . &quot;
the three Rhine Sc@@ ene - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ ses and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonder@@ fully .
so , they lead to Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , zer@@ os in Hollywood man@@ ier a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the ri@@ chn@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ d@@ ese Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene , as he sm@@ iling Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) also needs to believe .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , celebrated himself in a modest way and prevents the hands of the Merkel @-@ cat@@ er@@ ted .
there is great appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in leg@@ ory leisure .
with tension , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ i@@ ete@@ am was expected .
at the end of 2013 , he had to have a score of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concert for himself , and there were five years later in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; Ru@@ fe went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to rejoice in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you noted that the audience had grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ or , but it &apos;s also an understanding for its visibility .
I go a positive conclusion .
max . works as volunteers
they work in their volunteer year at several places .
where to everywhere ?
lot : normally in Capri@@ furt in the furniture fair , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open day at school .
how are your experiences thus ?
lots : it is a nice , broad spectrum , which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years old , i.e. a late volunteer volunteer .
how does it come ?
lot : I have made school high school .
and then a civil engineering , we say , successfully interrupted .
I realized for me that it is wrong for me and I want something else to work with people .
and then I asked what you are doing .
do a social year , since there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there one can see how it is on site , in the burning point perhaps , really is .
and was it so ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not an unusual thing , while volunteers have several different applications ?
lot : yes , it is very variable .
it always comes to where you make his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the age @-@ house to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care system .
for me that was exactly the right thing that has provoked me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths as it really goes .
differently than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to understand stati@@ cs .
one has always left other people , which each have a completely different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been recovered from the family - one must always enter on it .
very interesting .
and you had no contact details ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is .
Pear@@ son dis@@ counted another 3,000 work@@ places and dis@@ counted the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British Education Group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build up further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim measures by 72 percent as a further restructuring program was started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confron@@ ted .

EPA returns the decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints around
the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to prevent the regulation of Obama &apos;s government to withdraw from which the States are obliged to em@@ ulate Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the Agency &apos;s agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had previously announced the goal of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be fixed , where sub@@ sections have to be made to comply with high @-@ quality air@@ quality standards - to be delayed until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental impact that the former President Barack Obama raised , as part of a wider agenda , which is to stim@@ ulate economic growth according to tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have caused the response of the demo@@ crats and reserves of nature to worry about the effects of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as As@@ thma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or wants to become common room
at the end the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ dy decides to set up the establishment of a common room in the future retirement pension .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to last until the church community is owned by a private investor , there is no planning to develop a private investor &apos;s project .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor there would be a living area of around 55 square meters - and a adjoining terrace with a total area of 70 square meters are available for a special price .
administration and majority of the municipal council stipul@@ ates such a common room not as the meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just residence , but open to the church .
as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
in the last autumn , the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been allocated in the past fall .
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be reported to conve@@ y@@ ades , with 60 per cent of 30 percent .
the decision of the decision to indicate that in this regard , there is no b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs , that is similar to both arti@@ cul@@ ation - what is reduced to the surrounding area - as also P@@ ult@@ z &apos;s roof - which makes the tr@@ ump sum and its construction would be possible .
need@@ less , that &apos;s not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
when it helps : unanimously it happens the panel .
it is not as simple as the common room .
Daniela B. refers to the many own buildings with which you do not get so well ahead , the back@@ rest you can now move into the common room from the window , says : &quot; I am doing so hard to do . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks to the common room - however , absolutely against a municipal participation .
it just sees a hidden subsi@@ dence to you , or at all , as well as Foreign Invest@@ ors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface you don &apos;t give a supplement , but get a real , in a branch fall , the counter value reads .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , submit the decision to the decision , finds three fears .
thus , with two objects in the original programme , Stefan H@@ aller contains this : &quot; if we hold the decision , we will make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z it is supposed to be the first &quot; star@@ ring path . &quot;
this plan is planning the association Z@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planning way in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ ring ad &quot; to meet the information need of many har@@ ness visitors , called it .
he connect nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route tables and inform about stars and stars .
in a first phase to 2018 , the club plans to reach &quot; well @-@ reaching installations to five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quiries to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown &apos;s situation , Hohe@@ ge@@ iß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be supplemented by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ board train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star trail , the viewer experience a lot of knowledge , for example above the physics of the single stars , &quot; explained the association .
Moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , even though it is far away .
to be conve@@ yed in which constellation can find a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , located at the highest peak of the observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Natural protection , the location of the National Park of Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the dairy road and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with a naked eye clearly see .
in the University of the University , there have been something similar to the planetary planet &apos;s initiative since 2003 on the initiative of the planet@@ arium - the planet route .
starting from the building of the hotel in the Go@@ e@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the inside of our solar system , the planet leads with its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Equ@@ ations ) on the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the plug@@ ging in the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned precisely in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , and it measures 70 centimeters away .
the overall distance of the planet is a good four kilometres .
while the light of the sun is needed for about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fix@@ ation but would take another half a year .

the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded in the accident .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er in the season open@@ er the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
at the beginning of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was very satisfied with the result , because there was not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit into even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Ore Mountains , the rotary chain is to be optimised even further .
and a fool according to a free spins does not want to catch the un@@ ks any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be so that no one will be on the line by Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better right after the experience in preparation with the rotary chain better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we are working in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Radio el , but Hoffmann is his thing certain , &quot; because we just have left the right positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players that can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the prer@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , however , that we have even more harmon@@ ize and we do not work as many errors . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann will also drive to au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak of a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; says Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re on Sunday with four points and we can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over auction but only because the game of Saxony had to be stopped at the time of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can begin the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be a little fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent , as they could not have heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a level of ascension into the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the internal holder of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while guests come from the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the last ( almost ) stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is ble@@ aching &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to beat from pre@@ n@@ ag , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Music coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and exc@@ essive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum seek@@ ers
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of all tested persons older than 18 are , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ dd@@ ess In@@ spec@@ tively ) has begun with the implementation of testing in the past year .
they should make the estim@@ ation of the age on the asylum procedure , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ations@@ Author@@ ities ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) was criti@@ ci@@ zed due to failure in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were min@@ ors old .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et 6.@@ 880 has been ma@@ iled and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eighty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency estimates that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of person is asked in question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable during the past few months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there may be 442 cases that suggest that it was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det under@@ gone the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , made by knee shots of fashion designers and MRI images , which are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also criti@@ ci@@ zed in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ ti@@ cian is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , which includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were earlier or later than usually caused by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson , from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child when adults is in@@ correct .
the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special finger@@ print feeling has the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
for there is also a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected .
the local inhabitants have been informed about the project in the run @-@ up of the project .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building building and the collection in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic can be regulated without a traffic light by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher , the street is in the area of the bridge on the amount of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three jum@@ pers are tot@@ alled 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it up to the end of her life .
but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Kri@@ sten Stewart quite openly about her bis@@ exual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I remember gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celebr@@ ities was the &apos; T@@ wil@@ ight &quot; colleagues of Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally worked in bitter .
in spite of all things , the Brün@@ ette performer against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love seriously , whom I knew .
or do you think , I have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten said that she is bis@@ exual : &quot; I have lived with du@@ alism forever and believed seriously .
it has never been confused or disabled .
I never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang entertainment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time they prefer to dress like a Bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public did not tell their love life : &quot; people expect you to keep you in a certain way , and that anno@@ yed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as und@@ an@@ kl@@ ed , but I don &apos;t like to justify me before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
. the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening of a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers ... today I will tell you as a population of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifest@@ ation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not accept the Democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes certi@@ fies that he has coal mine in five states , and have inherited a carbon dioxide from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the interim , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening , in which he said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather be hin@@ dered to us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative body in history , the announcement of Governor &apos;s Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , reasonably priced message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E praise &quot; honourable &quot; Russian debt for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world @-@ wide chief of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , comm@@ ended on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment to be taken up for the country again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics CEO D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ ess said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was successful from the sport and that he was determined to combat d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for maintaining the ban adopted in November 2015 after a report from the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found on state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was today a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the repor@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation experienced themselves in themselves that they have experienced some quite hot times and to make everything possible to ensure that the Russian Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said that he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize the situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to split the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin competing in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden coach are still free , he said to Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a talk to the IA@@ AF Council .
p@@ act for in Mali crashed soldiers
during a fun@@ eral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar around 1000 people have thought of the two during a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to clari@@ fy .
they called the two different pilots , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner &apos;s &quot; professionals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest offering in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their S@@ är@@ ge was transferred to Germany and on Thursday , accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr to the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er cathedral Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church arrived at goo@@ db@@ ye .
after that the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of family , eng@@ ages friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the fun@@ eral of the ro@@ ses laid down in the hand of the ro@@ ses , which stood at arm in arm .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ k and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen , awarded the rec@@ ited soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and ri@@ mon@@ ed .
the Chief Operating Officer saw the flight operation of the fighting helicopter in Frit@@ z@@ lar with up and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
also , Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , said to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have mo@@ aned . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service , they were brought to the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ a ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
the King &apos;s house divided on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple has been buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , and he was in the communication of the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his home country .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a meal that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ a in 1972 , he became king .
in 2016 he retired in the retirement and puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ ory . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark would not have the title and function that he wanted to see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , declared LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the principal speaker at the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ olds should eventually be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his home country , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nobles , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik sent a heavy stand during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik , in his almost 50 year anniversary .
in an auto@@ biography expressed by Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ id , which I smo@@ ked out of Virginia tobacco and those in Germany were able to be able to hope the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope at night .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
they were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Because I want to re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the day , but he does not want to come back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament look for the resolution of Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before , the surprising return of a Green dep@@ uties from their country ski freight in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its cris@@ p one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded her step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday .
CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to its Group .
so that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag is elected regular to the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether they could continue to reign in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil holds it for un@@ intenti@@ onal that the Land@@ tag decides to move his self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further anticip@@ ation on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution will also see the possibility that the country &apos;s Parliament will escape the trust and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options need to be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will answer all the questions if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but slightly cur@@ vy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politi@@ cian even stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very well . &quot;
they called themselves as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Green called on the back@@ sliding dep@@ uties for the return of their country championships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course aware that she has received the country list which has received over the green state list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Chair of Met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the background , there was no content differences , we can not follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz was sentenced to CD@@ U to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Friday on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he under@@ line the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ choose the Land@@ tag quickly .
the outlet of Western Europe will cost Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its last vanity and in her fresh@@ ness , personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this very dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ ation and tried to propose from it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Prime Minister Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its MPs to record El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U .
the parliamentary leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed to drive T@@ ash@@ ore , with personal bel@@ ong@@ ers , supporting the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens in the country day but had a small majority vote of a voice .
agriculture Minister in an interview - How do we protect against Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discussed about contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect the consumer .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German Editor Network ( R@@ ND ) address and answer .
Lord Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amped pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder are the latest information about the affected eggs char@@ ds .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we are currently aware , a health insurance is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ n@@ aissance of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture does not really get noticed ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has left without delay and has been settled in close exchange with the authorities of the countries in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and the risk assessment are available for consumers .
trading has just like the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are bu@@ si@@ able and health harm@@ less .
if using eggs of the return base content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ bu@@ sti@@ ble .
un@@ loading eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the establishments are not bl@@ ame .
sit Production and consumers in the same boat ?
after the ze@@ iti@@ cultural key , the production plants are not an immediate fault .
in fact , it must be due to im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is a bit control in the harvest .
is it only missing in the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
there were just the official controls , which have revealed the operation .
however , to the truth , however , food income and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
this is why a resol@@ ute En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of such acts and hand@@ over to the Heads of State in the cases are of crucial importance .
I have already made several times , that I expect a l@@ ymp@@ h explanation of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m in case of food and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are entitled to right .
by the hired means , manufacturers , merchants and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
principle must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the in@@ se@@ cti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it has to be consistently with high pressure on all levels .
I am expected by all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is completely fl@@ acci@@ d and clari@@ fied .
how to move to Paris the financial rules of the football on N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars move to Paris
rules , which aim to prevent further issues of European soccer clubs , N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars are not distur@@ b from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain in Paris .
any of the consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA EURO , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has supervised the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA EURO , means that PS@@ G could prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to more than ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars moves to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money can easily make money , so N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ wealthy family of Qatar .
a lot of money must be applied for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but with legitim@@ ate integration of application , which allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
the FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after its election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ sat@@ in had enormous debt in their quest , effectively su@@ cking and ris@@ ky to recru@@ it when banks or owners went their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P disp@@ leased from the concentration to the liabilities of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , Roman Ab@@ ram@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then strong invested in order to improve the crew and build a global brand - to a harder issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P license period , which runs until 2018 , clubs may decrease losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , the UEFA successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to make sure to qu@@ ail from exc@@ essive expenditure .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week .
even though the PS@@ G buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar paid in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years to be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the worst sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the teams of teams for the Champions League in the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA Cup is looking for clubs , who could try to over@@ see their financing of funding by taking their revenue from companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ist company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA EURO would not be deemed legitim@@ ate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA of Qatar was blocked by Qatar .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar may be made via payments of the organis@@ ational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM Amb@@ ass@@ adors will be easy to find a der@@ ail@@ out man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA EURO will still be att@@ entive , every attempt to observe the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars transfer , which are familiar with the situation on Thursday .
they spoke in the condition of the An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year have to be published yet .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the association assumes that sales after the signing will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best soccer players to see , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ m@@ ars Weg@@ train , saying that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a cle@@ arer case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding the official owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La League against a State that is co @-@ financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the ball in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the finance Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ g@@ il@@ e@@ fer
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board has produced chocolate for the Swiss .
now the shooting will be in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ h@@ l@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA , a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current plans , the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said spokes@@ person .
around 17 million small red boxes packed in ch@@ og@@ g@@ it@@ boards grow to 14 grams a year before landing on the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a pre@@ stige order for a sk@@ og@@ gi@@ maker .
as many candidates , there is a new call , Swiss does not want to betray the Swiss .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate @-@ producer was not reachable for a statement .
chocolate bars spread out the Swiss francs on board its flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss had completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ ys has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced a two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .

as a cultural ar@@ te@@ facts , it is equally a par@@ ody and a short@@ age of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but when fran@@ chise feels it would be short .
&quot; First Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absur@@ d hum@@ our ( it contained a original history for a promising box of vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by turning on the core of the G@@ ags - actors , middle age @-@ aged children playing children who are growing - they nevertheless managed the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ten Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with his adults who play now adults is less emotional and his par@@ ody goes more after the wat@@ ering principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point shows a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has lost his vir@@ g@@ inity for ever .
and there is another mad @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot which is included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ili@@ pp@@ li@@ enb@@ one of &quot; Singles &quot; , whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old b@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the moments of acci@@ dental that this fran@@ chise could fuel as a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it is achieved what I will see as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how she will visit the film premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of another type of nost@@ al@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americas , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ match @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , an Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers of Bucharest , which fight for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the path of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main rolls - a hard @-@ ten@@ er Gregory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to see ( the police spend time to view chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of the famous spokes@@ man - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - cares for an independent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; voice out &apos; .
but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate prop@@ aganda drama - a murderer , which carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that &apos;s often as a single one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six long episodes , where the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which has been reduced to a lower length , could visit his Ag@@ it@@ r@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swal@@ low up a bunch of Hamburg .
the message for the imag@@ inary audience is that the western culture can do everything to feed the food .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ator aren &apos;t wrong : we can even make it with our own younger story and with them .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police was a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday afternoon , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for how the public prosecutor &apos;s office is shared on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and had already issued warran@@ ts of arrest against them .
in addition , the officers provided larger amounts of mar@@ i@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
on the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total over 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
on the members of the Maf@@ ia , drug crime was accused of severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and rob@@ ber@@ y .
the public prosecutor &apos;s office in the southern German room has been determined since the summer of 2016 .
between the Heads of State in Constance and Palermo a real exchange and investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the big deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the Vis@@ ier of the investigations , there were mainly Italian nationals combined with respect to Italian Maf@@ ia .
a incident on May 27 in hat@@ s , with which several shots were fired in a restaurant at the early morning likely to go on the bonds .
manner be@@ ating large g@@ aps in the alien register
&quot; data from citizens who don &apos;t emerge &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings .
the lead to part serious false @-@ decisions on asylum procedures .
the reference for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , made a media report to great g@@ aps in the foreign register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defic@@ ien@@ cies with the registered data could be carried out there for asylum procedures and deportation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis leading to the German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data have not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality in parts have not been well done so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become a German citizen , and should not emerge in the properties . &quot;
&quot; faulty data , recur@@ ring processes can be much slower , &quot; says the report .
in statistics about out@@ flow people , people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false reasons , however , led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate about dealing with compensation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it is in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government under@@ gone to retreat refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that comes out of an internal paper by the German Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Zealand &apos;s newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is therefore said that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation is on site .
after the Dublin Convention , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state , which they first reach .
when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country .
for the grounds , the ministry is now written : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with min@@ ig@@ ated children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy asked for the recording and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these commitments for enough .
other EU countries will also send refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children strug@@ gles for the defects in the Italian asylum system of human rights un@@ lawful conditions and end@@ an@@ gering child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will stop interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the atten@@ u@@ ation of inflation have subdu@@ ed the spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will be &quot; contracts , &quot; when they kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy decision makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly annual rate of inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % , and warned that pressure on the household income would continue to rise , although inflation is likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years the interest rate would be necessary to instru@@ ct inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and said they would have to rise more than expected to the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a portion of the mamm@@ oth economy , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ ite .
it will require time for financing the financial plan to provide budget funding for banks , although it is predicted that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because pressure on the real income of households continued to wage consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain Stra@@ it of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cooling down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently predi@@ ct the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank , however , emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank predicted down@@ wards in the forecast for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the predicted forecast in May .
it maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell upon these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rates increase the rising expectations to a interest rate , and the GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover by the bank towards the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and slight limits , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing is still worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the loss of income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it added that wages in the end of their three @-@ year @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be considerably &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the economy is strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , which will be compens@@ ated for a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision was made a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August , following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the punishment .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgement of the Bank on interest rates , the reputation has increased after a interest rate , as inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decisions made an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation is fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them back over the coming months .
the Bank said that over@@ flow in relation to their target of 2 % may be &quot; quite &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the shortest response rate of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive because the len@@ ders want to finish heavily by shops and end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly suitable for those who run the existing De@@ als and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with extra @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) shall pro@@ strate HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will be given to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV @-@ prevention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against funding from September following a fight against the medicine in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse , pre@@ operative phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk @-@ risk issues by around 86 percent , now a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people is delivered .
he prepared to finance the trial , after the Court of Appeals in the last year had confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court according to which the N@@ HS had confirmed the decision to finance the local authorities in spite of the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
the chess statement announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England , Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to join the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to all England in April 2018 .
pre@@ operative phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV @-@ preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that P@@ EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission in risk of infection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent any HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question for the treatment , pregnant or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have an partners whose HIV status will not be known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who are registered in England and registered in a domestic doctor may also register for possible participation in their local volunteers .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medic@@ ations in this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study is intended to assess the complete potential of Pr@@ EP by adding clinical evidence , as it is specifically designed and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the most advanced and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in which more than three decades of persistent progress is one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in combat against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted to satisfy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not with a partner is subject to improve many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be made sure that the study will quickly run throughout the country and that no one who has left an risk of HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP test medicine was developed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Sha@@ dows of Health , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP trial is to be welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and after months .
the evidence show how transformed this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transfer of these li@@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
life Life : mezzanine and cle@@ arer designers @-@ tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for property , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have love me in them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a separated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to have high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home which was not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
fan had to be creative to solve the pre@@ set .
&quot; the steel works is fairly complicated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were stacked up to each other without having to don@@ ate us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t just enough to build a simple platform , but to put the steel that he had the right height below or below . &quot;
this layout allowed the fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down across the glorious living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of spi@@ ders plays an role in the execution of theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ red units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering started in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the fan of the st@@ alls , vene@@ ered or MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , very easy to guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in an ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agents will occur and will carry a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space , and to use high @-@ quality materials that provide the space of their luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and they are helping to create an emotional relation in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electric sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be changed with a good design and increased square footage of something standard and can be turned into something completely .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide who do not leave them .
brothers fighting for a 500 million US real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the largest real estate empire Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business is to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 property has collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded there and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in property , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the town centre , the development of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburb .
after an agreement with her deceased father , Colin - was described as &quot; main operator and the predomin@@ ant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a judicial review says that Colin property has owned a value of € 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of property and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Colin proposed re@@ distri@@ butions have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday after several failed attempt on Friday .
the brothers also strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - of which Colin claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but raises Paul in front of managing some owners in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to dev@@ ise the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails , and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , P@@ it@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading legal lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ences from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the col@@ ing@@ wood @-@ property , opened in Colin the first Je@@ un@@ loading of the family .
Colin says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hopes to pass her property to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to end the brothers before judgment , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is group of companies , with Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul tells about the conditions of their financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made herself back very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member , and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated in Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and its lawyers in contact with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
only Colin answered by the SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t tell much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain and to compl@@ ain with our family names &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the judgment that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father had not dar@@ ed that Paul and I would like to end up in our current dispute , &quot; said he and added that he was still a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff plans to restri@@ ct the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , participated in his first working day with executive employee , he set up a main problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps white House which he rep@@ airing , bad information given into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the employees that information about him should be flowing - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ n@@ osis does make sense , but others have tried to nar@@ rows tr@@ ump to monitor its media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is at the White House , its TV show is still strong .
&quot; if a candidate was re@@ ta@@ xed because of an un@@ fair reporting it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against politi@@ co .
politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it is under control , according to the six ex campaign officials , there is to ensure that his personal media has a continuous lob@@ Prize . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps has ever been under control , is ri@@ di@@ culous .
perhaps these campaigns do not know what we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could still contain more ignition fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the Twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
when his staff ad@@ mits to it a couple of times , trouble of him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump of tr@@ ams .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House composed of competitive parties always try to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material that may also promotes their views of the world .
politi@@ co - worked with this history - reported information on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors , the president of strategic reasons for strategic reasons .
this was an example , described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former female servants say that tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press releases , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he turns out to find out where these originate from .
exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone was willing to acc@@ use a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a heap at his Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
even though Johnson had been banned from Twitter being banned from Twitter , or that he has no concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations and rev@@ oked it in the past .
he has read the article and began to question employees over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ maker added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; attempted to implement a system in order to manage and document the tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove the most effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us but tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still strive to affect influence .
this essential factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ searched crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hoped .
the police in all of Europe ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als at the run .
since the ad@@ ress of the requested s@@ words are not known to be well @-@ known , references from the population will be hoping to pray .
Euro@@ pol was reported on Friday from the promotion based on the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent Calendar of winter .
the experience could have shown that many whis@@ per@@ ately in vacation rentals , the name of the Euro@@ pol was the part of the Euro@@ pol .
21 postcards of 21 EU countries have compiled 21 postcards from the 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online songs have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them were due to the release on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a gra@@ bs and return back to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of West mid@@ lands are back again with some escaped trav@@ ellers on the foot of the war , which had been negotiated by the municipality in front of their man@@ ors in front of their man@@ ors .
the travelers have their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street from Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; million@@ th row . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and a Army of transp@@ orts after they were first cast out in May , without having been dis@@ ma@@ yed out of the council in order to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ full group found a gap in the defensive systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ ob@@ stru@@ cted to find a way .
ra@@ ging residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; they were drawn there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley Heath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced to implement in fact when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May , and were moved back now .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move by doing long sub@@ missions in order to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my statutes , if the Council cannot stop once . &quot;
a local people who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ di@@ culous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ ellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have increased this time and one has seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we sei@@ ze the necessary legal steps so as soon as possible .
in order to support our awareness , it is very important that as many local residents indicate a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
this is wearing a picture of the situation , in which the court must check when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is celebrated .
the house at the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof , due to the time ambi@@ ance of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , by the end of April 2014 , approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost per year and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic upward numbers of refugees , which came to the County , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rat@@ a hotel as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the positioning of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt @-@ Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and said that time from serious interested parties in the house .
he was to keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ park with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to go back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof already have been standing building containers before the entrance , and if you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation projects are made .
the floors were pulled out , blan@@ kets per part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs out of the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large outdoor shower , the input field is re@@ designed , the new window will be installed .
everything was later called &quot; nice bourgeois @-@ near , &quot; like Thomas Sch@@ erer .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you can not position on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but st@@ resses on a high @-@ level downtown level .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approx . 60 rooms , can be regarded as broad .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
discussions with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the investments in the capital , Thomas Sch@@ erer did not want to set up exactly .
almost under a million euro , he calcul@@ ates .
the outdoor facilities are also taken on the front side , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open from the restaurant , which is open to public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ aires : US Special Off@@ ers make Grand Jury
in the Russia affair by U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special exhibition by Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have an so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under vocation with the job .
the newspaper says the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
CN@@ N was reported , there is already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps El@@ er@@ em son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted specifically to the Presi@@ dential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were dis@@ agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps Ele@@ mental team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are expected to vote in the election campaign as an advisor to the Republi@@ can .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special er@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally was caught in the center and have the pre@@ h@@ let down whether the President may im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair .
the main task of Grand lawyer &apos;s mission is to check and decide the evidence in possible off@@ ences and decide whether he should be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys will therefore also be called together .
most of them are turned on when it concerns larger and controversial cases .
the procedure will always be behind closed doors .
in addition , the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to download persons for the hearing .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called , and called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the conversation .
right experts said on Thursday night on Thursday evening in the US television that it does not show that Mu@@ eller should not break out in his work , and that it should be necessary to do quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on by the end to decide on the survey of an accus@@ ation .
however , the position of the office at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as the campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the theme will give the demo@@ crats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he doesn &apos;t know anything from the position of a Grand Jury .
but this work is usually in sal@@ ted , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agency on &quot; fair &quot; wise . &quot;
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
however , Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this ration@@ ality , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump were no@@ isy , he had to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him a position of investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is based on an investigation under great pressure .
according to a representation of US media , the White House collected material against the exceptional items and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
unlike an independent special issue of Congress like in the Water@@ gate affair around the later President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has a position where he could be fired by the President of the Department of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
on Thursday , two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators were dismissed on Thursday , after which the special players could not be released .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , Antar@@ cti@@ ca in the Antar@@ ctic
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has solved just about seven times the size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was the cer@@ eb@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the total distance of one trillion tons , and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , will now turn to the north and probably will need two , three years until it is melted .
with its 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant researchers registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people does not work out of him .
how much the climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice age , is un@@ clear to research .
however , since about 30 years , there has been a series of unusual cl@@ ot@@ ters of iron pipes in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ ten@@ se background .
according to many researchers , this could be coupled with global warming .
the broken col@@ oss was so far from the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is floating on the sea and is fed by large glac@@ iers .
consequently , it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this castle was the equilibrium of juni@@ per and ab@@ rupt a few years ago .
a complete sc@@ am is falling down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edge has never turned back as far as at present .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and could be broken if a piece is cut off .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ ses@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and ice so much water as it arises after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the shar@@ k causes the glacier directly to the ocean and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small measure , the British research project writes to the Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located according to A@@ WI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers , the fourth largest gravel base of the Antar@@ ctic .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural look and does not make any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists were disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now return or backward , his colleague has Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but these developments will last decades .
even if this researcher did not lead this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , so in recent decades there are still very many ice @-@ el@@ bows on the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
this long finish of the Antar@@ ctic is in South America .
according to the data of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has been heated over the past 50 years by around three degrees , thus the temperature in which the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U aims at a personal rate when personnel
because it is getting more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U calls to join the employer &apos;s employer in order to become more attractive .
just a short time before the summer break , 41 new jobs have gone through the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applications were expected to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to work personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment , there are currently under 50 positions at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
these include doctors and engineers , as well as forces of the general administration .
the CD@@ U would now take the initiative to take the initiative and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG from the administration of skilled workers .
according to the wishes of the parties &quot; management , the management will develop a concept for personnel and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements to skilled workers , but to future @-@ oriented applications .
the overall concept should look inside and orient@@ ated concrete measures for cross @-@ ups and include an exemplary offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this has already been listening to a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you did not know earlier so far .
other cities advert@@ ise good civil servants and employees and provide more attractive weather conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees , which leave the disease or age from the service .
the highest time to action thus , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter Peoples , president of the CD@@ U , went out with his party even beyond the joint application .
he had long been a surprise in the delivery time for a thick surprise when he publicly presented the personal cost of personnel in question , and the other parties b@@ loss@@ oms .
nations wants to verify that all the possibilities will be reviewed , which enable a withdrawal from the municipal employer association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration should also arrive with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - such as peoples &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the CD@@ U tries to pay attention to the employees and officials , as it is actually looking for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , increases or more money , if one changes in a higher level , oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prost@@ itutes law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy f@@ avo@@ red the sound to NGO migrants rescue rescue
in Italy , NGOs that use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea have warned that they are not able to continue their operations , if they do not want to keep new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said the Minister of Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organization &apos; Youth B@@ et &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express themselves in the course of the Italian state @-@ wal@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so , we &apos;re very sorry that we can operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement to the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess the alle@@ g@@ ations that are currently collected , after we have collected all information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; youth rescue &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew of din@@ gh@@ y migrants will take on board , which are supplied directly by men &apos;s hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off , so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast guards , the rescue service in the zone from humanitarian grounds and not out of any other moti@@ ves .
under the conduct of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must be aboard a Italian police officer who monitored their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been willing to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules as unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; fundamental changes or Dis@@ abilities &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel prize @-@ winning Do@@ ctors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants attemp@@ ting to retreat in Italy after the rescue measures occurred within the last weeks , that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants attemp@@ ting to reach these countries in hope .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine We@@ il@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Trieste and sights .
three friends guides were available .
the accommodation in the juni@@ per Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ undy and W@@ einf@@ alls of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michael &apos;s chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed observation points , partly at towers , some of which could be seen far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing planes .
there were always more asc@@ ents for the long trium@@ phs in between .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ market .
again the look@@ out point to look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wery &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and immig@@ rant , welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ mos@@ ed the Sole in the free@@ u@@ ft@@ in@@ hal@@ ation healing Sole .
also Neustadt has been controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 m of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from his best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn and Bundesliga . for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars in the future with computer consoles , instead of turning through the wind and weather about the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long been long to a serious economic sector , become an lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included .
this is also known in the first federal aver@@ ages that are increasingly committed to engage in this area .
the start of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals to the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; we hope to in@@ spire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Board of Directors Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is secure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this move there are still some clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA held in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke und Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been an agency for virtual foot@@ b@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must be dealt with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds among the fact that young people go into the stadium &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 52 year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the attempted to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ Sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be more often present more often on these markets than just once a year to send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
at the E @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation FIFA on competition level .
long ago , as in normal sports , lights have long been established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Olympics , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
for many , the performance is safe ordinary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bers also has been dealt with the question apart .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions , which you can find in classic sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress re@@ actions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; the exact player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bers also see problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is getting more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to run on online gaming , and in the scene the structures of the classic Sports .
the scientists empha@@ size the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the way internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural inhibit@@ ors .
a study by the consultancy firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , this is little .

Michelle Carter due to the texts that Conrad Roy had committed suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind g@@ aps and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced to Conrad Roy in June because of negli@@ gent kill@@ ings by Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is barren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter intended to stay free until appeal .
it had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream coloured bl@@ use , Carter worked with tears in the eyes , folded in the eyes , folded in the eyes and in the eyes as they were condemned .
&quot; her actions were killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the State Court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has not taken responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible things that they regre@@ t@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her mentally illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the promised that there is no day , in which I do not mourn the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain which we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they would never be persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that they will never take part in the wedding of their brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no more to have this one person , with which I was together since my birth a day , is a pain , whom I will keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a righ@@ tly preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit others to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mono@@ po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case moved national attention to itself after car@@ ding text releases are revealed that they encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hung on , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent her death in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the eye before his suicide : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All that you have to do is to switch to the generator , and you will be happy and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter visited him through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press by the case .
the case has dealt the legal opinion .
in addition to the few that Carter defended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced to Italy for murder in 2007 , was acquitted when she was acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment on the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern is entrusted to the Con@@ ve@@ yor Cup winner a great season - extra motivation will not hurt .
something that was different at his place in the cabin , I saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made himself the shared bin@@ ds to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ ve@@ yor Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the single stand could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the signs of the coach as well .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in the youth play@@ ers , de@@ but@@ ants , and just from the holiday of experienced professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guide , but he was chosen .
sugar is distributed among those who want to make a lot more neutral to whom you want to keep in mood .
those who have chosen to enter the inheritance of L@@ ame can only use small extra motivation .
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to take responsibility as a player : &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as a mini @-@ lame on the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ d in the arm did its rest .
and in all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start@@ up information such as the one that can take the ru@@ der also best into the hand .
he gave orders , attempted to direct the tro@@ upe tro@@ upe .
he had the sight for the whole , while many others were busy themselves .
Vid@@ al therewith to play its lack of fitness ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches sent out to link the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ks too only ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver to aband@@ on their first performance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not negative .
this is very good after all .
Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the bri@@ gade , both ag@@ inated sovereign .
the well @-@ known Napol@@ i storm was badly damaged , but also in the game up he tried a few times .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave the fact that the result was &quot; not so , as we hoped that . &quot;
but also he showed an ordinary performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game storage , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fetched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ used this Bayern @-@ world is still available for re@@ processes , one saw the game to the game .
Rud@@ y for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , was not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i decided after a few cr@@ ushing statements in the back of his new fellow players .
there he heard of sweet@@ ness an interesting set : &quot; what happens here I &apos;ve already noticed .
with Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one .

company content with Rheinland @-@ pf@@ ast@@ ical Minister : Economy Pra@@ ise Wis@@ sings tempo
it was often un@@ conc@@ ili@@ atory that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still economic minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old Minist@@ ries .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Fine Arts ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing pra@@ ises the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the largest revers@@ er can see Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au represents now at the priority list of the country .
even this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning process , until 2021 , the building should be quite right .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the western part of Trier , which is on the main road map .
the objective is to take into operation the route in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ man Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional but internationally competitive enterprises .
industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) aims to increase as bis@@ sing of Wis@@ sing , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing an open ear for people who want to establish a company , commends the Chamber of Commerce .
the Trier Bar Association holds up an additional inc@@ entive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says General Manager Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is intended to make a premium of 1000 Euro for the advanced championship testing and 2500 Euro for graduates within ten years after their master training .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country will remain long .
at the planned road construction , it may be possible to create facts , at the same time , the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Bell Tower , the main managing director of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the scientists want to set mobility in state operations , have only been occupied by 29 places until now .
the Chamber is required to receive more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ Group vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of calcul@@ ator , in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receipt of regional roads as proposed .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us is still expecting a concept of the country how it wants to fix a skilled worker in the region .
sober@@ ing is further to the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had evaluated the power supply in a Chamber of Commerce only with a note of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about gr@@ asp@@ ing internet connection and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April in order to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - after four months , they already dra@@ fted the field .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers are faced with a counter reaction .
one day before the announcement of Audi said , BMW said that it would be able to update the software into more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ chair said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent options &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where BMW is based on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or restri@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will be able to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observ@@ ance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ its diesel engines apply as a car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ous and can cause As@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , equipment for neutr@@ alis@@ ing of diesel vehicles em@@ itted exhaust gases , also take to what it makes it difficult to competitive the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of to ignore the powerful car companies and to ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called dow@@ alt devices that could regulate emissions if a car has been tested , but at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were indicted , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be placed in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities were accused of having a system installed to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could be extremely difficult : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los B@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laugh@@ ter against the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was part of one of the most widely published cartoon animation , the buttons of his figures are the trademark .
also at 85 , the Argent@@ ier still features a film and works on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for happiness cards - what fru@@ str@@ ated him fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ ier day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 60 &apos;s , the breakthrough came with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
again the artist was inspired by the cities .
great , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
on the early morning , he is still sitting on the cartoon animation , and works almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches are continued to find a lot of pre@@ valence worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any other animal in its drawings - which has a thou@@ s@@ ler as a counter .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that should come to the chin @-@ up in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
for this reason , he is rather reli@@ ed on the TV series , which is how his original drawings will be produced .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence from climate Change threatened
he became a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions of drought stored conditions and due to the disease @-@ transferred insects , some scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the research institute , CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to impacts of climate change in the past years , who brought much more rain in spring and in the fall much more .
this has effects on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , called the d@@ warf @-@ zi@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not just for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lack of missing or weakened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered to be considered are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant to dry resistant resistant .

the assassination of a journalists under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet , in order to verify their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ hearing drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what to feel safer : they are to take their children to the office , who were the aim of an attack with gren@@ ades , or at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abdom@@ inal .
there are drug gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , which are suspected to stand on the list of the list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that are dangerous to the chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest of the violence , and during the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , there are always more journalist : at least 25 , since then President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to put his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are still seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter , her editor and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his central finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , hangs t @-@ shirts on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters show T @-@ shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panama .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared subjects , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal Prosecutor has been established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists .
as with the majority of thousands of mur@@ ders , who are connected every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organic crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers are rarely judged by journalists .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still exist to treat the force of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ tr@@ ater@@ ally and even though the terrain is still in stock .
without information about the murderer , without justice , the meeting on discussion of security , is not a little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; we don &apos;t know that why we don &apos;t know the why . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twelfth river . &quot;
the support went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ les@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ is@@ ating fra@@ ctions will struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that anyone who are shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people on the streets are shot or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey ap@@ ol@@ een for drug royal which are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el control on the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ under@@ standings have contributed to the murder .
in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ents of cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have the children disp@@ leased , presumably gang@@ members bought each copy of the edition , as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was in it , Val@@ dez did not force to force , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same history to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as a experienced repor@@ ter to the Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce foundation in 2003 and sold 50 USD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to maintain journ@@ alism , without falling to the noise of noise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper had served a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest coverage , and the sales and the advertising .
repor@@ ter loved it , hard tre@@ ff@@ ing examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could be treated .
eight years after the formation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead them .
he voluntarily gave himself that he had anxi@@ ety .
&quot; I want to continue on the CP@@ J award at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stup@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the sight of many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team has been missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a harbour workers , who was gener@@ ously with Ukrain , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he always would go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and there always sit on the same table .
now ask them , was his love for routine doing his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own interests in question how they do their work in the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their children , their children , their little shops , their home and landing run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ breeding and self @-@ accounting .
trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells false , lead away .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; od@@ our of a sense can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative jewell@@ ery , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones permitted . days before , Spyware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside sought two polic@@ emen from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ class building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , who gave the governor themselves as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape , where the drugs are de facto standing in control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has been baked on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a pos@@ é to the State &apos;s spending , which focused on the home town of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug hands and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned about public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) that ruled the whole century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i governors were accused of up@@ loading cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the repor@@ ter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this location , including one in whom a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best inform@@ al source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; due to its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s Office was devoted to the storage space for signs and sticker to protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become too little for themselves , what they would never expect : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalists to the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists have become stronger , as they wrote in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walking routes and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone into Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the Val@@ dez &apos;s case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to send and destroy journalists , because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is again divided by the government , because she wor@@ ried that her anger has injured her objective .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organis@@ ational crimes , involved in government officials and an equal society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ter could not only be killed by drugs but also on orders of politicians and security forces with the organised crimes under a ceiling .
last year , the &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; media group has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want that you hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a horri@@ ble effect .
no one forget the death of the blo@@ g@@ ant Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ li@@ p@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern boundary of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents of Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ va Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed to the drug store with a control article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ dently the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives that the drug store is troubled at him .
&quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the ed@@ itors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , as at once all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began .
a series of shooting paintings with band@@ age and security forces near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues on how it has been promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding edge of the board , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who held the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they had anxi@@ ety at all , they did not show it .
under the powerful portrait of the fallen green of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you remember , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day when Javier murdered , the intern@@ ship asked me to send them on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to depart from his enemies
the first look looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have found that the first findings of the incredible h@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even determine that his gloves were skin of red@@ dish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they said they would have had something from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uncertain past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology , &quot; designated him as &quot; the held arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered type of cam@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his incredibly good good condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ge@@ ared plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , green .
he met on something that appeared from the surrounding rock on the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more precisely .
the Fos@@ sil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have blin@@ king only a little with eyes , you could almost believe that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs issues - Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a ru@@ ction and resembles a changing shell , probably threatened by meat @-@ fres@@ co@@ din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves before pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ cre@@ mation that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix himself better into its surroundings and to leave his enemies , experts say that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now able to see at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ edly after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ chni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour about his body .
they discovered the sha@@ ded sha@@ ded , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the sha@@ dy is usual , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs f@@ aded enough pressure by meat @-@ e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the con@@ frontation ensu@@ ed as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the cra@@ vings - think of R@@ ehe , Zeb@@ ras or hip animals - are much smaller and hurt as a prey , which indicates that this cam@@ dos@@ ages was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly bent Din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ dents have been the chal@@ k time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows also that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was brown .
researchers continue to examine the animal on his life , including his con@@ voy , to find out what it did as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died , when he died , fell into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South African today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ centric circles , but also remains in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the beast today looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
they do not need a lot of imagination to re@@ design it . if you &apos;re just a little bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vo@@ cal din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth passed through .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus was born in Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this is part of the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was rec@@ ted after death in the sea and sw@@ apped in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada , green .
according to the museum , it is the be@@ ster@@ ili@@ ated din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and armour , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ced from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pump@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was weakened by the Western Canada through a flooded river it was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the rem@@ n@@ ated remains of this special specimen are so good that the hood can still cover hol@@ dings along the din@@ osau@@ r along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ ving so rare as a profit in lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it .
hidden remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ lows in the sk@@ ull , which carry the shafts of the animal .
his right foot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ dly on the A8 : many injured
fierce accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kil@@ ns @-@ long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured in the afternoon of Thursday morning at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first data of the police , between the connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 cars , including lor@@ ries , are likely to be inter@@ connected .
there were no information about the exact number of publ@@ ishers at first .
it &apos;s mild to moderate serious injuries , said a police post .
a big boost to rescue vehicles was at the accident place .
the A8 was closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a round of approximately ten kilometres was formed .
like a AZ repor@@ ter , it was also on the opposite way to massive Dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fire Brigade noted the mark of the vehicle hand@@ leb@@ ars , who now have to count with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs a second accident occ@@ ured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
in the process it was come to a coll@@ ision between a car and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : company test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
when the Schaff@@ ner comes and raised an unclean way or take the ride in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently the most expensive bicycle control .
it is simply confirmed by phone that one has taken his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
at present there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is where we produce it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one track spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called the Train of the ticket services without a conductor .
however , in order to be able to use some requirements , a smartphone or tablet needs to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what did most passengers do to do .
you also have to have bought it via the app by train , DB &apos;s Navigator , which is the most convenient way for the ticket office .
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : if you go to the train , his ticket is calling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test results , a button will appear to the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train att@@ endant on their mobile devices have a message that the g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
comes the train conductor at rank Y at rank Y he knows that there is a passenger with already available online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the rail@@ ways , which is to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket control through our train staff , check in the DB &apos;s Navigator itself .
this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often goes way , knows that by delay and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest stum@@ bling events .
because often , in any case , one of the travelers don &apos;t need any documents in any case , which one needs to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or personnel identification is either a document that you have to have .
the consequence are endless discussions between train att@@ endant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the crash or greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time to worry about other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and it is also possible to take the connections to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and the ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further pulling numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken up to their core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
you are proud of a mail from somebody from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one had posted information on her feed , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Par@@ o@@ ah has continually been placed on the tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ e from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officers in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns animated body , which was stretched out on the road and would stay four hours there .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; says Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she made her mobile phone to go to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later on the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos from the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ ons Police only killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live @-@ feed where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she claimed that another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell ten@@ se to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and we can call ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt Schüt@@ tel@@ em@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you book a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , in cinemas from 11 .
it is a story of survival and prot@@ ector , love and loss , the strength and power of resistance , which consists of the visibility of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell passed with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ li@@ flower and a suitable crown after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , they spoke the two a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning , &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black men have to fight for that which they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are now going to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police murdered a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and will see it up in it .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organisation , but also know the different shifts of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I have lucky enough to give you an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ ond rac@@ ism , she is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would show you a bad service , to keep them far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police office which became a camp site , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter are connected with local business partners , who made lunch .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ves , on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to assume a new type of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my acti@@ vism changed dramatically after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ se Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organization .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell hit Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening , one of the film co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comra@@ des Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to document &quot; what happened .
a question came Fer@@ rell to the sense : &quot; want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by thousands of people , often of White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
following the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vism to death by to@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on fer@@ rel@@ ing experience - to show that it concerns the movement &quot; not around a Messiah leader , but to a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ les life , how she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the refin@@ ement of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ing &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black pregnant women in the wider black @-@ lives mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have influenced the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identi@@ fies the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , pregnant women must wear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a common type of action , &quot; where Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the movie .
&quot; she was the person who shook up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was in front of the front , because with a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , pregnant woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel the energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social affairs of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ung to a voc@@ als and she feels himself , since they went to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on &apos;s road three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our liberty .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose , except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern edge of the pedestrian area dep@@ rec@@ ated the population since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold is hardly possible on the subject .
the subject is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; theme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ bit gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Ro@@ ads ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or plain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the fears make sure that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , including the other shops , the enemy fears that then the pedestrian street is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds , on which the farm market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
the construction work is concluded with the beginning of the construction .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building , namely to Bed@@ a place , with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the farmer market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farms always very happy again .
we have also discovered the but@@ cher@@ y for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would desire that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other cities there is that too .
above all the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether a direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new project should probably be rather low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; why shopping ar@@ est in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ y@@ - or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous thing .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all more important to keep us at least the market hall .
because after all the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is ob@@ tains inexpensive .
as one sees , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because the dor@@ man@@ ors are often not portable for one re@@ ta@@ iler .
too bad , special shops there are almost no more and that which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall set during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ KA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery actually comes .
or creates it a bit @-@ gallery to distribute all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it &apos;s easy to work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the mad@@ ness many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the peasant market hall is made , a piece of culture becomes disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ explic@@ able - which hang on the ceiling of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ stream and Haar@@ gles which were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the earlier intelligence analy@@ tic analy@@ tic ker@@ at@@ ched a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison after she was publicly admitted to the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ ellers ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed to their professional compet@@ ency in technology , computer sciences and art , and man@@ ing , a transit and pioneering disp@@ leased , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could look like someone with these genom@@ ic data , such as someone can be interpreted using these genom@@ ic data - the many ways such as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ants of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to the identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been openly spoken about the identification as woman , in 2013 he was convicted of 20 accus@@ ations , including six bre@@ aches against the sp@@ y Act , computer , and theft .
through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one piece of grain - a grain , black @-@ white car@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in bl@@ onde per@@ es - which was associated with them .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg returned from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic Ar@@ te@@ facts like cigarette ligh@@ tening and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it , like these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , therefore they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sent to un@@ equal letters , who had taken several letters in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Can@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; supple@@ mentary images , &quot; which had predicted a future in which President Chel@@ ci@@ als would convert , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , who would like to release man &apos;s release in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there are also some depth at the opening of the exhibition at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the governing camp and against transfer@@ ring forces to find new , twe@@ eted ways to move the rigid bo@@ oting , which he actually wanted to remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for all these things , she said that &quot; things come from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for man@@ tle with her superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic breaks , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of C@@ s and Gs and As described in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hope to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ is@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) how amazing similarly , at least in biological respec@@ ts , we all are .
&quot; what people do hopefully will bring with me is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Spur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one page from the above mentioned com@@ ic Nov@@ els mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how it appears with a free release in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ch@@ ill your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist that greet you from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition even personally - as it was expected to have taken away in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room from their own genom@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ren , who collabor@@ ated like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
that was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , in which the genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ins were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it at the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement feels like a mass movement , like the movement , which also stuck behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professor of the University of North@@ western and a member of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford which , as susp@@ ects , sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , on Monday , Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several engra@@ vings .
a warning system by the Chicago police station states that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call on the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared the place of action for the dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said civil servants .
since 2007 , La@@ ender has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President for college relationships , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ ender must now be judged and be excluded from the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College spoke in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to be that he turned himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he needed the susp@@ ect of the susp@@ ect to set up the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Police has a presentation of its position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
in Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police received a call from the building ste@@ ward of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just got a rare tip , the promised that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very bitter@@ ly .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ender and War@@ ren were in building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and research@@ ed a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic precau@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timetable for the near future &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) is implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; says Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ installation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that would give occasion for an occasion for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future . &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the outcome of the investigation by the WA@@ DA through the Canadian attor@@ ney , Richard McLaren , to publicly accept D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has attached a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
mut@@ il@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point of R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v problems caused the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody wants to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA from the execution of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the organisation of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli announced that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be to become the next U@@ ber
Amy deliver@@ t wanted to measure the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not grie@@ ve the trial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was just never consisten@@ cy and objective , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said deliver@@ t who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Madison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wax to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
due to the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it allows companies to arrange special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ thal can allow to handle C @-@ suite executives and turn right to the board of Directors .
&quot; they have now tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; he said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start@@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analysis tools is used by companies to measure employees commitment .
deliver@@ t said that they think a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ Surve@@ ys and Surve@@ ys of certain Teams , it offers a heat card of the company which shows the majority of the complaints and which managers have low @-@ tuning results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you are not involved in the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale , who has been writing a blog post by a former employee who spoke a blog , where those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Company leaves tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; Surve@@ ys , confi@@ dential answers to real @-@ time and view the warmth cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , can report with the employees bad behavior .
and when the main business leaders is involved , complaints will go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the judgment of public opinion has recorded the reg@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or is ir@@ eth@@ ical , there may experience expensive consequences due to consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and process and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ t sets out , problems that were sitting in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ dening or un@@ fair practices - faster and addressed .
&quot; I can come closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano that leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in advance of employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take eth@@ ics , values , and employee commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies did not prevent that their dirty laundry went online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well Conver@@ t offer your software as a service , and uses the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find venture capital investors who have both supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than expected to expect more than before .
there are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley .
the employees want the feeling that you accept and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to feel in a company , feel their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Deb@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which both Conver@@ t as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when its portfolio companies are well run . companies are running good when employees are fighting and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools of third parties speak , commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employees commitment after the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company does not take action .
indeed , when a company asks people after your feedback , it can have a anticip@@ ation that the change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this cannot motiv@@ ate this dis@@ appo@@ intments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of yourself ?
and whom you don &apos;t care about why should I do ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly survey surveys , was able to enter action on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , deliver@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize several teams within the company and to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the staff , and it hopes that on a long view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high revenue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , you will lose the company .
the N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practition@@ ers and makes a long day for the break@@ ins
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ players will talk on a site of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their faces and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the water football center on the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real tre@@ t@@ mill for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and she has indeed extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
that &apos;s why the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the players already fully packed .
the compromise of the two days is more than a day , to which the break@@ ins start the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play times in West@@ wood tests carried out practical exercises .
they are going to hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal play preparations for their starting point against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ score the control of N@@ CAA support even if they add a further point for the number of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply have pushed it through , they are plac@@ eable , they are great people .
I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices , as soon as the camp is terminated , considering the clear view lines of its fields of a adjacent car and the neighbouring Lus@@ kin center , a hotel of up@@ scale grade , which is already mounted with foot balls , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task .
breaking players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a is that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not great to think that people rent a room there and then set aside to draw a exercise there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video image from a exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t make a great concern for me .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ ake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with folding reports to third parties and their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognise possible detection messages , and to send them to the fact that may display results of the fact test from the original articles .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points of f@@ ake points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many believe that they also have influenced the US Presi@@ dential elections in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political topic , with French voters being flooded in May with false stories , and Germany also supports a plan , according to social media networks , if it does not succeed to eliminate heat @-@ filled post@@ ings as before elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the knowledge of fact that stories from the fact that they will focus on third parties , people want to read and share decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product man@@ ag@@ onist for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to continue its feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conjunction with articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes on its news @-@ feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a viol@@ inist for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced a turbul@@ ent story of his cozy headquarters in the Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ em@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it is so beautiful to look at the manuscript of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says he is in mind .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; surrounded the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ dges May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos;@@ Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acts on the thum@@ bs on the side of a letter that was written by a double bed in the 1700 &quot; s that he worked for Jacob &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b of thum@@ b !
and letters always sm@@ ells smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect when he himself was also involved .
Ah , I love archive ! &quot;
for someone who is defeated so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have received my welcome drink a little . &quot; ) everything seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; Castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and cour@@ ages of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena creatures on walls and bottles that have spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the grounds and the ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke to land stain@@ s , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last creation , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the staff only started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ o@@ crats said &quot; Oh that described it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ta@@ w@@ cher , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , those who had : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could mean that land spar@@ ks would be bor@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let &apos;s go every step ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to invite the wider base to the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant base of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Fam@@ ilies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peasant standing in this area started and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , that told the history of the Jesu@@ it patent , hidden the family of Dar@@ rell seven years in the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , presented in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell given from the 18th century , filled his own fun@@ eral , filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his sar@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be able to be able to spend their debt , and spend money for things that they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men dis@@ sol@@ ves their school crises . I set it to me as a heap of well @-@ looking men , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot;
by the end of his engagement in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique write @-@ experience experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ ri@@ k@@ m@@ k@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been re @-@ called by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be finished with the condemned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf over 300 years old
with the aband@@ on@@ ment of the 301 years old Mari@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for introducing a new roof @-@ mark ( circuit of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team have to keep the logo and slogan home to Nelson Mand@@ z .
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of this promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make sure that everything is better than it seems .
basically , we are the fixed conviction that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is going to go by more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single standing promise that gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they are standing in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount can be found in the city of Bad Honnef its new roof mark and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear in front of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about retirement and grants in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week also .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice @-@ mier@@ s as well as the Minister for Defence , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ count .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
general Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , the Russian Government of King Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and arist@@ o@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections for the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the P@@ utsch@@ er .
against 4@@ 86 people who have participated immediately in the coup attempt , this week is being negotiated in Ankara in this week .
even on the day after the coup d Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; God &quot; gift , as he gave him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces . &quot;
but did Erdo@@ gan really handle the army in ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general rule , there is concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army that mani@@ f@@ ests among others in the re@@ vocation of the ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s ban for Sol@@ dat@@ as , wrote the newspaper .
the big pur@@ ification in the army and the security forces goes on any further .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent further 7@@ 395 heads of state feu@@ dal , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
at the same time it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan was t@@ apped up the military .
the gener@@ als are considered to be the real masters of the country .
three times they slip on their role as the gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan entered the power of the military step by step , not least under vocation to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , &quot; Erdo@@ gan was cast out specifically an Islam@@ ization of forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; named after the coup attempt to asylum from persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that NATO could not leave NATO .
however , in the alliance , there is a doubt of doubt of the application of the Turkish army in the alliance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managers and operational capabilities were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immig@@ rant plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it looks to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 a year , stri@@ ving rules for the planning of visa for temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will decrease poverty , saving the wages ten billion dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and will do this by the US will be issued by the citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains @-@ migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will get good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rolling the route for racing transportation
over the past few months , over the future of the racing driver had been fought - now it should go very quickly .
at the end of the year it is expected to be built on the mar@@ ches , which travel to the tourist path .
in order to secure the future of the racing driver &apos;s future , according to information from the German Ministry of Transport , the construction work continues to begin in the course of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order to order the route of Ilmenau @-@ racing platform , the country knows especially for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic secretary of Klaus Stra@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs approximately 2.5 million euros for the maintenance of the route .
of this sum , the land exceeded 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle service should also be ordered in the future by the country , will be approved at the moment .
the Ministry and Southern Tabl@@ ingen train as an operator shall be aware of the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the timetable , which are used for vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said coverage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society become closed for a period of eleven years .
this meant the racing platform shuttle to be ordered in December 2017 .
the platform shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations Ilmenau and Renn@@ weg .
in the course of a pilot plant in the past months , the distance of sufficient many people was used to receive them again regular in the future .
the distance is also heavily di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought , in 2017 it cannot be re@@ medi@@ ated , a new report about the technological developments in the area of having sex robots .
yes , in fact .
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for responsible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we need to start their rise seriously .
customers can choose the ey@@ ec@@ row of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people make themselves funny , but the companies provide a lot of it , and we will see them much more likely to see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said with the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed themselves of their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a sil@@ ica skin that feels warm , with conscious of human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his belie@@ fs &quot; and select all the colour of the robot on the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still troubled , as many robots would have the &quot; person@@ alities &quot; to look progressive in a step@@ ford @-@ woman .
modern s@@ add@@ s have developed to robots with a sil@@ ica skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they look like rel@@ ap@@ ing .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex with pre@@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ults and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality in which your personality is as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it has also its voting in the course of the day - quite as real people !
it can be tired to be fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many excited aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mitting female properties that play a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( name here : resi@@ sti@@ ble ) Far@@ rah is troubled , in@@ quiet one most .
in his website True Compan@@ ion of Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for males .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fat or just a different sex game .
their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ery show a little dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards having sex with sign@@ age as optional addition .
most men will naturally be unable to keep sex robots , and while FR@@ R is indicated its rising popularity , they still remain the pre@@ limin@@ arly on the outskirts of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ age from the mar@@ g@@ inal zones can be le@@ ak@@ ened in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very in@@ structive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting , until the free market gives permission to them .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are delayed in a time where the rights of women are threatened , in which there is a pre@@ sidents in the White House , who has hired women to attack women .
the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ s &apos; s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the worn bodies and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision is .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind this sex robots is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders wants to feel that they feel good , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to its &quot; person@@ alities , &quot; the robots are no real women .
they can not separate from their companion or go away .
they don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , what would mean to independence or anything , what the imag@@ ery could distur@@ b .
expressed differently : they are vanity slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : service ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the term of healthy human being
it has become an interest rate of the tr@@ ump era that the political strug@@ gles , which have polari@@ zed the US voters , have split families in small size .
around Christmas and Ern@@ est ank@@ fest there were in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with the hormone by Tr@@ ump of Tr@@ ump .
we all have rep@@ ell@@ ent to let our filter bubbles burst .
less noticed , the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families together .
I chose this because my cousin , a left @-@ gro@@ aning conducting in Chicago , has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unit can have a mighty enemy against a common enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including Republi@@ can kind@@ red , had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side .
in order to get the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also takes considerable risks associated with it .
the left hand has been strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the in@@ cum@@ ulative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ iness of the possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer be compens@@ ated for us .
there is yet another long @-@ time @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; suddenly appear in comparison to his standards suddenly as int@@ essence of distortion .
I find myself today by an active No@@ stal@@ gie for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ance novels - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we know how his tax expl@@ aining ) - both occur compared to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have to be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an unbe@@ ar@@ able improvement .
when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the biggest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p@@ y and the animals turn to watch full fear on their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a notable way .
so many cler@@ ks of a town dis@@ appo@@ inting : the views of high buildings are being old , the Sky@@ lines are to be familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not be justified by the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite out of the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topics pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a large roundabout at the north of London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one has asked .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card .
in coffee at the corner of my street there is the same , plus the option to compens@@ ate with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the Lad@@ isch .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also practice pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation which is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store was bl@@ am@@ eless , while I tired the experience , you made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
in the past year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand@@ rails , which he suffered from prison according to a case in his prison cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted for murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , taking it several times through a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hidden himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are to be op@@ aque .
the National Council of Pro@@ sec@@ ution said that they would set up a claim by the Supreme Court of the South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the attor@@ neys are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ kl@@ ers from F@@ igh@@ s and ov@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the leading schools .
three of the kidn@@ apping students will go to gymn@@ asi@@ um , four at the secondary school .

after that , classes three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank showed a chicken balance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young tra@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders carried to the bet .
the Adler stand for the integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from the young k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish each four @-@ star fans , that he feels himself in his new school .
it followed Dan@@ st@@ word to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who once again jumps back at teaching positions , and the parents of the parents .
the chi@@ ken@@ ing time was over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons , for it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quad@@ r@@ kl@@ ers .
finally , all students have taken a song of summer time and holiday season .
it broke out with the children great joy .
eight first cl@@ amps have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people concerned must now know
how exactly does the software update takes place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or poor are exemp@@ ted from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE Auto Club Europe gives insights :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory update will only apply to vehicles that have chosen software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ arm@@ ament has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers have informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an excellent implementation in the next few months , but no exact date .
Daimler has informed that any person concerned .
if anyway , In@@ spec@@ tion is due , that will be done in the frame .
how long do the equipment take up in total ?
&quot; difficult to say &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the curtains from the engagement of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , we do not will@@ ingly act the automobile manufacturers on the subject of environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be , an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is av@@ eng@@ ed to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but to the regions , where bicycle is dro@@ wn .
in rural areas , there are no loss of losses for older diesel .
the ACE is av@@ eng@@ ed , with sales yet to wait .

we do the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ d , dates back to R@@ ente next year .
the site is already written - suitable applicants are however ra@@ r .
since 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ d .
and the work makes him still great fun as he gives in the Press interview .
he reports from varied but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , they wonder that no application will perform the profile profile .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time .
in this way - under the contemp@@ t of regular periods of notice , it is still enough time to elab@@ orate .
since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ building contractor , the applicant must report the corresponding financial statements .
because this function wants to keep the city on any case .
if she could not fill it out , the citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity of the city and him is important , says W@@ acker who reports from a good operational climate as well as good mood between the authority and citizens of the citizens .
in more than 30 years , some important projects have accumulated , on which the acker is looking back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is above the building office and his staff secure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are based on the agenda : the conversion of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the down@@ stairs park are be@@ ared .
the chin @-@ up bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium @-@ restoration is still subject .
the latter alone will propose to be@@ ech approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
design is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ d big game room .
with ha@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener &apos;s leather , many can be re@@ acted flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be much moving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ acker , and the design of green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors often . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have a eye for it , what it fits , &quot; when new@@ buildings are approved , st@@ resses the rigid Stadt@@ bau@@ d .
this is a high responsibility for the Stadt@@ bau@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is Bau@@ d , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes beyond my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on many years of long @-@ standing staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( underground ) for over 15 years .
even though his successor remains long , he wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the job . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating environment , but also for the further design of the city .

bike on lines are thrown : straight line blocked
according to the police , the so far unknown offen@@ ders had been on the track for the line of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged , that the risk of traffic had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male servants and look for the night hours after them .
near the place of Tat@@ a , a ro@@ sy sco@@ oters and bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ si@@ zing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the off@@ ender had brought themselves into great danger and also threatened by train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility as well as the delay and the delay of delay and the costs for rail goods traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be led without disabilities .
barely ten person@@ alities were held on Friday morning , two of them consider the public transport .
goods pul@@ ls did not differ , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 metres of Ober@@ n@@ ines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflamm@@ atory illness )
rotating meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflamm@@ atory diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States , causes mag@@ nets and bubbles , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the persons concerned are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immun@@ otherapy in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , that hide themselves in the food , do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells that are able to em@@ ulate inflamm@@ ation , are balanced of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissues .
when the equilibrium is too far in direction of inflamm@@ ation , it can result in an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory illness .
in experiments , experiments were found that a kind of tolerance handling immun@@ cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ien@@ art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ oma and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had their immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and a tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han nutrition toler@@ able to toler@@ ate less anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory intest@@ ine , if the same system also work with humans .
the Post@@ do@@ ctor in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was looking for a type of immun@@ o@@ aks when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated .
it assumed that the difference to the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us who normally live in the stomach intest@@ ines .
the mice of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment , causing them not developed a gut micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria rec@@ eded to the immune system , researchers painted L. re@@ uter@@ i in a liquid and then caused small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component is cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be known as a side @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han on the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 per cent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans toler@@ ate the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i will protect our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ products from L. re@@ uter@@ i can develop the cells in humans such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in humans with inflamm@@ atory disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells tend to control infections on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i to an extension of these population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; to Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United States signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , since the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season play before the UEFA Cup in real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impres@@ sively mar@@ ched into the old role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
but M@@ atic was excluded from the Prepar@@ atory Asia @-@ tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve the Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho starting at the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the kind as he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ a and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u is the Avi@@ va Stadium as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho set his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had another three new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four prime obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , thank you to the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the American Airlines Boeing has painted the Silhouette mas@@ lin@@ ers into the sky .
the pilots flew Seattle in the US state , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , that are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens it was to be the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was a stam@@ ina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo in heaven was painted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Low Budget for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind blows : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD , the Democratic Prime Minister of Ministers went up with a certain concern to Berlin , at the time of elections .
- No distur@@ bing from the party &apos;s central , naked wind @-@ wind from the Confederation - such as the most important desire of the election campaign .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , it has changed dramatically .
since then , the employees look at the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governed regional capitals .
what has been from there since the beginning of the year , with counter @-@ wind would not even be described in the approach .
it was deep envel@@ opes .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U is a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; this once more : red @-@ green is simply not able to reign , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber for the publishing network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fra@@ grant of a Green MPs has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has asked the dis@@ appearances of Lower Saxony @-@ dep@@ uties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return its mandate .
the trans@@ verse to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear delay of the choice of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal managing director and Ele@@ ction of the Green Party to the Federal Chancellor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ted a SPD @-@ election campaign , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was reached on Friday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the Green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ west to CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the Pre@@ liminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD federal associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the failure began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , sol@@ ving the comra@@ de of comra@@ de .
according to the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
but it became even worse - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the deaf , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party .
the comra@@ des pulled down again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just returned new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and the next step was with him .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in the crisis communication since then , in the crisis communication , everything was wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z figh@@ ts for his political survival .
now Stephan Weil am .
because of the VW @-@ gas engines and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism .
mi@@ ese change@@ over values came .
nevertheless , or maybe that &apos;s why , because in the past few weeks , Weil waited more strongly to set acc@@ ents in the alliance .
the re@@ lics of the former Mayor of Hannover , to expand his power in Berlin , was also not hidden in Martin Schulz in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him because they promised him because of the stab@@ ilization of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
in doing so , because of the part@@ ing internal ken@@ nel , the Lower Sax@@ on Green is not guilty .
and Schulz was not at all .
un@@ fold the comra@@ des therefore try to keep their own ranks .
their anger is stir@@ red up into the green , and here especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ment in the west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ ving , such as wife T@@ west their own career with interests about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the par@@ c@@ ures in the SPD Bundestag , the Federal Chancellor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not because of her person as director of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party , Ms. T@@ west has not been elected to Parliament on the national list of Lower Sax@@ on dep@@ uties .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Bundestag , compl@@ ained a &quot; democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters for four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil to minister &apos;s Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Sax@@ on SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of care@@ ers developed a future CD@@ U dep@@ uties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more information about the CD@@ U Lower Saxony has given .
funding for Local III
those who want to be restored in the years will soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g city development was started on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the event of the event , Sch@@ in@@ dler even gave a back view to the so far .
it has been in Emp@@ fingen san@@ itation areas since 1991 .
back then , in the San@@ re@@ area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the San@@ iting area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous san@@ itation are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote the interior development , and not only to include new areas .
on April 4 , the Information Technology Karlsruhe has received the information that it will give a san@@ itation area III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church .
how does a san@@ ction reserve now arises ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of all interests , to be rehabil@@ itated .
if necessary , the area boundaries could then be moved once again .
on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the Federation countries program &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
the core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of inner cities , improving the residential and working conditions and the expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would consist of objects , that is being carried out per plot .
finally , the san@@ itation area would eventually be established as a statute .
the con@@ sent@@ encing period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , once again the inventory would be carried out , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
as possible , in November or December , as soon as the pro@@ positi@@ onal casting should be made , so that coming year with the renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every municipality had to carry out pre @-@ studies .
it is therefore to evaluate the urban mis@@ st@@ alls and decide to decide when renovated and in what extent .
there will be also a memor@@ andum in the book for the particular property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after reception , and make a picture of the situation , and promised them .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a significant success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires which will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks , and will be completed by the end of summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it goes among other things about the building state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in grey questionn@@ aires , the &quot; household and housing bow , &quot; information on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if premises are operated in the building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since then , Got@@ zel pointed out that a back@@ fill questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new construction work are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ r Prin@@ ciple , &quot; who first comes , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
no funding can be made for later &quot; reservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ ner II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project were shown in order to make a moderni@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself has a micro@@ chip to come to home with a hand@@ held movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , his office and can even leave his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and poin@@ ter , and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ an@@ aes@@ thet@@ ist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant process is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology that starts when his hand is at the helm .
the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that emphas@@ ises the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the military , which were left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and director of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter was made in Connecticut next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ fts from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary course or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on South La@@ wn , after the records of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I wanted to make sure that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , the Deputy Commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for return flight .
during the course of the event , the entire flight crew was located at the helicopter , while the unit remained at the ground during the time on the plane .
the records made from the T@@ IME have not been clearly stated , whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohib@@ its Federal Committee to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds when you are sealed , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President announced a violation of the reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to establish the governmental regulation .
the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon , is scar@@ cely a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for the journey .
but their use only require a photo @-@ operation , is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation as the presidential airplane before the background of his first fighting g@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presi@@ dential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn , to susp@@ end the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to 58 practice sessions at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dential commis@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers could not have the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in writing the helicopter on South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ed drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ aries of the U.S. Department for the 2017 budget for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund set for the v@@ H @-@ 3D , but 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
record of unity recorded the flight time of a plane than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers fixed on the basis of estimates for funds , it is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a Rand study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not include the personnel costs , but also account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press release of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , has used the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that will be manufactured in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent .
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have ti@@ ring .
it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether tr@@ ump with the helicopter inter@@ ag@@ ated , when he entered his tour through the South of La@@ wn , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighters .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and joined the media on its own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky &apos;s very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
the top @-@ chief of the Second Tennis Bundesliga occurs at the standings of the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will stand in Kiel at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel , at the tab@@ le@@ eve of the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
despite five games still imp@@ ec@@ lec@@ tic balance has become the point of the Second Tennis Bundesliga as a sense for reality .
team Chef Mari@@ us Z@@ ay also has respect to the opponent at any time .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays always similar formation in quite similar formation .
I just find the team very good on the right position . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , the imports come from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Danish and Finn@@ s can even point to insert in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will always be difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city represents 46 kitchen aid
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita south side again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an order to the team .
in the urban nur@@ sery sites the clock is turned back .
on 1st September the City of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , Deputy Head of the Department of Art , is that good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
cooked is continuing to go out of house : a C@@ ater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 children at noon a warm meal .
in the last night year 2800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not only eating children who are cared for 45 lessons , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 Parti@@ al forces have served as of 1 September kitchen : they warm the delivered meals , supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the meal , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group @-@ group@@ ings as well as seven upper troops - decides about the circum@@ ference of the hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen all belong to the K@@ ita Team &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger and it is easier for the purpose of getting a simple and educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children are to help prepare meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force is meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - in addition to quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that they have exhibited in the cost of ownership and foreign trade for the city as the most economical , it says from the press office .
and even though 46 partial forces are set to be set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at around 750 people in the legal gu@@ ardian range , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , &quot; says the UN
elections can be only representative when all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are involved in the Council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women can not be estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and cre@@ dible , if women participate un@@ restricted and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published thre@@ ats against an election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting forces to a consult@@ ative role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be peaceful by a democr@@ atically elected government for the first time .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan @-@ independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women registered in a total of 3.6 million voters registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a long @-@ term commitment at managers of the Bis@@ c@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie with long @-@ term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said , the company remained silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ V@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ V@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be experienced when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the branch of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s appe@@ aled to &quot; concerns that the financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be powered . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity of the future needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members .
generations of families have worked here and the labour force focused strongly to the local community and the Great Glasgow , an important column for decent employment in a field of high unemployment and social discrimination .
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and in front of the background of the Bre@@ x@@ ite , the increasing life @-@ administration costs and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly ur@@ gently need a flour@@ ish production factor at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch of T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland last year , and the company will respond directly on it as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB of representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees we are like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business continuously check - and that applies to all of our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and quite an end . if our operation runs will change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G of Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the Side of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ atti
in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve his overhead tra@@ ps , but have warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record .
the sensational approach has hired the transit window in the summer because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United States last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athletes in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry with the way that N@@ ey@@ mar committed his way to outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans Board exists , that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago from the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 declared interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they touch one of our players , then we will be able to stand in opposition to them , and we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , these consequences will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Society at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ rows report un@@ loaded Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows report to the Miss@@ y is discharged by Pope George R@@ atz@@ inger .
that is author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows continues on discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very serve to the appearance of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their deep conditions on their own subsidiaries or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence in the domain atzen was measured with &quot; two &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the over@@ gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would need to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and damaged deeds , &quot; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; such as the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of everyday life and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is intended for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Prin@@ ces Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you would like to go on to the church and this is a perfect fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moreover , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes a very normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be ready for children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to be fair , present standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the report report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report published by the diocese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domain spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can hold that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence .
even with high reliability , the punishment for the pupils could also fall severe .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other not@@ ices that many victims were estimated to be the general public of R. , and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories were linked to him . &quot;
in an interview , E@@ emann , why the conclu@@ ding report on abuse sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows Georg R@@ atz@@ inger showed his opinion .
E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violent exercise in prot@@ ector by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , &quot; a contra@@ dict@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one lift up many students his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , who has become an ec@@ table musi@@ cally no top performance .
how do you register as his bi@@ ograph@@ er this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you should rather ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present in it .
it is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will be acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ al or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence of violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its active sphere .
it can be committed to him if they were too late , or have taken the first cle@@ ar@@ ings not serious enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the object of the cathedral in which he worked , was felt of almost all respondents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes him as &quot; &quot; &quot; very popular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; kno@@ wle@@ d@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; expertise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expert teachers who provided the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ bons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his Perf@@ ect@@ ism and its high emotional ality , who also led to w@@ ut@@ ches .
the fact that he did not only cast out with chairs and the key legs on the ground , but also ear@@ ch@@ ased and very nau@@ gh@@ ty guys who moved to the hair , or in the ears he gave himself to deeply wor@@ d@@ ful and exc@@ uses .
however , it must be said to His honour of honour , however , that such gu@@ ardian methods were widespread in the fra@@ il period , the 1960s and 1970s that were widespread in parents such as in teachers .
do you know also such breeding methods ?
of course , I think of everyone who was born in 1968 .
I have even experienced this yet in a world@@ ly school , a state school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely , the alleged sexual abuse and the violence of violence in the pre@@ school are the most certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles .
there is already one wonder whether it was not to do with his acquain@@ tance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media have just fell on him .
at the Bavarian Pope there are many who never understood it , still eager to take him .
but the truth is : the report emer@@ ges Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , a lot about the subject of abuse of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows was reported in connection with the report .
becomes Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report any processing or processing with regard to sexual abuse for load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one interested party for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , most victims are silent .
if they were not familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not certainly not a ch@@ orus master , who would have been a practition@@ er of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you rate the R@@ atz@@ inger student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he had just counted ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to hold the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I kept it ... for really absur@@ d to accept that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ sist@@ ent or cle@@ arer or more cle@@ arer or even more open , than compared with their parents , inter@@ nat@@ to guide , confi@@ denti@@ ality , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ run pupils and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of course to share .
so he can not be accused of having taken him or brought it on .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these resi@@ due crimes , as unfortunately it was done in some cases .
in the media there was much of &quot; non @-@ violent actions to read by Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is charged in the report &quot; Weg@@ ner &quot; report .
does he have to live with this scour@@ ge ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and non @-@ violent abuse and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely what is a mis@@ use of the report .
however , there is clean separately : between the school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other charges .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , thus from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the whole horri@@ ble testing ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys were subjected to a proper and mal@@ ic teachers and were terri@@ bly suffered , all occurred on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ ill@@ ary states must have ruled .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , since he got the boys only to face , when they were already based on the dom@@ eter g@@ aps .
on that way , as most of the most witnesses , the theme of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise of paradise .
what was different in the domain of the dome asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no seasonal violence .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating general humanity by R. , and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories were linked to him . &quot;
at most , the pre@@ h@@ let remains , th@@ aw@@ ed .
however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish and from the predecessors of a school where he was not working and responsible for ( such as the witness ) wanted nothing , and then again around 1993 .
just left Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently put the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Royal Navy , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it shows this on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre@@ school , he continues to pract@@ ises the test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative effects , he recommended urgent things .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity , as an investig@@ ator had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that they took place in a legal grey zone , just like anyone knows us .
there was also hard to estimate it , where the persons affected might have been ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
but it is not possible to say that he had always gone away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the testing penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria as well .
Prin@@ in Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and tax@@ is said it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ snare des An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of the past was present in today &apos;s moral standards .
since the prin@@ cess has quite right .
but this is not true for sexual abuse , who was frigh@@ tened to all times , and also not for what was broken up in the pre@@ school of resi@@ du@@ es and violence against innocent children , that goes far beyond the usual .
this is all horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be discontinued .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
its means for the discipl@@ ines and punishment , so cont@@ ention and to pull out the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment , he was strictly forbidden in it .
what image of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the talks with you for the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; ?
was the topic of the test sentence also in the language of the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : now , in the book , it goes about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI told me from his perspective , as the domain spar@@ rows only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not admit that he led a virtu@@ ous regim@@ ent there .
but this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without any un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world ranking , true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that followed twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and bon@@ bons alone , one does not make any major singers and ahead of any success , equal to what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ dings .
what kind of people do you have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and always experiences as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , deeply faithful and heart @-@ good people , of which one could not imagine that he could be able to see a fly slightly .
I regularly get involved with how many former domain spar@@ rows still today , 23 years after his retirement , please visit it regularly - he is almost blind - and he can treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , so are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ague teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be , but also a lov@@ able respect to them , to which they still look up and honour them .
and please , once again clearly : all things you have prepared for him are gu@@ ardian methods that were at the time at the time .
we may be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ righteous , one man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al fall of sin .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , is only very apparent .
because the report , which has just been released , was discharged &#91; him &#93; .
now the uprising was to charge a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had gained great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and maybe Germany , nobody would know who would have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic atzen .
