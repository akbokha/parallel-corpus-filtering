<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your look to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener spread the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Münch promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">This one knows that, because the car-Navi had to show a green meadow instead of a loop road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than the current - but just therefore very close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, the cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century, as well as cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a flickling carpet, which you can not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview card groups were incorporated for cities and municipalities detailed maps, so-called priot leaves, works.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and jump to the first surveying Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War, with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops marched with the peace of Lunéville, from February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a widespread Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thereby the Bavarian surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The primitive hand sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like to find all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the morning / day is the most impressive capital of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded steadily into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is the sendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was born 21 years after the creation of the map, thus 1877, when the Munich city district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of substana focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmer against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the West park is, you can see nothing as fields - at the first glance: when zooming appears there is a smaller part with dutzing lines and numbers: handwriting numbered from the so-called "Originals" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no small parcels, there are no farmers, but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterized by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 showplace of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desires in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, there is an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the reference paper, in the area of today's district au-Haidhausen, you can not only read the street names" "" "on the guest house" "" "or from the height" "" "on the air" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Ward" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfield highway, people would like to be able to insist people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "was created on the Auer Lüderitz.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Guddes accompanied the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended for example the strings of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden to the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, and later it was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrel institute in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists in Germany since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in Munich Salesianum on the area of the former Auer institutions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and was operated in a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was created - in architectural jection to the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" main square "in 1856, the name" "" "Kaufinger alley." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a saleskapelle from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days were working and on 5 April 2017, the groundbreaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn route.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting down, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Legal Group published Travel Report for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for promoting Colour has issued a warning for color people who travel to the discriminent policy and the racial attacks of the state after Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory Board intended to enter into force until 28 August 2017, invites afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to abandon travel through the state because a number of fragmentary, rament-based event occur in the previous state and can be noted here" "", "says the group's position." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain a discrimination against minorities, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, allowing the group to release the party warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights that will happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are attached or killed because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency we have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as rassistic verge against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol at the beginning of the year, when he had no petrol, and was accused by the police in custody without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor of the Prosecutor of the Missouri Council, in which black driver in the state will be 75 percent more common than the White ones.</seg>

<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hassine in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassender programme of the FBI, who prehort the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would be more difficult to accuse a company for residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was published after the States had passed the immigration authorities to commit people because of immigration fraud which will contribute to the ACLU for further reinforcement.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warning will typically be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in the last time those parties involved in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fences project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher electric fence project is an success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag by Peter White and Kordula Kovac have developed a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-gradient of the Schwenkard family, representatives of the fishing bacher CDU positions met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Winkeldemann initially granted insights into its operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods, 40 dairy cows and also many young kittens and houses in five apartments all the apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him of the aging-free marketers for the milk of his cows, as pivatory.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengäs, there is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fishbach, he also called the "elemental project" as "elementary sense."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not generate net profit on the art.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and to fight with the topography" "", "Schwendemann" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the terrier operation and used it to perform this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers even if it does not lead biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the decimal project and is glad to promote the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported by farmers from 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the view of the surfaces could still be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they bring their operation," emphasised the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand for the promotion often in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be recorded until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of which was funded by Leader, a quarter contributed to the Municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">This way, the farmers were able to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric faun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farms."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "for Peter white stand firm also:" "" "best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The regional rail line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of female cences.</seg>

<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR recorded funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the inseparable area may not be bad (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the collection.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher turnout project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">The White House of Trump is now taking up the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these as well as any other - therefore the sort of Saddam Hussein's place on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regimes, knew surely what he did when he did a symbolic deal with Jim Acosta by CNN via the proposals of the President to drastic immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay well, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of bobesers and Liberty Imitators would have tried him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their importance, and in particular the significance it was attributed to her as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Monument, its basis was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complain:" "" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is right, but as he formulated it itself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the contemporary response to the insisting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your labours, your poor, and your afflicted masses, who yearns to breathe free, / the refuse of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the mating waste was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict of the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place her words after her death at the base - knew very good that she is a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicism, in an unused classical photo depicting the female breaches of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no longer abstracted - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the code with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great herons as Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was denied, but rather an early neo-conservative, who bring to the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should wear the torch in the rest of the world in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Indeed, the great imaginative act of Lazarus existed in it so as she was seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense therefore, to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and make a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">Of course, this is not the perspective to recognize the Miller and trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their lamps should not shine on the way, but hate hatred, who is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shoots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member of Scottish contingent of the World Championships "won a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are competing with Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m stretch, while Eiliie Doyle was elected to the team capitol.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their chapter words was amazing, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes whether they were Scottish or, wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh was entirely of course, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredibly" that 16 sweets are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir leads to five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>

<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another scarf which one could watch after a great season, which was to watch the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships, when the only other carrot in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The national capitalist states that it is "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be among the medals and among the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "so special about the team capitol is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team mates voted for me and voted for me," "" "she added to something very special for me." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not work for a public office if you do not bear the fuel consumption of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the invigorous policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He is chimplied with the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't bring his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away, and, stupid, and dumb, like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it, to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the posts from at least 450 persons and will be deleted, who have sold their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online review was full of counter reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherents of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very courageous to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and acting his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post's spokesperson in Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockage of comments was nothing further than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of Trolls or spoilt or hash filled people who are online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no part.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, thinking, and not benefited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when people have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivity and to burn and kill demonstrators with a demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the statement of EPA indicated that Pruitt would have been able to use his "Befusions to the delay and all other legally binding" to ensure that the regulations "on a solid policy and the best available information are based."</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in the Congress push to a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 Years of the Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, at the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm to a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether his idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility, a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted from this powerful spot.</seg>
<seg id="469">Rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of the tumuling of their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique little jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Baden-Württemberg document: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the present parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and on his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the document, in the tumlinger hill except for the former parish church there was also a splendid farm, which belonged to the church or the patron, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Freudenstadt of 1858, beside the Lower-village and the Oberdorf, which today is still visible in the constellation of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the splendid settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old cards from the time around the year 1600 were the differences of these historical events.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronatslaw originated in the early medieval town law.</seg>
<seg id="477">The Lord, who built a church, moved and occupied with a priest, remained in the mind of this church, and was also inherited the owner of this place.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, the right to use a pastor, or replacing a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greatest of the two zerbarons on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell was then heard for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window pulleys were stolen and the bell was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops came near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs, and used it as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to overthrow in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the tumlinger Hilarius was also served as the last resting place for the dead from the listeners.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm split the bell tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent evil, the tower was thrown down.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today existing Turmzwerg remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wem has served as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius station.</seg>
<seg id="494">As a organiser, the friends and supporters of the tumbling falls on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to the St Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt with the word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Headquarters Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Entry is from 15.30 PM.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the ride of the Serenade you find a trunk in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organisers view the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only with dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters of the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumours and listeners.</seg>

<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Riddess Inspectively) has begun with the implementation of testing in the past year.</seg>

<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To assess the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we cannot say it safely, we should not do so as if we could it, "he said the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson, from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of tests: "in general, you can say that the risk to judge a child when adults is incorrect.</seg>

<seg id="1265">The Bank's policy decision makers (MPC) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly annual rate of inflation, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7%, and warned that pressure on the household income would continue to rise, although inflation is likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1285">Prior to the last judgement of the Bank on interest rates, the reputation has increased after a interest rate, as inflation increased its pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decisions made an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>

<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home which was not just a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>

<seg id="1334">This layout allowed the fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down across the glorious living area.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, participated in his first working day with executive employee, he set up a main problem in president Donald Trumps white House which he repairing, bad information given into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should be flowing - whether on paper or in mailings - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis does make sense, but others have tried to narrows trump to monitor its media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is at the White House, its TV show is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a candidate was retaxed because of an unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February against politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit is under control, according to the six ex campaign officials, there is to ensure that his personal media has a continuous lobPrize."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been under control, is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaigns do not know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets could still contain more ignition fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the Tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">When his staff admits to it a couple of times, trouble of him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump of trams.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House composed of competitive parties always try to present their own agenda by promoting trump material that may also promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - worked with this history - reported information on the preference of advisors, the president of strategic reasons for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example, described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former female servants say that trump can react like a volcano on negative press releases, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he turns out to find out where these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone was willing to accuse a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap at his Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson had been banned from Twitter being banned from Twitter, or that he has no concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false accusations and revoked it in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">He has read the article and began to question employees over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," attempted to implement a system in order to manage and document the trump "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove the most effective manager as Priebus but trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive to affect influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">This essential factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the hotel Birkenhof, due to the time ambiance of the Hotel Birkenhof, by the end of April 2014, approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost per year and also proceeds through the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic upward numbers of refugees, which came to the County, the hotel building was offered to the Landrata hotel as a collective accommodation for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by the positioning of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt-Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and said that time from serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenpark with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to go back to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabians and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is supposed to be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large outdoor shower, the input field is redesigned, the new window will be installed.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affaires: US Special Offers make Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair by U.S. President Donald Trump, a special exhibition by Robert Mueller is said to have an so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The "Wall Street Journal" wrote in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" under vocation with the job.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper says the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN was reported, there is already first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps Elerem son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence accuse the Kremlin to have targeted specifically to the Presidential elections in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were disagreements between Trumps Elemental team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are expected to vote in the election campaign as an advisor to the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also increased more and more Trumps private and business environment under the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special erler Trump personally was caught in the center and have the prehlet down whether the President may impede the judiciary in the wake of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand lawyer's mission is to check and decide the evidence in possible offences and decide whether he should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Lawys will therefore also be called together.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of them are turned on when it concerns larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure will always be behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In addition, the Panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to download persons for the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations have already been issued, which turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called, and called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultants and Jared Kushner and his damaging campaign manager Paul Manafort with the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right experts said on Thursday night on Thursday evening in the US television that it does not show that Mueller should not break out in his work, and that it should be necessary to do quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on by the end to decide on the survey of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the position of the office at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as the campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The theme will give the democrats a way to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he doesn't know anything from the position of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work is usually in salted, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agency on "fair" wise. "</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">However, Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rationality, accusations against trump were noisy, he had to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him a position of investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is based on an investigation under great pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to a representation of US media, the White House collected material against the exceptional items and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The dissolved speculation about whether trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special issue of Congress like in the Watergate affair around the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could be fired by the President of the Department of Justice in theory.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg, Antarctica in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic, a gigantic Eisberg has solved just about seven times the size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was the cerebvener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The total distance of one trillion tons, and 5800 square kilometres, will now turn to the north and probably will need two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With its 175 kilometers length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant researchers registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not work out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">How much the climate change has played a role in the demolition of the ice age, is unclear to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, since about 30 years, there has been a series of unusual clotters of iron pipes in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factense background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be coupled with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken coloss was so far from the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Consequently, it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this castle was the equilibrium of juniper and abrupt a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scam is falling down there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never turned back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and could be broken if a piece is cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelsesis and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice so much water as it arises after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shark causes the glacier directly to the ocean and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small measure, the British research project writes to the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers, the fourth largest gravel base of the Antarctic.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural look and does not make any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists were disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis now return or backward, his colleague has Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But these developments will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if this researcher did not lead this gigantic iceberg to climate change, so in recent decades there are still very many ice-elbows on the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long finish of the Antarctic is in South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the data of the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic peninsula has been heated over the past 50 years by around three degrees, thus the temperature in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials working for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>

<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desired.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were expected to be recorded in this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to work personnel in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At the moment, there are currently under 50 positions at the Mettmann circle.</seg>

<seg id="1580">In Italy, NGOs that use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea have warned that they are not able to continue their operations, if they do not want to keep new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said the Minister of Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Bet', because their team had worked effectively with men's hands in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation since one year, refused to express themselves in the course of the Italian state-walts Ambrogio cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acquisition of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast guards, the rescue service in the zone from humanitarian grounds and not out of any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the conduct of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must be aboard a Italian police officer who monitored their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs, who are involved in search and rescue operations, have so far been willing to keep the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules as unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring any "fundamental changes or Disabilities" of their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>

<seg id="1776">Mordillos Bollnoses and the laughter against the suffering</seg>
<seg id="1777">Mordillo was part of one of the most widely published cartoon animation, the buttons of his figures are the trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also at 85, the Argentier still features a film and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he proposed himself as a draftsman for happiness cards - what frustrated him frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happier day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60's, the breakthrough came with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again the artist was inspired by the cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Great, roundish Mordillo figures in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">On the early morning, he is still sitting on the cartoon animation, and works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Over calendars, puzzles, books for Gross and Klein, T-shirts, plush-animals and watches are continued to find a lot of prevalence worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos any other animal in its drawings - which has a thousler as a counter.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie that should come to the chin-up in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know what they will say, it is strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script is not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">For this reason, he is rather relied on the TV series, which is how his original drawings will be produced.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence from climate Change threatened</seg>
<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is due to the conditions of drought stored conditions and due to the disease-transferred insects, some scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the research institute, CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to impacts of climate change in the past years, who brought much more rain in spring and in the fall much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicade, a microbacterial, called the dwarf-zicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there's a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not just for vacationers, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either lack of missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered to be considered are a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties, which are resistant to dry resistant resistant.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalists underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet, in order to verify their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt civil servants and unhearing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists will discuss what to feel safer: they are to take their children to the office, who were the aim of an attack with grenades, or at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug glers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, which are suspected to stand on the list of the list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that are dangerous to the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of the violence, and during the whole country the corpses are frequent, there are always more journalist: at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto put his office in December 2012. 589 are still seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, her editor and her Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, which shows his central finger with the word "Justice", hangs t-shirts on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters show T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared subjects, trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Prosecutor has been established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the majority of thousands of murders, who are connected every year with drug trafficking and organic crimes, the murderers are rarely judged by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still exist to treat the force of Sinaloa, although they are untraterally and even though the terrain is still in stock.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting on discussion of security, is not a little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"we don't know that why we don't know the why."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The support went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa to one of the bloodiest battlesfields of the country, since rivalisating fractions will struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that anyone who are shot in Sinaloa every day someone or several people on the streets are shot or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-storey apoleen for drug royal which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace "" "" if only a cartel control on the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs trading routes in the United States. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalents of cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have the children displeased, presumably gangmembers bought each copy of the edition, as soon as they have been delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was in it, Valdez did not force to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same history to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues could imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as a experienced reporter to the Noroeste when he joined the Riodoce foundation in 2003 and sold 50 USD.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," it was impossible to maintain journalism, without falling to the noise of noise, "" "" said Bojorquez. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper had served a reputation because of the courageous and honest coverage, and the sales and the advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard treffing examinations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the formation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave himself that he had anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue on the CPJ award at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I would not want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the sight of many dead... why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">Valdez's Riodoce team has been missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a harbour workers, who was generously with Ukrain, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He always would go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and there always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them, was his love for routine doing his destruction?</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-breeding and self-accounting.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, lead away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "odour of a sense can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mix of lucrative jewellery, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones permitted. days before, Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside sought two policemen from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-class building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen, who gave the governor themselves as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drugs are de facto standing in control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has been baked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a posé to the State's spending, which focused on the home town of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was abducted or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write, what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug hands and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned about public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the Institutional Revolution Party (pri) that ruled the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of uploading cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal bat the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in whom a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's Office was devoted to the storage space for signs and sticker to protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become too little for themselves, what they would never expect: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalists to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">This day, director Bojorquez is gone into Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the Valdez's case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send and destroy journalists, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is again divided by the government, because she worried that her anger has injured her objective.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organisational crimes, involved in government officials and an equal society "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporter could not only be killed by drugs but also on orders of politicians and security forces with the organised crimes under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug store with a control article on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their native states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and search for hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are chased, as evidently the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City, was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the geared plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, green.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something that appeared from the surrounding rock on the Platze, and decided to see more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you have blinking only a little with eyes, you could almost believe that" "" "said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientists in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs issues - Mona Lisa the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with a ruction and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by meat-frescodinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong red dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as countercremation that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix himself better into its surroundings and to leave his enemies, experts say that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now able to see at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta markedly after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shaded shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady is usual, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs faded enough pressure by meat-eaters dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation ensued as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the cravings - think of Rehe, Zebras or hip animals - are much smaller and hurt as a prey, which indicates that this camdosages was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly bent Dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rodents have been the chalk time" "", "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows also that the skin of the dinosaur was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Researchers continue to examine the animal on his life, including his convoy, to find out what it did as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, fell into a river and driven into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South African today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with concentric circles, but also remains in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the beast today looks almost the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">They do not need a lot of imagination to redesign it. if you're just a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk-time was a time when huge theropodes, carnivocal dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, the earth passed through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus was born in Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was chased by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This is part of the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was rected after death in the sea and swapped in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, green.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the besteriliated dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raced from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the pumped plant-eater was weakened by the Western Canada through a flooded river it was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remnated remains of this special specimen are so good that the hood can still cover holdings along the dinosaur along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preserving so rare as a profit in lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it.</seg>

<seg id="2038">You book a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protector, love and loss, the strength and power of resistance, which consists of the visibility of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell passed with her daughter, who carried a cauliflower and a suitable crown after Ferguson, they spoke the two a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning, "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black men have to fight for that which they believe?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police office which became a camp site, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter are connected with local business partners, who made lunch.</seg>

<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell hit Sabaah Folayan evening, one of the film co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her comrades Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell to the sense: "want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by thousands of people, often of White - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Following the then co-director Damon Davis, Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism to death by todestrakt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on ferreling experience - to show that it concerns the movement "not around a Messiah leader, but to a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets show?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelles life, how she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the refinement of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferreling's history repeats the role of black pregnant women in the wider black-lives matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identifies the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, pregnant women in leadership positions have borne the movement in total," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are struggling with different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must wear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not a common type of action," where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the movie.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, although it was in front of the front, because with a life on these cruises as a black, pregnant woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel the energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social affairs of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern edge of the pedestrian area deprecated the population since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold is hardly possible on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" theme.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the fears make sure that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, including the other shops, the enemy fears that then the pedestrian street is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds, on which the farm market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work is concluded with the beginning of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building, namely to Beda place, with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all more important to keep us at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all the goods offered there is fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is obtains inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As one sees, shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms, because the dormanors are often not portable for one retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops there are almost no more and that which is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market hall set during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EdeKA would be the solution - even when the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or creates it a bit-gallery to distribute all stores from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it's easy to work.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a farmer market hall, thanks to the madness many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost inexplicable - which hang on the ceiling of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupstream and Haargles which were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the earlier intelligence analytic analytic keratched a 35-year-old prison after she was publicly admitted to the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resellers (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed to their professional competency in technology, computer sciences and art, and maning, a transit and pioneering displeased, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could look like someone with these genomic data, such as someone can be interpreted using these genomic data - the many ways such as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinants of these interpretations - but also to the identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly spoken about the identification as woman, in 2013 he was convicted of 20 accusations, including six breaches against the spy Act, computer, and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one piece of grain - a grain, black-white carfie, in which Manning sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platin blonde peres - which was associated with them.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg returned from the great success of their 2012 project "Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic Artefacts like cigarette lightening and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of it, like these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, therefore they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were sent to unequal letters, who had taken several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Canungo illustrated comic "supplementary images," which had predicted a future in which President Chelcials would convert, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, who would like to release man's release in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also some depth at the opening of the exhibition at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the governing camp and against transferring forces to find new, tweeted ways to move the rigid booting, which he actually wanted to remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for all these things, she said that "things come from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for mantle with her superior signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automatic breaks, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As described in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hope to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nuisotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) how amazing similarly, at least in biological respects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people do hopefully will bring with me is that our genome is not concerned who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is one page from the above mentioned comic Novels mentioned above.</seg>

<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapults and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>

<seg id="2405">It can be tired to be fixed on conversation, or it can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many excited aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submitting female properties that play a step to Frigid (name here: resistible) Farrah is troubled, inquiet one most.</seg>

<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "says the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fat or just a different sex game.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and its increasing refinery show a little darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards having sex with signage as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally be unable to keep sex robots, and while FRR is indicated its rising popularity, they still remain the preliminarly on the outskirts of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakage from the marginal zones can be leakened in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market gives permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are delayed in a time where the rights of women are threatened, in which there is a presidents in the White House, who has hired women to attack women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awful aspect of the TV series' The Hands' s Tale '(' The Report of the maidservant ') are not the graphical pictures, the worn bodies and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision is.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>

<seg id="2426">It has become an interest rate of the trump era that the political struggles, which have polarized the US voters, have split families in small size.</seg>

<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unit can have a mighty enemy against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including Republican kindred, had fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite strange at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to get the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also takes considerable risks associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand has been strengthened by trump, but the incumulative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the gruseliness of the possibility that his bibs will no longer be compensated for us.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is yet another long-time-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized," suddenly appear in comparison to his standards suddenly as intessence of distortion.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active Nostalgie for Mitt Romance novels - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we know how his tax explaining) - both occur compared to trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>

<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him full score, but fortunately no one has asked.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In coffee at the corner of my street there is the same, plus the option to compensate with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the Ladisch.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown, which should actually be a neutral exchange, but also practice pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation which is not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory illness)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Rotating meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes magnets and bubbles, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the persons concerned are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contribute to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immunotherapy in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, that hide themselves in the food, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to emulate inflammation, are balanced of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the equilibrium is too far in direction of inflammation, it can result in an anti-inflammatory illness.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, experiments were found that a kind of tolerance handling immuncell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterienart - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbioma and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had their immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan nutrition tolerable to tolerate less anti-inflammatory intestine, if the same system also work with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctor in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was looking for a type of immunoaks when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference to the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungus who normally live in the stomach intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were drawn up in a sterile environment, causing them not developed a gut microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria receded to the immune system, researchers painted L. reuteri in a liquid and then caused small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component is cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be known as a side-product of the tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan on the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 per cent, but if the tryptopical values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans tolerate the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri will protect our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-products from L. reuteri can develop the cells in humans such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells tend to control infections on the internal surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his Nimbus at that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the crisis communication since then, in the crisis communication, everything was wrong, what you can do wrong.</seg>

<seg id="2691">Even until September this year, however, once again the inventory would be carried out, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area, a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">As possible, in November or December, as soon as the propositional casting should be made, so that coming year with the renovations can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that every municipality had to carry out pre-studies.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The decision of the White House, a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that emphasises the American manufacturing in the last month, costs taxpayers to the military, which were left to the TIME magazine, up to 24.000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky vH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American building programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and director of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter was made in Connecticut next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklifts from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary course or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on South Lawn, after the records of the Helicopter Squadron One (HMx-1), which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I wanted to make sure that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of HMx-1 on the eve of the event of his superior, the Deputy Commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be needed for return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">During the course of the event, the entire flight crew was located at the helicopter, while the unit remained at the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The records made from the TIME have not been clearly stated, whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits Federal Committee to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMx-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed about that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds when you are sealed," answered the deputy commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "the" "" "Made in America" "" "was described by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act." ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President announced a violation of the reform of health reform, which was underway in the Senate, and propagated the efforts to establish the governmental regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, which is known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon, is scarcely a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMx-1 crews often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn, to suspend the US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMx-1 led to 58 practice sessions at the White House.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman by Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in writing the helicopter on South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMx-1 has no budgeted drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentaries of the U.S. Department for the 2017 budget for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund set for the vH-3D, but 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Record of unity recorded the flight time of a plane than 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers fixed on the basis of estimates for funds, it is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a Rand study from 2015, the funds for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but also account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former press release of the White House, Sean Spicer, has used the use of the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things that will be manufactured in America," said Spicer.</seg>

<seg id="2856">Generations of families have worked here and the labour force focused strongly to the local community and the Great Glasgow, an important column for decent employment in a field of high unemployment and social discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The Side of La League likes her interest in Marco Verraatti</seg>
<seg id="2865">In its persecution by Neymar, Paris Saint-Germain will not leave an offer of £189 million in order to resolve his overhead traps, but have warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world record.</seg>

<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry with the way that Neymar committed his way to outside, although a source in the vicinity of the Catalans Board exists, that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domsparrows report unloaded Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domsparrows report to the Missy is discharged by Pope George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That is author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domsparrows continues on discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," stated by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very serve to the appearance of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their deep conditions on their own subsidiaries or their then false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that reporting on violence in the domain atzen was measured with" two "" "two measures." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the overgrips in Regensburg, no one knows that it would need to be "shameful and damaged deeds," but the "degree of medial manipulation," such as the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habits, the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion that is intended for normal" "" "Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">The Princes Gloria of Thurn and taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you would like to go on to the church and this is a perfect frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "Moreover, they pointed out that in their youth" "" "strokes a very normal educational means" "" "to be ready for children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are supposed to be fair, present standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger, "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take George Ratzinger in protection," "" "Eemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the report report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report published by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment, Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s. "victims of overprint, 67 domain sparrows were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can hold that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high reliability, the punishment for the pupils could also fall severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other notices that many victims were estimated to be the general public of R., and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories were linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Eemann, why the concluding report on abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domsparrows Georg Ratzinger showed his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Eemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violent exercise in protector by the Regensburger Domsparrows," a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "one lift up many students his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he appears as a Choleriker and Perfection, who has become an ectable musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you register as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you should rather ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is present in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will be acquitted of any suspicion of the medial or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence of violence at the preschool took place outside of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can be committed to him if they were too late, or have taken the first clearings not serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the object of the cathedral in which he worked, was felt of almost all respondents as" "" "Redemption" "", "Heaven" "" "and" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "in this way, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also describes him as" "" very popular "" "," knowledful "" "," expertise "" "," and "" "" expert teachers who provided the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons and "" "" always surrounded by grapes of children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his Perfectism and its high emotional ality, who also led to wutches.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only cast out with chairs and the key legs on the ground, but also earchased and very naughty guys who moved to the hair, or in the ears he gave himself to deeply wordful and excuses.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, it must be said to His honour of honour, however, that such guardian methods were widespread in the frail period, the 1960s and 1970s that were widespread in parents such as in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know also such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of everyone who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have even experienced this yet in a worldly school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely, the alleged sexual abuse and the violence of violence in the preschool are the most certainly Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is already one wonder whether it was not to do with his acquaintance and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope there are many who never understood it, still eager to take him.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report emerges Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, a lot about the subject of abuse of the Regensburger Domsparrows was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Becomes Georg Ratzinger in the final report any processing or processing with regard to sexual abuse for load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I've never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said one interested party for the others," "" "it was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not familiar with parents and siblings, then definitely not certainly not a chorus master, who would have been a practitioner of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Ratzinger student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he had just counted (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to hold the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I kept it... for really absurd to accept that" "" "insistent or clearer or more clearer or even more open, than compared with their parents, internatto guide, confidentiality, etc." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the pre-run pupils and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">For sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of course to share.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he can not be accused of having taken him or brought it on.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these residue crimes, as unfortunately it was done in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much of "non-violent actions to read by Regensburger Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is charged in the report "Wegner" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this scourge?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and non-violent abuse and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">However, there is clean separately: between the school and the gymnasium of the cathedral atzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other charges.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents from the time since 1945, thus from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible testing pedagogy, the cases in which boys were subjected to a proper and malic teachers and were terribly suffered, all occurred on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skillary states must have ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, since he got the boys only to face, when they were already based on the dometer gaps.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that way, as most of the most witnesses, the theme of "preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise of paradise.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the dome asium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no seasonal violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims are estimating general humanity by R., and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories were linked to him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most, the prehlet remains, thawed.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just began to establish and from the predecessors of a school where he was not working and responsible for (such as the witness) wanted nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Just left Georg Ratzinger consistently put the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Royal Navy, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "it shows this on it," "" "that in the preschool, he continues to practises the test." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative effects, he recommended urgent things.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity, as an investigator had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they took place in a legal grey zone, just like anyone knows us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also hard to estimate it, where the persons affected might have been exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it is not possible to say that he had always gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria as well.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Prinin Gloria of Thurn and taxis said it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallsnare des Anachronism," so the danger of the past was present in today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true for sexual abuse, who was frightened to all times, and also not for what was broken up in the preschool of residues and violence against innocent children, that goes far beyond the usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means for the disciplines and punishment, so contention and to pull out the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment, he was strictly forbidden in it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburger time has played Georg Ratzinger for the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic of the test sentence also in the language of the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book, it goes about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI told me from his perspective, as the domain sparrows only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not admit that he led a virtuous regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without any unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world ranking, true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition that followed twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and bonbons alone, one does not make any major singers and ahead of any success, equal to what area, but always discipline, passion and self-windings.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced George Ratzinger in talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by work on the book and beyond, I've really met Georg Ratzinger really well and always experiences as a wonderful, humorous, deeply faithful and heart-good people, of which one could not imagine that he could be able to see a fly slightly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get involved with how many former domain sparrows still today, 23 years after his retirement, please visit it regularly - he is almost blind - and he can treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, so are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, vague teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be, but also a lovable respect to them, to which they still look up and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all things you have prepared for him are guardian methods that were at the time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We may be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unrighteous, one man, only because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make a medial fall of sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, is only very apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which has just been released, was discharged [him].</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the uprising was to charge a 93-year-old man who had gained great merits and without the outside of Bayerns and maybe Germany, nobody would know who would have to know the Regensburger Domestic atzen.</seg>
