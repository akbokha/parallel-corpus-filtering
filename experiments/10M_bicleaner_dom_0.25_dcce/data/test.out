a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ vy continued with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , which was found tomorrow morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , shared the medical medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department told that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running .
the brother of the Op@@ ens , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who worked as a cook in Boston before six months ago , had his dream home as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker said further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this heavy time at Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia announced that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that , &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Garcia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
his kind with his family , it was always something to cook , to prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of meditation .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all that goes wrong in the world , he was this barren diamond that sh@@ ined every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Anim@@ ston : I &apos;ll always put into drawers .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has clearly done the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ mistak@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be plug@@ ged into drawers , or are glu@@ ed from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
the act@@ ress gets p@@ act@@ ress at home , the act@@ ress brings her time at home , front TV with lo@@ z@@ ap D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to white , she will present the question of children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run on the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger will receive the pyramid of stones
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger , with some colleagues , sought a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
Chi@@ o : golden Sport pyramid for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses were reminded of their holiday , they pursued after the quick stops home to the feeding of food .
a kilometer at this tempo , I have dre@@ ad@@ ful .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left himself with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not feed on a horse .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at Chi@@ o .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports relief measures the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
on awards there is no lack of the symp@@ a@@ thetic athletes .
Federal Se@@ al Cross , Silver Lor@@ enz Journal , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the pyramid of stones .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award is a great deal to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporty achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring since decades .
and so he continued the price of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sports cars , the two @-@ fold US master winner was included on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , who Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ isch , the Ru@@ g@@ ka Frank @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , the An@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , the show jumping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the master &apos;s hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society emigrated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the la@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
un@@ one , however , are the two US @-@ presidential candidates for tax and energy policy as well as in a basic query .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosop@@ hi@@ cal difference .
it is about the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and war@@ ns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton to regulate the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
on the other hand , he would be quite different , claims by Tr@@ ump .
he will re@@ generate regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and it makes itself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses .
Clinton speaks against it : the state has set certain tasks to open , he has discrimination of discrimination and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich are increased , says it .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ ms .
the Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ rit@@ ual Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , even part@@ ei@@ internal discussions could be held on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal transport in the USA again .
in addition , oil extraction is to be possible in far protected areas , to terminate the climate protection agreement in Paris .
Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment program , and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only on the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ i@@ fish trading agreement , they both want to sign them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate from international trade - but just to protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they then ought to be paid even better , for example Clinton calls .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry wage .
she wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what does he want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the months preceding the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to stim@@ ulate growth .
his critics remain before him , so the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would remain even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who have to flee alone , almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they often are trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put their little son into the arm .
he was curious about his eyes in the room .
his m@@ om star@@ red on the table top .
until it noted that it is observed .
they sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the sole managing director of Con@@ tri@@ bs , a carrier for social facilities in Bavaria , and among other things dealing with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
in Munich , they live in Munich in one of the few dec@@ entr@@ alised accommodations for the frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ tri@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid relief .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are persecuted because they are persecuted or death thre@@ aten them or death , because their families send them as the hopes for Europe , &quot; she tells us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them steal secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced labor , honor , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
the flight path goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for a bottle of water a bottle of water require sexual action , no rarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they come in Germany , tells B@@ ahr .
even here , women in the refugee camp would often consider as inferior and ab@@ sten@@ tion .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in Munich , are trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are not will@@ ingly offered . &quot;
many women are as usual that they say nothing .
&quot; or they do not trust , openly about the earth , because the shame is too large . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t need to help yourself , there need more accommodation for them , for ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District regulations for the lodging of refugees is responsible .
on the question , whether they like from a similar project as in Munich in its authority range , answers some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not such a little in accomod@@ ations of governments .
also in Schw@@ aben alone , women did not lie separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are several common floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights and Equality of the sexes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important to be shared by men and women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy or women are accommodated together , it may be too - for@@ getting - violence against women come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower room should be separated and accessible to women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women have this protection of these need , you can read the And@@ res , which there is to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been spoken , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands according to new working measures
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to auth@@ ori@@ ze new jobs in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has required its entire Council from the beginning of September more work operations .
the J@@ DC said that there had been a minister , on the concerns relating to the contract .
in July , assistant doctors and media students agreed to agree with the agreement of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained peaceful &quot; in case of problems which was rejected that the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board approved the proposed new contract to reject the proposed new contract and concerns for all their concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the Swiss government &apos;s Swiss government , the J@@ DC Board approved a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to auth@@ ori@@ ze a run programme that starts at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the assistance of this year six times , the first overall inci@@ dents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assistant conductor , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election of the agreed contract conditions , had been recommended by BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions held before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and media students , with that the contract should be beneficial and adopted .
after the vote , the health minister of Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty for Do@@ ctors in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; Alliance of Out@@ side &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give himself the hands and to proclaim an official end of eight months of war the words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in Rec@@ eption , I can &apos;t suggest that Ankara wants to revi@@ ve these reconciliation in most .
there was the strike , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked nar@@ rower and he sh@@ ined heat , even for its long @-@ term circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report every five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that the relationship with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard that it would never happen .
his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the Russian Government of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the shooting of a Russian fight at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow from reaction to time was w@@ alled .
Putin he said , and accused Ankara , to have fallen into the back .
the sale was even bigger , since it was celebrated by an official friend .
the vase is difficult to build up , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a strong , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , the Turks seemed to bear the bl@@ ame for everything .
in the serious case , the alle@@ g@@ ations of conduc@@ tive officials had benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trading in the regions of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was therefore only taking place because Putin received the ap@@ ologies from the President of Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce is clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan run on first line all friends that he can get , after having failed last month in a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of nearly his am@@ nesty .
again , terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring multiple million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia the tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resumed .
they count to the Mediterranean Sea of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the estimated state @-@ television set up fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are imported again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there are long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , since its reaction to the attempted coup would be regarded as weak answer .
in addition , the continued g@@ roll on the snow @-@ emp@@ i@@ bility of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ vot@@ al on it is to go out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship to Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , the Russian government in Ankara won a bonus for ensuring that it requested a coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the elected State organs .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a self @-@ understanding that himself has a profound fear of the regim@@ es .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea gave it Russia and Turkey , one how it described me a analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of external side @-@ makers , &quot; two countries that are cast off from the west and is po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently admitted the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both Presidents were announced at the press conference , that they would not even under@@ score the subject .
the President of Turkey failed to answer a question concerning their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size these differences .
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus about it , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO &apos;s Member States cut off the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland shall no longer be available
according to the Bank &apos;s Board , R@@ BS has to be reduced more to a back@@ office role according to the Chairman of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected with the global amb@@ itions of the bank .
since then , the Bank has been dist@@ ressed , when she had almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this period , brand awareness &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumers .
she supported the international sport with millions of pound at Spon@@ sor@@ ing , six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by until the Wimbledon champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to move up more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the dec@@ entr@@ alised headquarters , and its stock network are to be changed to Nat@@ alia .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is being employed at our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand , under which our employees will be employed , since we are now going to become a bank of stamps . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has been on the global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we don &apos;t pursue any global goals , but to pursue local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work under these stamps .
R@@ BS has already declared that there will be his Six Nations sponsor@@ ing no more , and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop the brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better Bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cally three years ago , when we said that we will be a great bank for our clients and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can res@@ ume these stamps again , so I think that the time has come .

he set on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ let stand , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori who before won in G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy about it that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ker Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am easier and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel to win the victory when he takes on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
harvest pig@@ let stand , the nine former D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Car@@ rier @-@ goat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusiastic fans already for years for this sport .
I said to Frank@@ ie with a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already brought 6,000 winnings , if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ckey man !
Frank@@ ie has already almost 30 years winner of the winner , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that it is an incredible jo@@ ckey .

it was anno@@ ying .
a whole number of big tur@@ key win , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot , but he survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban .
three years ago he had worked with the beginning of trouble when he returned from his six months of lock , but he showed an impressive strength to beat his two @-@ fl@@ utes and to return to its best .
and he is not a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to move at competitions up to a minimum of 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia &apos;s Putin @-@ fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a part of Putin &apos;s close contact with Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special author@@ ization for environmental and transportation business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin that Putin is ordered without indication of reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s substitute since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the name of the Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) it was later that he later was later protocol and leader of the governing government .
on his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of head and checks to implement your instructions .
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov therefore asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are they convinced of the sm@@ iling faces ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this step has made Moscow mysterious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest associate of Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff arrives at his own request .
but despite the saving of the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections .
is here the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official statement - that one man , who once praised as potential President , would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy once more - overthrew the Russian environmental policy .
in his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; it is true that I asked for you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could nearly say - compl@@ ained for four years .
as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the National Security Service of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the Chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ anic Service ( FSB ) , the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
as Putin took to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people to whom he trusted in most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could be president of Russia &apos;s second term , as a third term coup could act against the Constitution .
but this post was taken from another , near allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before returning to the President three and a half years later .

rid@@ dle about fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for the identification of the fishes which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act with 75 fish about San@@ da@@ ale , which were sp@@ itted by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives in about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectac@@ le in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of two inches long fish .
Queens@@ land Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project &apos;s £ 1.@@ 35 bn project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four types of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ders .
the project is £ 1.@@ 35 bn project to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown completed a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to pass from the country on the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of a engineering art by a truly epic level of this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the outlet between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge @-@ deck is a heated activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks at their place and the last section of the de@@ cks will now be available in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ated for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted at its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first lock is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the ground@@ breaking high @-@ setting and deep @-@ construction works .
after installing the last street cover and its connection with the north tower @-@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the North or shore .
this was reached by pulling the northern state bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and very heated activity .
massive , because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled out at an incline of approx . 3 % .
hei@@ ress , as the toler@@ ances that the team has been working , were tiny - on each side it was only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortun@@ ate to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station smote on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while their boat departed from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned out around itself and made us the worst of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lu@@ ck@@ ily the strong winds have ended the boat except their range , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found in a Bo@@ je without the life@@ jacket .
they came all on board the coast @-@ saving and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have no luck and to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine had an emergency stop@@ over , but it dis@@ sol@@ ves the boat of the boat from the person who contributed the boat .
someone has w@@ aking up today about these men .

one man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely hurt .

this al@@ ar@@ ming soon after his sister .
together with their li@@ fel@@ lows the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ ten@@ der@@ tin of the man .
when the two women joined the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to his side and touched his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap Apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green : investors have to be much stronger in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; action concept &quot; on the next coun@@ table .
but dispute is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is to build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
SPD parliamentary Group Christoph Brat@@ mann think : &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all apartments have to show as social dwellings . &quot;
however , the inexpensive apartments can also be created in its inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the great dispute in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is you going to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to reduce investors on such grounds at least 10 percent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing feed program , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed , is intended to inc@@ enti@@ ze for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors a few regulations .
the left still has hardness issues for investors .
regardless of what , Brat@@ mann , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
the action plan is implemented , which will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get medical forces .
yet the program is not completely entirely due : because the approximately 1260 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you like to compens@@ ate the loss of further 1300 favourable apartments whose support is going to run in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about to get back home again into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
in one stroke , the problem would solve .
because in the western city run the end of the year at the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could be found there back to the price connection for convenient homes .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies do not want .
for the number of social apartments in the western city is dra@@ stically increased again , it is determined by the aim of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ blend .
there is no concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will be another movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with the boot must be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have focused on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
it is fascinating to see how the world has changed .
that teenagers and child must not go out to the outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens , was accused in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go to get people from the sofa and get more active .
the screen at the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games and last to smartphones .
hence it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I speak of course to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is created on the characters , which were initially created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( subsequently a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ Off@@ s ) .
as many phenomena of populations sank the interest in front of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
within few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
shortly after the player go out with their smartphones to the outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who were tra@@ ced with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 users , shared the Washington Post ahead with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who play Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for performance increase .
many public appearance campaigns to health , people want to get to be &quot; 30 minutes time to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day actively to be active &quot; beat on deaf ears because many public messages are bor@@ ing to health and come from people who look like .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be reviewed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances to get infected with cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people have close new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ ric gam@@ bl@@ ers that must always be difficult to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps had previously managed to follow our activity previously , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
the new one will lose its appeal and the use will be re@@ treated with the time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and to help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .

Simone Bil@@ it is on all the immune system .
dynam@@ ically at the ski @-@ horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on a whole line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ it@@ om@@ ni@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ war title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; teams in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal by Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ hah tur@@ tle at the floating bal@@ es during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ asts of the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als of America , winning a multi @-@ win title and the fifth , while they have established their reputation , the best of its generation , or even at all .
they broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was at the end .
this success presents them in the same league , like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates its sport in the past three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u B@@ on told her that she was the best gymn@@ ast that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected a last inspection in Brazil , a competition that was not as much as Bil@@ it and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ces after they each have gold and silver in the single multi @-@ competition of women in the gymn@@ asts of the summer of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
this was the first medal on Tuesday , while in the farewell celebration of the retired man coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an exceptional mark .
although it insi@@ sted on it , during their long distance to the top , never to have the future , this is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became power .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a surplus competition for more , a victory of victory , which will be as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two rot@@ ations , the image is red .
pig em@@ bal@@ m and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which painting holds the world title - listen .
they got up again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating @-@ bal@@ king again - and with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ ision - a pure mould - and tears run on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they described once in their collection book .
the power Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground exercise , she fell to the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ines , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
in the beginning of this week , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old musician from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series of mass during the music in the car .
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot , who have arrived in one of the most fatal attacks since a decade in the first serial case of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked by car , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator hum@@ ed eight shots from a hand fire@@ weapon , while it was standing on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police divided that the triple mur@@ ders did not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police station of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was led by the investig@@ ator , an immediate view of whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ hi@@ cal residential neighbor@@ hoods in the course of four months in nine attacks and two injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that they were tied and committed by the same rob@@ ber .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness shared the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting running at an empty pick@@ up truck to half an hour before the three times of murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial port .
investig@@ ator found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ anc@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ recipes : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ recipes , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about the mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first idea was , I create it not .
I do not create this .
I did not leave on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told you can never recognize it under any circumstances , and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people are still doing , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with a help to help .
Edmund could neither sit nor speak until his third year . he can &apos;t speak , nor speak .
but it is slow to progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers and to sing .
Elizabeth is showing the drawing language , which Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something ahead . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Edmund hasn &apos;t invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ e has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how the life of which is associated with the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus in@@ ctions .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an un@@ aware future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have not asked for a long time since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth @-@ damage caused by z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainfall , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue the ra@@ ins in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to publish the emergency stand on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned with more rainy day on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louis@@ ian@@ as and the south of the In@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with severe floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National weather service reported .
the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are standing in constant contact with the local authorities and had already been on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , distributed that requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand bags were multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the Church of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone had requested ten thousand al@@ sow@@ s .
a flood control system is used via broad parts in the South Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service suggests that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain in this area .
on Friday , a flood @-@ system was used on Friday , while it was ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will reach a record level of all probability after the weekend .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flooded many homes in the suburb near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , since the rivers run slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River Line in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached already at 9@@ am the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still collect people from the rivers water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ mother , were among those who were rescu@@ ed near the bell on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rise overnight .
he said that another step@@ mother , who dwells in the vicinity , would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are w@@ aking up and war@@ med the water , and came in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she lived there , never before such a cre@@ st of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ ial had saved all three in a big military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommodated till Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had rapidly spread , since it continued heavy rain accidents , and that the authorities had evacu@@ ate evacu@@ ations .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , there was an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground had significantly reduced the rain since Wednesday .
the authorities declared that heavy rainf@@ alls and road flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary EM@@ L reported that an or@@ derly planted in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now flooded both .
the ruler of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ices were set up in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed , due to the floo@@ ding and provided sand@@ bags for the inhabitants to the people who hope to keep the water from their homes and stores .
&quot; the last major flood which we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal administration .
this seems to become a similar incident .
in contrast , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison &apos;s Count@@ ess said that it rained on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses have been reported on Thursday as over@@ flooded , but on Friday we have not reported until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Sh@@ op@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I am under the women &apos;s Olympic Games in the Tower , and that from more than one reason .
first of all , I have been in the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lic@@ in is round , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has established the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ves a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the Americas .
now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ y gy@@ ma@@ c rout@@ ines provided .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als of America who won with an individual surplus event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but we didn &apos;t see turn@@ around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four tur@@ ers in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns will be an expensive sport and Turner first line in private turn@@ around that will be exciting for the training , training , travel , travel , competition , competition , and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these verses , Turner receive all their training and this is a dev@@ ote and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ it , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since then they started with the tur@@ ns .
we have to in@@ numer@@ able the municipalities of Au@@ n , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ performance and light @-@ accessible turn@@ outs .
I founded my turn@@ around for 20 years .
with my events we have trained free and affordable Tur@@ ning in Harlem for more than 15.000 people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ hi@@ cal ) , and training national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth &apos;s high @-@ quality properties that make the opportunity to learn from this amazing Olympic sports art and benefit .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the Spirit .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you to begin her way to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance of assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggest@@ ion rejected
the ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes to the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who voted in a choice .
in July , Hunt &apos;s plans were unveiled to introduce the treaty , saying that N@@ HS was to be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; which would be harmful to the employees and patients to be harmful .
the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night@@ life and weekend working hours to improve the care at all times .
DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A company for assist@@ ants , reported last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance systems , especially in particular that it would stim@@ ulate the current occupancy crisis and it is expected to meet all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks that remain still , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to the solution of the armed forces launched by the Government to participate in the government and sometimes strug@@ gling to w@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the word of a speaking that Jerem@@ y Hunt had made it last month about the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt has now been acting to raise the forces and concerns the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he did not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform further work operations .
the last strike at the end of April saw an inc@@ ision of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appo@@ intments , as nur@@ ses and specialist doctors have been involved in order to grant doctors on the strike post cover .
the ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes due to the adoption of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to give a better quality compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ ning , Director General of the N@@ HS employee , called for the assistant to end the strike .
Mor@@ si said : &quot; working fighting measures do not achieve a little , but already loaded teams and service providers , and prepare the patient , care and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we spoke to the assistance of the assist@@ ants , and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries have been positi@@ vely respon@@ ding to the concerns regarding the invent@@ ors and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer trusted that the continued positive commitment to other major issues - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility when training , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in the medicine - a sign that concerns health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning adher@@ ence to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after the authorities have been recommended to adopt this more people for a longer period of time .
the drug medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the regulatory authority of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people spend a heart attack every year , and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulate material in the arter@@ ial walls , the floor@@ ings form .
when the layer breaks , it may cause a blood flow to hide the blood flow until the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood flow and flow the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke fall .
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ ec@@ a and marketed under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by increasing the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the draft statement of Nice , which today was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the Nice Health Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack would have another heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ people consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively placed another heart attack and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - mainly the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the introduc@@ tory design recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
culture of the Cor@@ rect@@ ness of Cor@@ rect@@ ness is b@@ lossom in the Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on was established last year on the request of a government report concerning corruption from the Office
on the basis of a culture of the Cor@@ rect@@ ness , a well @-@ established election was acci@@ dentally ignored in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today .
the former Cab@@ inet Member of Sir Eric Pick@@ les is attacking the police , election observation and coun@@ cils , in order to prove evidence of voting abuse due to &quot; survivors of Eth@@ nie and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption of religious mot@@ i@@ ven , said that the police should be permitted to establish the police outside of electoral cabins , to protect hat@@ ch voters outside of electoral cabins .
he recommends that voters should lead a identification with themselves in order to prove their identity .
at the moment , a vot@@ er must call his name and address .
the report proposes to un@@ fold ink on the finger of a person if they give their electoral agree to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower followers ought to receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
he requires that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions of not official commission@@ ers or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial adv@@ ancement of culture that is associated with , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets constitu@@ ency in the East of London .
last year , a special appe@@ als decided that the am@@ chan@@ ted mayor Lut@@ on would be directed to a Lit@@ an@@ ei , corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ en@@ quiries to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose Him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation where one person cho@@ oses other than someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of deceit in the whole country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people , to choose a Candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to give the electoral system , including the drive of expres@@ sions to prove the identity
in his report it is : &quot; as proof was noted that pressure on the need of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ished background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions simply ignored the behavior of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belie@@ fs concerning eth@@ ni@@ es and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to acid the system , including the ban , that political activists may work documents to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ aqu@@ educ@@ t , requires also tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the choice of choice for immigration and social fraud .
options in consider , elec@@ ting voters in front of your choice .
do not remove ink on the finger of a person once they released their voice to prevent that someone select twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure they are entitled to ensure they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic post @-@ election .
- Pro@@ hibition that political activists will work for full post@@ age and envel@@ ops of mail @-@ election .
the police give the evidence to establish the shut @-@ up stations .
a law of legislation was facilit@@ ated by an indictment due to the repression of the People &apos;s Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Reports Act 1983 ) .
photographer in electoral stations .
request that only English can be used in the choice stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that employees must generally pass that voters alone go to the cabin alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; astonishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets did not show any penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the District Court of Lut@@ on has explained and his deputy for a Lit@@ an@@ ei , corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also guilty of a number of reasons for several reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ Control &quot; of the coun@@ cils of coun@@ cils .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Trial Chamber of Tower Ham@@ lets was a warning signal from the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is wearing a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of election losses and leu@@ g@@ th of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of the edge and band that has proved itself as an impressive double @-@ member of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one that has gold fighting ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you can give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces appeared on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympic risks that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celebr@@ ities .
the fighter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Double hi@@ kers on the rac@@ et@@ way , many people showed on the Internet as a certain ar@@ cher@@ y of the Di@@ dy@@ mus from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to him that he had already been listening to his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an outstanding guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

another important comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who is similar to heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter @-@ User@@ in declared its satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned off when he swar@@ med up his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m .

the criti@@ que of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with whom he asked him many .

C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologi@@ zing with more than 90 other Twitter @-@ ups that had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network was also exc@@ used quickly and released a message .
we regre@@ t it that these statements have been made , and that it was possible to broadcast them .
yesterday night we met our audience at our show and our torture in the social media .
to clari@@ fy , B@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald &apos;s deb@@ ated in the shipment and tried to justify the re@@ mark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment for a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I have made after the women &apos;s cra@@ w@@ mill in the C@@ BC Olympic program , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have moved on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ mark ab@@ ated about woman who tried to check in the middle of the business .
the purch@@ aser did not know where they should see when a woman went out in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants .
to give the situation to the wor@@ sen , she numbered her , she went out and laid her back into the shelf again .
she continued on and tested four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany .

a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who had found itself at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she turned again and left the business without buying it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from outside , moved their own strings and tro@@ users , and tried them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a little discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ skar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when she went out of the tro@@ users who did not like it , since they laid it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other tro@@ users before it finally decided that all of you have liked nothing , then she went and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seemed not to distur@@ b that she observed someone or about the person who would be able to buy the under@@ p@@ ants that they had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would have tro@@ users with home , who had a different person who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tries to move the clothes from the sale after she went - what is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants to go home and find out that another woman had attached and returned , and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Sem@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mas@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to surround it with armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether one approaches you from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn your s@@ ke@@ over for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you turn back to the rear , you should turn the first turn , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Line of Line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mas@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
turn the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat his knees with the knees and turn off , while the att@@ ack@@ ers in front of pain is w@@ ret@@ ched , the weapon of his hands . strike his face into the face and move backward , while being the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun line , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ ack@@ ers to the chest , then turn the weapon from his grip before they move backward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
take a look at the video to see how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a prey on the saf@@ est to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dirty locations of Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ nourished his immune system and wor@@ shi@@ flex of a serious testing by taking some of the most polluted places in Europe .
the Moder@@ ator and Tra@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk sa@@ wed his course to a euro note , a gel@@ ding at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ wah@@ er of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system .
in front of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show us what he will get in .
but the experiment described under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was a few surprising results of daylight .
the idea of le@@ aning the bone button in a draw toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely fl@@ ushing , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen machine .
on his journey through Europe Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the funding of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he le@@ aded , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his performer , as he went through the world and ate as well as wonderful things .
from public money to train stations up to the r@@ ins@@ ing of toilets , the task was the immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health concerns , and I have all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was charged with his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ lifer@@ ation showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ri@@ b is freshly cooked hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to take away after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly baked hands were less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places such as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes to the worst thing I have used in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not touch here , because it is inside the inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company pays Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ date Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explained the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ic .
we performed crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings , which thus ended , we said &quot; L@@ ass to call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest of gut health is to a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of gut health and how they are associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I could have lost my respect for Ian , if he wanted to have some of the things I have instructed him , like the ec@@ el@@ e@@ ed Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there was things where it was easier to bring Ian to lead them , and others in which it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty delic@@ ac@@ ies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of Vali@@ o survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents found Mil@@ or@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation Social Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a national family left her social apartment after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage amount of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ized their neighbors .
T@@ any@@ a Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the property association found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls spread holes on wood floors were torn up , gar@@ bage were scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the family administration at Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that they don &apos;t fear that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment for the time and the police reported that the terror that had added the family had to raise road strug@@ gles with bas@@ ins , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , drugs , and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for an isolated behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished under certain circumstances , old gar@@ bage has been found
they were tra@@ ded in the estate where they were tra@@ ded in the past drugs ,
neighbours therefore said they had to fight with them on the streets , and to be called to the police .
Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week violent from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were delighted by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the in@@ numer@@ able times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , wherever they are gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ lo@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that the family would have to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals , 20 years long .
in the covered side of the congregation , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant adopt , any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , because a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing is considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their works had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbors .
I guess about the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who were addressed to us and have made us the information .
I hope that these developments will be don@@ ate to some neighbors , and the message conve@@ ys that ant@@ iso@@ zi@@ ales behavior will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were living at different times in the house , but they all have more than 20 .
a dirty mattress was put in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
workers of house management are now to we@@ ave the land@@ mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 , police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
the skel@@ eton was given a fine of money after the ownership of a class B drug was found guilty .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee skel@@ don , who came in 2013 at a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ any@@ a and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will del@@ li@@ ze ten@@ ants , which do not hold on the order of the house
Angela C@@ row shared by the police in Devon and Corn@@ wall , that del@@ og@@ ing a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold on the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can be sc@@ aled without deduc@@ tions , as well as those who have been damaged by such behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police , Devon and Corn@@ wall , will never toler@@ ate a criminal and ins@@ ulated behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our churches .

Sonnen@@ an@@ be@@ ter in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a new P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of Air Force laid an incredible storm flight
the air forces showed that it was located on a training trip , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment in which wor@@ r@@ ying tourists begin to start panic after a ti@@ ary jet falls down over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed , as the military aircraft flew almost in reach above the sunrise at the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers rose , when they began to be wor@@ ried about the noise of the gearing , without seeing what came through the clouds to them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted video about the dramatic Fly by the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall off . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just by surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic , when the aer@@ op@@ lane came from the darkness and flew away .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on plane was on a training trip to identify fishing boats from the coast and so far had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to the poor view of view , however the air forces insi@@ sted that the safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese festival , with which four people came to death on Madeira island .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire - as far as far as far as its point of view .
the plane was located on a training trip , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .

bl@@ ame reports on his can@@ did@@ ature , he returned to his well @-@ known media reports .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gs

instead of what if the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger among the poor .
Olympia : three @-@ star fraud with d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar Commission to the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes threatened after the second d@@ oping affair with the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt to attempt at a d@@ oping check in the Olympic village in Kenya , Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee distributed to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ar Commission immediately , in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ nel function was informed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village , has released a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner of Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this has been reported to the team management of Kenya from the d@@ oping controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has searched the IOC for information about the case to strict investigations to strict investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation , and the following measures taken by the IOC , the IA@@ AF will show an assessment in the IA@@ AF explanation . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has issued itself as Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ ia Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
it was in possession of the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes born on the list for the training control of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup four over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Track &amp; Chief Financial Officer Michael Rot@@ i was withdrawn from the Rio games .
he is intended to have informed against cash payments from his country over pending d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he reportedly was arrested in Nairobi at his return on the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been on the IOC after many d@@ oping attempts since a longer time under special observation .
during the announcement of the IOC used more than 2000 d@@ oping target checks in front of the Rio games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the Vis@@ ier .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic start .
in a row , the WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose D@@ oping @-@ com@@ b@@ ating form with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of TV reports , ARD will always be le@@ vi@@ ed that d@@ oping is easy to be accessible in Kenya and to give it a significant ment@@ ality of the sport .
IOC member Richard P@@ ound requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he employed her in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in the process it was proven that this sport has been scre@@ wed and systematically developed in this sport .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer play .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a portable love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the classic temple , and it filled with the role of Maria a Youth Room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ z@@ on@@ al Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ius Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is heated .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ one music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a elder Mary .
she remembers their lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is extremely unusual !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she tells it in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I Fe@@ el Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is clever , of course n@@ ai@@ v , and very passionate .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli .
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor for us to work with her .
it is a spectacular man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
one sees it in every man &apos;s movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joy@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we went to the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ic@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are the same as the same thing as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girl who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria some weeks ago .
it was assumed that they were killed by an Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the B@@ oll@@ werk of the Group in the country , reported IT@@ V News on Thursday .
the sult@@ an@@ ana was 17 years old and died after their family shortly after she had prepared the country to leave the war and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these risks are associated to go into a war zone - people ever meet this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the East London rose to a plane to Turkey , and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
the sult@@ anas family has been informed that it married a IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months it became a widow .

the faithful magazine works together with the photographer David Bel@@ lem@@ ere together to launch a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of well @-@ known men it would like to find their N@@ U Mus@@ es Kal@@ uga for 2017 the next generation of Top@@ ic models .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of that year to be his N@@ ack@@ et magazine of Old@@ school players , as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men &quot; . &quot;
I am doing this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classical ne@@ ck@@ ness , when both women and men feel well and inspired by these pictures of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the Kal@@ end@@ ars .
women will participate in this project , because it is a magnificent artwork .

Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ ses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sits on packs of caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Presidency of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialog and the World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany calcul@@ ates the short term of ten thousands of prot@@ esters who fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; the association of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the hard procedure of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short term , with tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , with a few hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues fighting the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had exceeded Kurdish up@@ bur@@ gs prior to months with criminal proceedings , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run .
after the sh@@ ame@@ ful put@@ sch ch@@ efs there are still se@@ cular and op@@ position@@ able ethnic Turks .
many will be re@@ started in Europe when they are going to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that produces even refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the applicant compl@@ ain the targeted an@@ gling of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ ite cities .
thus , Erdo@@ gan would increase the expulsion of the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already eradi@@ cated in recent hundred years or expelled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the quality movement is also feared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , especially the Kurds and the opposition .
the fire market as a quality tra@@ ilers destroyed by teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t fit and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sits on packs of caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Foundation for Dialogue and Education , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper on calling on numbers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks presented the largest group of the asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
as a result of 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people would have been entitled to almost 29 percent of all ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , you will not find out the fear of war , poverty or the less@@ ness .
asylum seek@@ eth after the Basic Law are exclusively political , thus followed by the state side , individually promised .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : &quot; where to go there &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern : the locals received nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the country day .
they have understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
2021 - the country code will not be held directly at the end of summer holidays , the heavy Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
as far as until now it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ sw@@ elling combat - the bite .
the locals , which are to be convinced by the candidates , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the countryside , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose the country day .
in addition , practical problems arrive : in the holidays , helper &apos;s posters hang up , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers and at the end of the vote , can only be stopped .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last week day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern has to go for a time to vote against the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in pol@@ ls clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains the end of the most ambitious aug@@ mented style .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , head of government , making an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , looks from its large posters .
he travels across the land , distributed ro@@ ses and pl@@ otted a little with the people , as it did the legendary Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s predecessor .
otherwise , past@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the bl@@ ame on the b@@ lossom of the Af@@ D .
your refugee policy , her &quot; We are creating this &quot; I have accelerated the rise of sp@@ lashing lists , which will probably cost him a nice position .
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ class data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier has experienced how it is , if one make the wrong time on the right place campaign .
she has served twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally ; Merkel is the Bundestag in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vor@@ p@@ ommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent coco@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nobody can hear anyone from the other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel must listen .
otherwise , the North East CD@@ U ren@@ ounces largely on the usual elec@@ trol@@ ls at market spaces and before shopping m@@ alls with sun umbrel@@ las and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that , so co@@ ca@@ des , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
also the Union has noted that you en@@ cap@@ ed the base on the country that it must be very severe , to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there , in the times of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ electoral struggle with Kok@@ ert to his fellow wife is also self @-@ de@@ vot@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where there are people , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much on the game is , Sell@@ ering gave his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in pol@@ ls the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won with 3@@ 5.6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Small Party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , is likely to create the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday , a modern virtu@@ alization and lay their campaign against the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is called the Chairman of the Council of Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green ball@@ ots go on track search for native ab@@ stain@@ s amongst the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ did@@ ist , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and it is also beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : guest shops suffer from lock@@ smith
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ mod@@ elled , there is nothing to be angular .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos; clock in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock there is all the praise of praise .
&quot; they have done everything fairly delicate , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no default .
the building site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the end of October , to the south , until the end of October it should be finished .
at the same time he will also be responsible for the construction work , for example it goes to the establishment of accommodation drives .
since the construction site on Monday moved to the South and also the lock of the A@@ sper@@ g@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was abolished and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now go on both sides from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the export traffic through the village seems to be back .
&quot; there was partially significant complaints , &quot; says the head of the most responsible representative management of the principal Deputy Head of Florian King .
the local inhabitants of Bach &apos;s highway , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many s@@ mu@@ g were seeking for themselves and rather with her Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that man@@ ders are in residential areas in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the assembly called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable over@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said King , who made themselves a location for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been tor@@ tured already .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 kilometres per hour in the pace of the pace .
since the construction site has moved further , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open to the road again .
in the cards , business people do not have to look like .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales for sales , everyone who asks one to look through .
however , some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; End@@ less &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that for other firms , the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight decrease &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this also provides that of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the strongest suit the local beaches are located along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds significant words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ ak .
we have to be happy about every euro .
the revenue in sales rose to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road assignment has been thrown back to its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to have dismissed half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees , and half had been released , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has been on request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether to give a financial compensation , the restaurant prof@@ esses the location of the location on the B 27 . now , they must also have the dis@@ advantages , which may result in the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other rural districts , where some more generous has been handled .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host is continued .
after all , the family company has already been located here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
with regard to the complex transport , other members of the family are less frequently used because of the complex traffic war@@ fare , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive out , it is also very different .
that , after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clients for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in many years of history .
six months construction work , which is already brutal .
constantly in the name of terror attacks on laws is scre@@ wed .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners says to all ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
all his suggestions may be &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs in the presentation of his new security package .
they would not challenge anyone .
others , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also particip@@ ates in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the interior minister , however , is situated on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive ones .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the kno@@ cking encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the fact that Germany must implement several EU requirements for passenger information and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities are not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second stop for suggestions that did not make the SPD until now : he wants to put an sympath@@ y for terrorist groups under punishment and jihadists with double citizenship in the German pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U guy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has nevertheless kept this yet for a good and challenging , no odds , which have no chance at the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ist .
a few new ideas will be presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them are partially in itself : he plans quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people in front of deportation .
refugees who are brought to the country are to be brought to the country before their smartphones and social media accounts for a safety test .
at Dul@@ ies for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to commit some even worse than so far - about such that commit criminal off@@ ences or reject their papers to s@@ lack their identity .
some of them is politically and legally hei@@ rs .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and can be open questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ul@@ led to the example - is the question : what does that actually do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were there .
in addition , many people concerned about the high number of refugees to worry about the security .
and things that love people are deeply wor@@ shi@@ ped , but now they were unable to cl@@ ash in their constitu@@ ency .
the internal safety is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the contamination is great .
and yes , they stand strug@@ gles .
Union and SPD bring their internal safety in the subject of internal safety .
in the past days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ bage battle on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the resort &apos;s ch@@ efs also require a bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also ear@@ ring here to reconc@@ ile sounds .
there is nothing from a return from the double pass .
we met the discussion in Germany .
you are new to make sense , be not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he was constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; is not yet to show for the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ists .
there is a lot in it that could cause a dispute .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing the internal safety on the topic of internal safety .
party Chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once with c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security . &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ de is yet to come in .
despite the Diesel@@ and@@ als the delivery figures rise in the world .
but it is not running in all markets .
with the recall action , there is vor@@ tex around a concept .
Volkswagen starts from deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ operating markets , Europe &apos;s largest bus station can continue to increase the market thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand VW were weaker primarily in Western Europe , thus generating the total sales again , such as the company recorded in the Da@@ x .
worldwide , the VW @-@ Benz brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
deliveries in the home market Germany had spread their deliveries by almost a sixth hour .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July primarily to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , we have granted a purchase agreement in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote of the withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the exhaust aff@@ aires first es@@ aw , there is also a min@@ us be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly concerned house @-@ brand of Lower Saxony has remained in further gli@@ mp@@ ing by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition request from 0.9 per cent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles are be@@ ech .
Group Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler continued to split a sales from January to July .
Volkswagen has provided 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time , 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated the software with a software application .
in Germany alone , VW calls some 2.5 million cars to re@@ arm@@ ament in the workshops .
in the course of re@@ arm@@ ament , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ arm@@ ament the vehicles , it is no deteri@@ oration with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car of the bus to the re@@ arm@@ ament is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as stated on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason : legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for all diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this last Monday VW representatives of the Federal Ministry of Industry had confirmed this last Monday .
it was confirmed by the Transport of Transport that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has been able to fulfil the issues of my investigating commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Justice Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that , on fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after re@@ arm@@ ament no deteri@@ or@@ ations will be held and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicles remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
in the long term &quot; guarantee &quot; we see the possibility that customers will come to a factory for half a year after re@@ arm@@ ament within a factory - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do .
it is also important to avoid that it is important to do in any other damage caused by w@@ ai@@ ds to do anything with the g@@ ass@@ ation sc@@ andal , as it was called .
therefore , VW use the concept &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is required by rich au@@ sterity in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gre@@ ase or daily cash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see it by a signal : normal as@@ par@@ ity would have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund as of September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has held 40 million euros , who could be withdrawn from one day on the other , and he could not be able to compare it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those lie with me at the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay 4000 Euros for each million . &quot;
the cost of shipping has now been given to the licence principle .
it &apos;s easy to leave cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve never experienced four over@@ cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the Bank of Bank .
most customers could have understanding and changes in other investment forms .
only a few hi@@ kes to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable cost to all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear to bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating profit is not permanently possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ ing interest for deposits starting from € three million , the Thurin@@ gian People - and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank Fili@@ ale 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , principal managing director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , in addition , the competition in Germany is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele that is a little bit of lush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a little bank for the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bench G@@ mund founded in 1911 in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ah @-@ E@@ at , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , we live well @-@ known actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to charge an evaluation rate for deposits by private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federation of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go to the negatives by the private client is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was hard , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of legal gu@@ ardi@@ ans to the competition .
customers in Germany will not be held in the width .
destination : who purchases real b@@ anners ?
lon@@ ely men aged middle age love records .
before you come to the commentary part , in order to over@@ see him under the p@@ seud@@ onym Un@@ Alle@@ en@@ sam@@ ic Age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the resurrection of sound boards is not present on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the re@@ dness of physical objects , but due to the Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have purchased a record recently , are all pre@@ views to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional importance : older plate staff retain their feelings for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone spending time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while I run in a busy street in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit and getting wild , before I stand , let my hands hold and something best thing as : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slow to its charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic properties .
I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part , where I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men , middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess &quot; I guess &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not have followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has an important number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy boards that he could not afford , when they appeared and re @-@ buy items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably a little boy to buy them , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy disks are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believe that many customers that he meets at the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get back to buy their old records .
of the discussions that I have led , people are generally accepted as of 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves again their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of a specific age at a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of boards ?
it takes just a few seconds to get into a shop like Ph@@ on@@ ica , in order to recognize that record shops provides a soo@@ thing community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took a violation of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some of the record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to pull down the stability of familiar b@@ rist@@ s , from objects to watch the happ@@ ier youth .
&quot; I think , sometimes , it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record stack of stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pol@@ l of the IC@@ M revealed that almost 50 % of people who have bought a record from the last month they haven &apos;t listened .
the survey found that 41 % have a turn@@ tables that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record players .
at that time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while using a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ ut@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at So@@ unds of the Universe ( data number : three men of middle age ) , has noted a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio record top so that I can set it into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it certainly happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cla@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who come only slowly .
opp , which has dedicated the sound panels almost a whole floor , has an underground audience than I go .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ age and Women &apos;s middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores , the Wild Be@@ asts of the New Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and right @-@ wing Pop instead of Experim@@ ental Jazz goes from the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such di@@ vers@@ ities in the customer .
none of them looks strange , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be able , if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been around for a few minutes in business and consider the Vari@@ et@@ als of the boards available for sale .
she rather makes a man@@ ger bum@@ ble than a big purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve a lot , therefore the collection of panels does not have real option , says it .
it is much .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer or to other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ dly si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have been inspired by a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ jam .
while I give the note to cour@@ ier the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young te@@ amm@@ ers who group@@ ed for a moment to buy Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cro@@ sley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody can look at them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in view of what any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to be chargeable .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even though my re@@ research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in disc @-@ shops in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record owners who exist in reality , turn@@ outs and in on@@ line@@ continue .
these people are probably work hard at school or in offices .
you don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security , with the mountain shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through boards , while it mei@@ er the ne@@ cked ga@@ ze of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old lying Moder@@ ator who prot@@ ru@@ ed nothing from the shoulders above the shoulders .

in case of a trial negoti@@ ating this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary businesses within the camp , from cigarettes to Ener@@ gy@@ z , sell hair@@ dres@@ sings or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be ri@@ pped down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would not be paid out of taxes and trust a fire and growth rate .
humanitarian groups share the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals , which are offered by the state @-@ supported Association and other groups , not sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there should be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary shops , but it seems that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely un@@ re@@ tra@@ ctable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role as only people live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café , which is meant to be born and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice to asylum seek@@ ers for the hundreds of protective needs , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure of the closure of these children of a catastrophe would be , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants increased on Friday that the number of living in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains fighting table
despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ schi@@ i Tony Martin don &apos;t want to get down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I continue to keep the WC in view , remain confident and strug@@ gling , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have a statement for his mis@@ er@@ able twelfth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hon@@ estly hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace which had led the reasons for de@@ ac@@ el .
during the Time World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin actually wanted to fight the title .
&quot; I will watch everything exactly what we have changed during the last time . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany Ras@@ ps have to set itself on the next generation of speed : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ th@@ ier is especially effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident levels where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to gentle bridges with temporary Tem@@ po@@ ke , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary bl@@ ender for compliance with speed limits .
a permanent mobile body can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement mode , the case data will be transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be measured over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access to time , driving strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ driven state you can move the trailer according to manufacturers with each car with trailer hook .
with it , it is not easy to cut off , it is lowered in measurement mode , so that the wheels in the pan@@ eled and inci@@ dentally van@@ ish .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the gl@@ itter in front of v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the information of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities are also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France returned 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain re@@ covers silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after the master@@ class of Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ seater Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday night at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten up with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ aler Stadium in Rio .
Fiji , a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ end@@ ary , line run and ro@@ wers to win gold - their first Olympic ame@@ da@@ ille every color .
the defeat was failed because of the not very bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the finals .
but ir@@ respective of that , a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form would have been struck .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB , but it will probably not think that at least a gold medal around his neck will have hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben R@@ yan , former Chief of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult track behind .
eight years ago , they lost their game with Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this fla@@ p is we@@ h@@ ed , but the progress is amazing .
the head began to be silent and left the attacks GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it felt for the Kapitän Tom Mitchell and Co . on , as one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au walked over in the corner .
at the same time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly t@@ apped the ball .
a hec@@ tic trol@@ ley of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate , but it &apos;s only stopped .
in the seventh minute you can catch a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute game play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ f@@ ake through any weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion carried a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s so , when you were born to play the 7 , while GB still remains da@@ im@@ ated .
it is that way .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilli@@ ants run of Fiji .
Dan Norton launched an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea , whose fans che@@ ered and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i bag pointed out with another attempt in the last seconds .
the so@@ ff be@@ et , the Fi@@ j@@ is en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed and in the blo@@ od@@ d were defeated in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fiji that defeated Japan in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain forced South Africa with a tight half @-@ fin@@ ite match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton Cook passed the line with an impressive foot@@ steps and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ body teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer of the trainer as a rowing victory
there will be no more engine gold than those games , and that wants to be called what .
from the first ru@@ dder until the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it were only those who were sitting at the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ otted to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the branch without tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which laid a scale in such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all of her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ interrupted use , which is also exemplary .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ lets that gli@@ des on the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the nature of the tri@@ bun@@ ny .
behind each gold in the Ru@@ dern , a batt@@ ali@@ on con@@ sent@@ ed to hel@@ pers which make the difference , and there was no man more helpful than the coach that would not survive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had a bl@@ adder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do this , he spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it is changing a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which held the inter@@ ruption for a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was in hospital and ran at around 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
it begins that way .
the rowing itself is a challenge , but this makes it even larger .
in the in@@ fert@@ ility of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who used to spend some more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a centur@@ ion in the Royal Art@@ illery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much that this means , how much I and Helen and also worked with Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could have no better person for a train@@ ee or a better trainer .
Helena St@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; remain in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great .
we wanted no fireworks today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the pair will take time for one year before making decisions on its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure means .
in London it took about six months to compreh@@ end that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the executive director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large hydrop@@ ower producers .
so the name of the Bavarian Radio was set up in front of some time in the original Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the government of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia under@@ took the purpose @-@ association .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group &quot; bay@@ ern far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin @-@ association staff , of which 28 years was as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and we@@ iler with about 5500 inhabitants annually .
affili@@ ates are the commun@@ es church loud , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
there are water supply applications for other towns and municipalities .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water keeper in 1985 , and in 1988 he was appointed managing director of the club .
&quot; his responsibilities have been very diverse , and they extended from the water conduc@@ tive and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , the budget design , calculations of fees and contributions to emergency rates on weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman .
as an outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers who re@@ alizes the renovation of the flood ( 1999 ) , the re@@ development of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the partition of water@@ pipes .
there was no breast@@ feeding and I have always added innovations , because water is saving and drinking water to the most important food .
in its foli@@ age , she praised the faithful , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 .
he has been used with a lot of heart bl@@ ut for his water @-@ purpose and has been in a regular basis for the water @-@ purpose as it would be its own company .
in a few weeks ago , he tried to present the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group for nit@@ rate from the Lower Fran@@ fran@@ ken River Forum in front of a few weeks ago .
for this he received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the other hand , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greek , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water family and he was a faithful male .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he created the well @-@ structure and the re@@ structure of the purpose .
the greatest challenge and the most difficult use were the tu@@ b@@ ation of the flood at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees to work the whole night , so that the villages could be looked after with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained only because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with scra@@ pe .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who took over the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to another affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the now eight year old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him anything about the two years , when I sang to La Scala in Milan , he reminds nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happy man of the earth .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at his companion
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called to us and given to death his life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police citizen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him will be made public .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the way with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , mus@@ cular , brown and has a lat@@ tice .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with him , so the police force .
anyone who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police talks of a &quot; Association of Association . &quot;
the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no information about the T@@ ather@@ ette or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a sol@@ itary deli@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; we are currently unable to say , &quot; said one of the police leaders in Lübeck .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational force ( SEK ) was found at the Tat@@ site .
steel - light view for Deutsche Steel Industries
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ based German steel industry remains spared by an additional cost in million@@ th height .
financial burden , that threatened the sector from the eco @-@ current promotion , are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es in the German Steel Industries was held in the German Steel Industries , German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western German General Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission initially planned to use steel producers , the gases coming from the ho@@ op to power generation for their own consumption to pray for the checkout process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry associations , the steel industry threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic certificate with the European Commission for convers@@ ations with competition Com@@ miss@@ ant Mar@@ gre@@ a V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators are replaced in the steel plants , an EEG environment is 20 percent .
but even these are not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission to qualify for its own production .
thus the status qu@@ o of the previous regulation will be established largely .
special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need to follow &quot; further . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Reform of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emis@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis of 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year the situation intensi@@ fied as the world &apos;s largest producers in China led to the global market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturer t@@ oss Chinese steel concerts pri@@ d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
in order to show an authorised injection oil on import steel , the economic prospects for China have raised up in China .
un@@ clear is how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp slow@@ ed out on Thursday .
recently , prices would have stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de closure of individual works as well .
at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German Steel manufacturers remain careful in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , like the Steel Association of Steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced amount therefore went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is around two percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
the association expects to increase its increase in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
fellowship , Spirit , Health : singing Good Gu@@ ards
the S@@ ingen has already accompanied her entire life : as young girls she was in the school choir , at the teaching position , she performed the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a seniors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing me - emotional and physically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal it feels comfortable , che@@ er@@ ful and a total of living , she says .
next door she has done something good in her health and mind .
because S@@ ingen is like a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior League .
most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular assembly , seniors can link social contacts and maintain .
because often social and family structures often solve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize ourselves to the others , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for there they exercise a profound and controlled breathing .
anyone who calls his lungs are not so fast in everyday life as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even though it &apos;s about to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , &quot; Ursula L@@ enz says from the German labour community of senior citizens .
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in the spare time , it explained .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing from songs to older people raised many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
due to song tex@@ tured and particularly melodies , people are de@@ pressed by themselves for long @-@ term events .
in addition , the head requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time to focus on its own voice and to focus on a given rhythm , and to adapt to other singers , this is a huge cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not only practice themselves to concentrate on itself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you race through the singing of singing in the choir is H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing of singing .
even to show : if I &apos;m getting a bit for something , I will feel better and awake over me - this experience becomes stronger .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to test a new hobby should not hesitate - even if it means to have little talent , says L@@ enz .
one does not sing alone - at 50 sing people , who hears there , if once a tone is next to it ?
looking for the appropriate offer , seniors different ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquain@@ tance in an old par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the environment .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the church leader .
many senior citizens are also found on the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours with the help of the Internet .
anyone who wants to sing is necessarily to join a choir , av@@ eng@@ ed H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing soul is good and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react more sensitive than K@@ ater on Sch@@ re@@ ie of young k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover , where the effect of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
in her surprise , the Mi@@ th@@ aw didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however , in contrast to the females , they kept the same .
female cats can recognize the path@@ ogen from Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the mi@@ ths of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster on lu@@ te from k@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great distress as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
however , K@@ ater react to the herds of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acou@@ stical differences between the ja@@ ws of less and heavily damaged young for the males are either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ ization in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ sh@@ re@@ ie distingu@@ ishes itself with the complexity of their help .

Po@@ dol@@ ski takes place with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ward is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ door .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
prior to the Du@@ eling of the Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the suspension of acceptance after the crash test in July , the government , which should not be affected by normal dr@@ ink@@ ers should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of having regard to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not made before the football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ward , the prosecutor filed an arrest warrant .
accordingly , in the meantime , the southern door is being accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
southern door is to be the pre@@ acher of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
indeed , the emergency condition is still valid for 90 days until October , in fact , however , the majority of the Turks occupied this way as well as no impact on the life of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy Wa@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the whole country made Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for its end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Earth .
especially fans of the club Club Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but in view of dramatic experiences in the history of the Turks , the stri@@ ving ref@@ usal of military put@@ sch is comple@@ mented .
there are even the fans agreed - no matter whether their heart beats to Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; will be coming to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski once again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in its sporty value , the Cologne set itself in the past season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as the top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated him : &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master took a conc@@ ili@@ ent conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Pre @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also posted early in the Europa League .
in the south of Li@@ g it reached only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as ran the game year better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who hit the base of the 14 season with 26 season figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g .
that is why the fans continue to hope on the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at that time , the AC Florence was under contract with the contract and announced at Bes@@ ic@@ eh@@ ene Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to return to the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the storms would have to be ready to ab@@ stain around one third of its worth 7.5 million euros of estimated annual salt that we can not pay : &quot; his salary in Florence can we do not pay . &quot;

but there are still numerous other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start in the Rio Olympics in spite of the d@@ oping time .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the Field Ath@@ le@@ tics .
he was locked two times due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ Champion runs more quickly than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest ch@@ allen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .

Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ stein , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes were subsequently recognized as many medals .

the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized bronze medal in the 2008 Olympic Games due to a decision by the International Court of Justice CA@@ S .

bom@@ ber error in Thailand - Austrian ban@@ ces injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Friday .
in the hospital , you have suffered and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this once again .
your home journey is planned for early September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arise in terms of permanent contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ ell .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the Bangkok Hu@@ a H@@ in capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded into two bombs on Thursday night .
according to police , a Thai police have been killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including Austrian experts , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
there were again two attacks on Friday , so that another man was killed , according to the authorities .
also by Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb det@@ onation was reported in the morning .
in the proximity of the popular Ba@@ th@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed an urban employees .
the explo@@ sives had gone to the air according to the authorities in front of the Re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
after all , the determin@@ ations of Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g are called on the south@@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the Southeast Coast several injured .
they go from a connection with explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army degree of Dan@@ ai Cher@@ ep@@ av@@ ee before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we anticip@@ ate that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself as possible moti@@ fs - but it is likely to do the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim Separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police declared on the other hand , however , the terrorist attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said one spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
rather , it is rather likely that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received secret references to the forth@@ coming days in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t be informed about exact dates and places .
yet it is un@@ clear that group behind the attacks .
the police proved their civil servants in the whole country to enhance safety around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bombing attacks , but they are usually not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the past bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to provide the instructions for the Thai security authorities in order to ensure the instructions for Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and son@@ ah Vi@@ ac and its surroundings .
after the disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , before not necessary trips are taken into this provinces .
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on the Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this grants the military influence over the coming years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs had been an attempt to em@@ its chaos in the direction of stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military in@@ ta led to power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , the Kingdom itself maintains good to revi@@ ve the kingdom and order .
however , it did not succeed to the military , who have been in the out@@ ward part of the country in the out@@ ward part of the country .
more than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago , in Bangkok , there were 20 people killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du scar@@ city - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack on the younger history of the country .
the rights &quot; ident@@ ities of Ident@@ ity &quot; is on behalf of the Federal Office of the Federal Office of Constitutional protection .
after several regional offices , the constitutional complaint was also taken by the Federation under Ob@@ servation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the identity of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the Freedom Democratic Party &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said constitutional chief of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate by the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the Muslim Brotherhood or from the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ assed in the most extreme way .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; ident@@ ities of Ident@@ ity &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is turning towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the loss of his own identity thanks to transition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional complaint in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - watch the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
he said his authority to be close closely with the governments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the day Islam@@ ists as well as right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no bet@@ tered advertisement for its own cause .
the prop@@ aganda should emotional the people emotional .
young people are due in a special way .
that is dangerous .
last time it had given reports from several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; to Af@@ D politi@@ cian .
Ma@@ ate did not speak , so did he do no knowledge .
for the Constitutional protection , there are possible contacts of this species from a certain point .
it comes on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are most extreme , changes its target and so extreme .
thus , the influence of such people would have the influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase in rights and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee agreements , he would not speak of new terrorism in this connection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have established in recent years that there can be righ@@ t@@ onal structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite true that further legitim@@ ate groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee children or attacks from other right @-@ wing mot@@ i@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a German @-@ country or pan @-@ wide control of legal gu@@ err@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the existing groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed themselves about that many excess handles went on the account of people who had not stepped down in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum properties are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or tra@@ ilers on the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed pen@@ alties that previously voted by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD , or left , but have radi@@ c@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extre@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic risks or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ age@@ ous performance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sponge the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that he could not see at times more in TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
Hab@@ te became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it in the social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended his second place with a return of 48 seconds , finishing the 5@@ 9th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather its not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ cut countries well known .
because in ae@@ th@@ op@@ ia the most sport@@ s@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes herself ready for the big race .
fast , the first nick@@ name made the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only defeated a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played there no role .
the same with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i used for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from the equ@@ ator@@ ial @-@ Guinea when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of free style alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ isch was fired at that time Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the contest .

as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed a new calendar of fees for se@@ wage systems of the market town .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and sub @-@ discover@@ ies from the previous calendar period are to be compens@@ ated .
with all three se@@ wage plants , the Schmidt under@@ took the fact that there are relatively small establishments with a very low tide of waste , that fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis for example , expenses of several thousand euros would be excav@@ ated as a result of the low distribution basis .
in addition , waste water flows are slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
continue to continue in the past calendar period in all three systems , not least due to their age and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ding ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt demonstrated that in the Ab@@ water plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by the mechanical ventilation system due to a loss of damage .
in the pump building , which had to be over@@ hau@@ led , the nearly 20 year @-@ old conve@@ ying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond plant L@@ opp had to be replaced after almost 20 years , the cl@@ am@@ s@@ lu@@ dge is disp@@ osed and an additional pig@@ ment option to be able to hold the legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which are still clearly below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 .
stone cottages showed that in the low tide of waste in the three plants the expenditure for operation and maintenance &quot; was fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt was added to the market town of large entertainment costs during the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain a long @-@ term view , especially since the supply of the water @-@ purpose association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be extended by these systems , because it is a deficit facilities .
Bulgaria was posted in 8 months of inflation for the first time
national statistics show that inflation in Belarus was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the average annual average of last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in consumer goods has been observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and cultural ( 6,3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell with clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mob@@ ili@@ ar , household appliances and rout@@ ines ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cartoon criti@@ ci@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter Ani@@ me inspi@@ res is , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ur@@ si@@ gh opposite breeds .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows for about 150 million daily vehicles to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders the absur@@ d .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ miss@@ able , independent tools that generate more than 30 million improved self @-@ consuming devices per day .
all the failure to get to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved to criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face conve@@ ys or white skin would be able to be able to be able to be the most beautiful .
when this week , some U@@ sers put a filter to them , who gave them s@@ mu@@ zzle , wrong teeth and che@@ er@@ ous che@@ eks , some critics found a r@@ ass@@ able car@@ ic@@ ature of Asia - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y was referred to a larger problem , that the company has disp@@ arity with di@@ vers@@ ität .
the news and indignation was widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat provided that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended to be a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian .
but external , who experienced rac@@ ism , the filters of viol@@ ating cl@@ utch .
others voted the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail wrote Grace Save as@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student whose twe@@ et had widespread over the photos far , that the filter was viol@@ ently viol@@ ently un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ point of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter has not been yellow , but that the yellow face was moved into the most valuable extre@@ mes .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural galleries .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ ity and integration campaign , from conference rooms to Hollywood and equipment we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ shot big audience young people - those who are in pieces of race than their older opponents - might rather go out to expect awareness .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult to keep such things as it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided , who works as a product man@@ ag@@ ger and engineer for medium , her Snap@@ chat account to delete others to do the same .
in a book for medium and in a telephone interview she said they believe that r@@ ass@@ al @-@ related contro@@ vers@@ ities reflect a lack of di@@ vers@@ ities in the adjustment practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu criti@@ ci@@ zed the big part white , only male leader and finished her essay using a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their occupancy , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or feel right to say about what to say . &quot;
other share their opinion , an appeal , the snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce , and points to his status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set a personnel responsible , focused on re@@ iter@@ ate population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she is closed to her Snap@@ chat account and added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership S@@ ing IS@@ IS Secret service information , introduces the Committee of Congress
member of the United States Central Command and Climate Change of the United States Central Command , in order to record a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual states of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command intelligence analy@@ st , reported their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Service Information , which typically have been in@@ gen@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , were regularly expressed by American efforts against terrorism , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the guide error in Cent@@ Com goes up to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows a detailed technical problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama were given to change reports , how analysts look at the pressure from their pre @-@ laws , a optimi@@ stic image from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ sil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions , and statements before the congress were clearly defined as the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , there was a Cent@@ Com belonging to publicly known that a military retreat could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , Great City of Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so much clear . &quot; he said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a position .
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , Central Command informed the Central Command &apos;s tips to download the threat by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were played , analysts were concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights while the investigations will be continued .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
the democratic members of the Intelligence Advisory Committee released their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created a super@@ bly limited process for the creation of renov@@ ations on I@@ sil and Iraqi security services , &quot; a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Ship , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of the news service reports &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the mor@@ als under Analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivered little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence to have found any references to the White House at Cent@@ Com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon to the Pentagon master , which were recorded according to complaints by Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Press@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ torate is still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite dis@@ counted opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have agreed on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of last year , however , have had the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command Program of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criti@@ que concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remembered the dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush had seen a little of occupying troops in Iraq and had little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team of Mr. Hoo@@ ker reports that contrary to government officials , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
but this finding was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was criti@@ ci@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ atures due to its exc@@ essive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command at Central Command . Joseph L. V@@ otel was replaced .
the USA gains fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie gave also the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but b@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever had ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , this is what they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are simultaneously defeated in their group with the British on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide who will take part in the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed board gets a little longer from the path that will lead to the other group .
whatever the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising host of their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player from the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came in 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the jobs in London , which we now have .
we have able to catch the ru@@ gs completely .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a retreat from the local area .
India was without victory in the tournament went into the game , but the team showed itself surprising and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she finished a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and loaded the ball to the Americans for a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the por@@ ters of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will be on Saturday from the outcome of the next game .
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , just as late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and in@@ sof@@ tw@@ ist , a rapid relay change between competition and battle .
it is , when the olymp@@ ic torch itself is a burning rod , who is rescu@@ ed from the wrist@@ s to the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queu@@ e , without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ading y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could certainly have been sent among these well @-@ known names , built by sponsors and well @-@ made TV advertising when it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , figh@@ ts in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame does not aver@@ s any event any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shoot , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast and may rule it long .
but if I &apos;m a modest arguments for my particular lovers , then leave me attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tr@@ amp @-@ jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so many that I asked , didn &apos;t know that it is an Olympi@@ asp@@ ort@@ art at all .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ms .
although the United States sent athletes to contest , there has never been a medal at tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jumping competition and had a ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and Russians tend to be the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans share the ones for women .
Dong Dong in China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain outer scale , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ interrupted ear of a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ ess than the suitable for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a blo@@ om enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ist@@ ical potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous citrus of his never too end - but also the gra@@ z@@ ie of turn@@ around and dew that combines two sports , which is essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; is located by the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means that much means a &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , li@@ mb@@ s and sal@@ ut@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated according to official Olympics ap@@ ro@@ grams according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ lasting athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in the Rio .
the most common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the target , sometimes and back , up and down to the playground .
they do not only drive the line line or the output wall , but in the TV transfer there is another insight : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the targeted stre@@ aks is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ ati@@ ated , and it &apos;s enough to touch even a viewer .
but it &apos;s what I think even when looking at this games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a backward movement is not the target .
he or she spec@@ kl@@ ed , seem@@ ingly he@@ avi@@ est as an a@@ stron@@ aut , go to the top , then go down again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , not v@@ ault into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant re@@ vocation of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , likewise at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the du@@ ck as part of a afternoon block of two days from 14.00 .
in the middle of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably over@@ look the general tum@@ ult .
if the magn@@ itude of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxi@@ ety and the objective of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his home to air , new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally ally of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters that demand political changes in Ethiopia pushed on violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that the protests were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia straight together ?
in the past ten years , one of the most stable countries of Africa was one of the most stable countries of Africa and a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government shook the country and far more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and desired fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was un@@ merciful .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on fire un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , the videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show such as security of young people with sho@@ cks , while these were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN authority for Human Rights requires a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had everything else as a model for democracy , human rights organisations have continued the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents have been effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or put into prison , killing or put into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have other options , apart from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m T@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
one generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil usage to the wor@@ ms with regard to power of the reg@@ ent coalition .
following a significantly critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
at the same time the tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ ack@@ ened , disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ tics fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced more or less forced to arm the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of the bitter st@@ amping after years of age is now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years there were very many Ethiop@@ ians in the position to communicate with the social media , since cheap smartphones were always more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about the internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they hold themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave their way to the protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ ni@@ as in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Ethiopia the Am@@ har@@ ah , who come from e@@ op@@ ia mainly to Christian high countries , in the politics and the economy , while they took off the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and in shallow regions .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are involved in co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the greatest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the ti@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , in the trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is death from Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
until his death in 2012 , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the prime minister of Ethiop@@ ians in the year 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as tac@@ tic gen@@ ius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was especially sealed in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special author@@ ization to edit enemies and to make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing to this basic program , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ ush &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region north of Ethiop@@ ians , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ tics say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the ba@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government , seem@@ ingly confirmed by the government and then stolen from the government .
during the following ra@@ ids many Protest@@ ants were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively quickly over .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but apparently this did not have the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray run shops and the hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is becoming increasingly common in the social media .
analysts say that protests are the US and other Western allies in a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if it has recently distributed that it closed this basis .
while the West definitely wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want that his ally break@@ up in an already volat@@ ile neighborhood .
&quot; this , &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin cat@@ walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his statement of Obama &apos;s IS@@ IS was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign repeated that his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fication threw new questions regarding the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans whether he was able to communicate and under@@ stand@@ able to communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings its competitors , who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain to the original position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the hin@@ ge on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the president and Mrs. Clinton created IS@@ IS .
but in early mor@@ nings on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he is simply Sardin@@ ian .
as opposed to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the exc@@ use seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ m Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t &apos;s Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to overthrow the statement by doing so that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate would not know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism caught on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries the focus of its campaign because of falling change@@ over values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
in Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk bor@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already launched Sar@@ kas@@ mus already in his defense .
in late July , he moved strong criticism when he said that Russians should h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ mails , however he explained later &quot; Nat@@ zwe@@ iler . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limitations in politics and then back to rowing .
&quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans are taken , and then , if necessary , &quot; according to how the reaction is falling . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who watches the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ending the sound for the Presi@@ dential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has yet accepted a lot of their sound because its envel@@ opes have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ head in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics frequently to susp@@ end his statements or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is intensi@@ fied the focus of attention in the last months of his Presi@@ dential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal Mit@@ er to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent examples , had great effort to defend the candidates at a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says is legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization before Obama was called IS@@ IS , he called her back@@ wards , completely wrong , so it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ instream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government served as Foreign Minister as Foreign Minister , it allowed IS@@ IS to extend the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive under control .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them on each of his words and to be pre@@ set against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television expert , who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats hit via Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps to exc@@ use as a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential Office .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a spar@@ king café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was displaced .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sold soap of Cup@@ cakes .
native trau@@ ma as the last loss in a gent@@ leman &apos;s city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still believe that C@@ ole is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also new .
a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered a client to al@@ locate money for a new external attack , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept many things .
Ver@@ b used the same distributor for the excav@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lights from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ n like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions .
there are natur@@ alistic code .
the café is served no more beer , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noted a electricity to old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee st@@ ink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was the coffee and the culture of the ver@@ b that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea at that day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ter always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Foto Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t regard a G@@ roll that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has provided a special soap for Ver@@ b with the ch@@ ill coffee of the caf@@ és as an ingre@@ dient .
&quot; I think we will still go into their offer , &quot; she said .
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the men@@ ue card into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he previously prepared to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has more advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the coffee in the fridge and sell coffee in the fridge .
there is a chance that the café has expanded to an adjoining building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was born and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of the restaurant and the ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland .
its menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pure@@ e and as a dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by Chinese cuisine in the USA during Zi@@ egel@@ man told her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they exhibited culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop , a small , s@@ ör@@ gy i@@ mb@@ iss at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the business since the IPO in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh water sand@@ wich with olive pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pure@@ e and vegetable mixture .
when the repor@@ ter ordered Hack@@ te , this was suitable for a discussion about the meal in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingre@@ dient and a little cheap , which access the ingre@@ dient .
imagine how many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women boiled for male Fel@@ dar@@ es and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans that sent food to hunger during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the roads with which the country went round , not to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans became a central , r@@ ins@@ ed theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same way , the new Bud@@ get@@ te was the new Bud@@ get@@ ary : mysterious foods such as bread and sounds were re@@ compens@@ ated to basic food , the casserole as &quot; wonderful Art , Ess@@ enti@@ re@@ lics , &quot; it perceived that co@@ oks could be hidden under a wat@@ ery sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ ob@@ st .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen , became very rare luxury .
their own mixtures were tried , because a cal@@ orie rich and healthy satisfaction was su@@ pre@@ emin@@ ent to taste or even healthy food .
during their research on the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man made a court of this epoch , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no more popular supplement in the lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann leads further : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions not fit together .
it was typical for many of the weather conditions .
like never before or ever since Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating habits of the country have alike .
in order to transform their recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to transform themselves together with the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e such cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the answer by the government are star@@ ving to star@@ ve citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ stance .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant homes in his kitchen , he sp@@ un like the million@@ th heavy man of the world , to which he became .
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was wonderful real@@ ities .
President Roosevelt might have sinned the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ise him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the today &apos;s house@@ keeper performs in no interest in flav@@ ours by wife Roosevelt , that the White House made the d@@ ull food in Washington , but also one of the most tro@@ phy . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was rejected , once the country came back onto the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science was applied to food .
the pair was better understood at the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law , for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall in the country .
after the plates were cleared in Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , which he ate Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; there is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , a modest recipes to be missed .
there were no failed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ pped something opposed to a spoon into the fence , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t really bad .
CO@@ E repeated three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ese he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs @-@ attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own lives to the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died at an end @-@ end attack against the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; , a civil war group that has saved the lives of almost 60,000 people according to the picture paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers make their own lives on the game to pulling people from dist@@ orted houses and to make their first aid in the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civilian protective which shows him for a 11 hour rescue of a house from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it did the Syrians for g@@ lowing symbolic figure in the he@@ bre@@ wing of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when heroes has never seen himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ters have cast four seals on the Alz@@ ette District , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that not children are playing , &quot; quoted the image his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to follow terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland we usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the s@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is floating at a speed of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
in Greenland we get offspring with a offspring of 150 .
the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes in an average of 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes up , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal accelerates to a total of 2.6 km / h - and is as fast as a Rob@@ be with this top speed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time of lon@@ el@@ iness , the lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal Science &quot; in any of a Greenland which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ ae@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this life span means for vert@@ eb@@ rates a world record .
indeed , the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist thought that Greenland will be rocky .
only missing the evidence .
it is hard to observe , after all , they live primarily in the ice Sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
according to the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know little .
her time pul@@ ls , as they rent six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard , six animals with a transmitter .
nevertheless , this shar@@ ks like this : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be ; another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young ic@@ orn .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice Sea and are looking for cad@@ re , which are from higher water layers down to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland which took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard , at the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long while the largest 502 centim@@ eter measured .
to determine the age of the animals , it analyzed the lin@@ ol@@ ines of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens has already been produced before the birth of the shar@@ ks which contained in it later is no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had much carbon @-@ 14 in the liner core .
their birth should therefore be in the early 1960s when nuclear weapons try to s@@ lugg@@ ish large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 centimeters in length , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in the year 2012 .
in their lin@@ ens , there were normal carbon @-@ 14 levels in their lin@@ ens , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland age of 335 , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 502 centimeters will be even 3@@ 92 years old .
the Greenland @-@ females only get offspring if they are more than four meters , it was known .
now the researchers of the length could be assigned an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters will probably be at the threshold for sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland with the over@@ flow obviously requires at least one and a half centuries .
this may also be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters , is no coincidence .
even the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , put under his che@@ que on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism is often run on as@@ fl@@ es living there .
they attack later - and slow@@ est slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often become very large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface , using the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as soon as possible as many descendants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building soil in a double pack
with issues around the building , the community at the youngest session has been focusing on the most recent meeting .
with relief , the Panel received the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , finally , the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ lists and land@@ fill issues and the applications could be applied , the sale of land @-@ plots in the residential areas &quot; road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - mining section 1 ) is no longer interested in any interested parties .
the community is convinced that the b@@ unk@@ ers in the rural and peaceful residential community of Schön@@ au young families and other seniors are equally competitive .
as it was said , you can sign up immediately in the City Hall , via the awarding of the par@@ c@@ els , the council is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to develop further en@@ quiries to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial enterprises , with the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided to re @-@ modify the newly created domestic product plan in partial areas in the spring of this year .
in the area of Lower @-@ time , the industrial area is extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benef@@ ited from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of Main is therefore the best chance to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ Countries , Head of Compet@@ ence Award Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU .
to date , the so @-@ called EU Pass goes to so far the approval in the UK .
this just use big US banks .
several banks have already announced to store jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs at the Main in five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector less important than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ Countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg , a large fund sector , cut to the infrastructure as well as Dublin as well as Dublin .
in Frankfurt , thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
the city with easily available industrial property management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial property management are 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer , the town stands for seventh place , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even though life quality is a question of the pre@@ ference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt will attract other banks and investors &quot; as well as the I@@ W .
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s vote I will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researcher .
there are also the forces of dealers : in London , according to the numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal cost from the hepatitis C Patent @-@ Mer@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. official judge decided that Gilead is a claim to the refund of the legal costs which you created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gal@@ a@@ ad was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge had a pattern of ab@@ norm@@ ality by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ eth@@ ical actions .
at the survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. official in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman told that Gilead is entitled to decree the cost , which emerged during the defense of the F@@ alles .
Mer@@ ck tries to bal@@ ancing the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medic@@ ations which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took other coun@@ ties and owned each other for laboratory work , in whom Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r admitted , the active ingre@@ dient in the medic@@ ations of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax return for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in the demo@@ crats in the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ tons donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated revenue of USD 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister gave a income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ics candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax expl@@ aining the last ten years .
they paid a 20.@@ 3 % effective Federal tax rate in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons of Kamp@@ ag@@ es@@ hel@@ pers were announced in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a cro@@ se , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false expres@@ sions and retreat in terms of previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is custom@@ ary for US Presi@@ dential information to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York businessman , and his attor@@ neys have stated a control examination by the control authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; he wrote Clin@@ ics Ele@@ ctor hel@@ pers in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate in the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N that he would not allow tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed .

on Thursday , she spoke the subject of a speech in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate in the past decades did , and his tax returns to publish . &quot; she said to the crowd .
politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump has not been paid during the 1990s for two years , and a journalist in the New York Times quoted a series of tax fraud and tax advis@@ ers that this could always be the case .
Federal taxes have become a theme in the electoral struggle .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren , who would ensure that persons who pay more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .

the method has proven itself as effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had developed the idea for years ago , has trained with the US natural protection and trained by volunteers in North Tanzania , a non @-@ violent amp to protect their homes and harvest@@ ing without sacrific@@ ing animals .
before that many spe@@ ars have used to defend itself .
Friday is a telephone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in this communities , whereby it is much more visible that they can hold the eleph@@ ants of their own fields , without injury , &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps cover the light of the eleph@@ ants with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when it is not afraid , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ili@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel , because Israeli general election was removed after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; collection - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots cap@@ tiv@@ ated a media watch after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli fore@@ choice since it had requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Memorial , &quot; Shoah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay the Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the country @-@ selection list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed in between countries listed directly from the hotel rooms .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol is offering a possibility to select Israel via its own call centre .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel indicated that the measure has been a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels . &quot;
the reason that stood behind it dissolved even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called it a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and were dis@@ ma@@ stered .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ fully .
the fact that this is carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
no explanation is required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions draws , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where the people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel explained that there would have been an alleged Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he named it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located on the no@@ isy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel demonstrated fast all the alle@@ g@@ ations from itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interro@@ gation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to include Israel in the quick@@ est list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code was now added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading volume between Moscow and Teheran , in the year , rose by 7@@ 0.9 per cent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest rate of Russian companies grew strongly on shops in the country , the ambassador shared with us .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
of course , the further trade building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
it noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran during the first five months of the year 2016 fell by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading post was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign citizen issued approximately 35,000 vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record @-@ amount of Japanese tourists in Russia be broken off from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russian Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador is hoping that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

four stages have been done .
in order to bri@@ dged the time until the next Rom@@ antic trip of all Minist@@ ries in the past two years , the minist@@ erial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare for a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various gel@@ ding destinations were reviewed and one decided to visit the bishop of Freiburg , where this year , at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy the Mer@@ cy of Mer@@ cy on the Frei@@ burger Münster , a special fung@@ us target was offered .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heilig@@ enstadt are on the way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration at St. Anna , he blessed the pilgrimage and divided the fung@@ us .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train at the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster &apos;s wife is standing , and so the pilgri@@ m was stepped down from the town of Münster .

sh@@ otte Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner &apos;s stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner was last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the spark @-@ role , who had made his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend proud of stor@@ med home for a victory of the Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic chess medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in London in March , despite the back of the back of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ d .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man when they stayed when they saw the potential in the sc@@ orn , which now has un@@ folds .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and S@@ kin@@ ner , put in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard round winner the New Zealand were victorious in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn was almost back , but Kenn@@ y delivered the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner held it .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , with the exec@@ utions passed in a higher gear to slow it and to allow it to keep pace and to keep the tempo .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as an BBC expert and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they got up to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
in the final round , we have prepared a Olympi@@ ord and defeated the world champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave that he fell on the track after a weak start .
he moved this saying later , and there was no obj@@ ection by England Riv@@ als .
there was no problem with this victory in such a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels complete with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e such as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so bad with so many cos@@ tit@@ els that it was incredible to win again during the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days at the bicycle current .
with the shape Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) were born - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little effort to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts in the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified to compete with the fastest power in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they came to the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will be focusing on safety .
he was disputed yesterday with reference before the qualification , when they called him to measure his height .
in the respective Women &apos;s competition , which continues to be continued tomorrow , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Summit in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving his strong railway wheel team to domin@@ ate the medium period of the Olympic Games and take a band of medals .
after an exceptional figure of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were gone down .
it was drama in the background , thus the resignation of the technical conductor Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex and mobil@@ is@@ ins as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like that now the legendary name GB@@ S , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated .
future of the melt of Portland due to the lifting of energy consumption
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game since the system operators will terminate the energy contract and thus complete all delivery contracts , as the supplier of the supplier is shared .
this step was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to be commissioned .
a maximinum payout for 20 years is set out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are located on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk at risk .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ effects because the melting y consumes around 10 percent of the total generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A completed the Point Henry melt , which led the last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melt @-@ down of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a clamping force .
this step follows the long spec@@ ulations concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which is the big aluminium mel@@ on with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that there will be three other owners to terminate their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority owned by AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L comes from that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting y means , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L still said that the contracts so @-@ called &quot; backup transactions are to be in force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; hence AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the income , &quot; said the electricity supply .
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are limited by the progn@@ oses of strong appointment markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared with the value of tre@@ aties already in its annual withdrawal of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a notice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the melt or the power supply to the melt @-@ down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not inter@@ fere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a statement , why it has been withdrawn from the contract .
analysts are war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the analy@@ tics at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland use approximately 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago approximately 900 megawatts of electricity per year .
if both systems should disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , sound is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sept@@ ation of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the latest news on her inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a space full of people that I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an on@@ ical family ) ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ l@@ yn and in presence of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ er@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister , which ends with a classic turn .
this is the cl@@ assy hand held for almost any birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ rest presented the set , &quot; You did that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; , with the hon@@ esty of an animation at 8 o &quot; clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in their own media city .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began .
K@@ end@@ all Great sister Kim likes her to take over what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league .
the September edition is for Vo@@ gue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( according to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 8@@ 32 pages of the market ( 615 pages advertising ) .
the dis@@ closure of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to see the fact that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still dro@@ wned before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Moss .
over the past few years , there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities that mo@@ ths &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ity times are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador for Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even during the small chance that Mr@@ s J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; passage of its generation &quot; - under the previous category , it is in good company .
this celebr@@ ity times are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today to know how to twi@@ sted a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is tigh@@ tened to jets ) .
they are really talented women to mark themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers would not like to anyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position was always ten@@ sion@@ ed in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings sounds too high , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the failure to recover seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your Grun@@ dation of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold from her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in her free time she is to be seen in the reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community study sites have a yearly 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the people need to have more than 160.000 of the country are rejected by the municipal law firms , while the sector makes the impact of further aver@@ ages due to over@@ load transactions .
in Queens@@ land three of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust Del@@ og@@ ations and those who are looking for free legal advice and legal help .
legal services of the congregation , which are already busy already , make up for further cuts .
as of June next year it is foreseen that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their funds .
the director of the municipal law of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell reported that thousands of people have been rejected by people every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse in the government without a repe@@ al decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Queens@@ land Municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave rob@@ ber@@ ty relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families who were released by divi@@ ders , workers , the un@@ justified way - all these people have problems right way and this survey shows that they can not get the help you need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will be cut by 30 per cent , meaning that thousands of helpful people from Queens@@ land means to be forced to return with their legal problems without any help .

Berlin / Schwerin : lost pol@@ l in front of countries : SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for government agencies S@@ DP and CD@@ U are characterized .
this made representative surveys for the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Picture &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black governing coalition could continue to reign close to the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and had thus have good chances to continue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vor@@ p@@ ommern , the SPD ranged from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years .
according to the survey , the party is only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U that could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens once again come into the heavy country &apos;s Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented in the country &apos;s day , with 3 percent each .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD came to only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
therefore , they are going back to the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent the first time at the Chamber of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Time Period : the Nokia Communic@@ ator has arrived on the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and much , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty qui@@ cker .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight Meg@@ abytes , which would now be enough for about two tablets with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with a minimum of 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros you can buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age .
20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced a couple of months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax it was the Communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser , even if it is slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded as a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile pf@@ one of the Finn@@ s had an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market domin@@ ate the market today , who came all much later than Nokia .
wherever you are online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for itself alone 555 million units .
the worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company are coming .
in the meantime , around the smartphone is now an entire industry .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a internet communication , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
Apple began the triumph@@ al train of Apple , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had to be seen .
it finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen is now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ pru@@ dent for 20 years after his invention .
today , every German player is looking at 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn the smartphone even time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina bul@@ let , in Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the permanent accessi@@ bility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only available in our local municipalities and throughout London , but in the whole country of renew@@ ing and prosperity .
for me , this is the greatest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just like that in 2012 in London , when we operated a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and again , we will achieve new possibilities for local @-@ resident companies and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local churches , we already have 10,000 new apprentices to create 40,000 new jobs and create an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such to think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too large .
it was told me that England is never ready for the games , and that we will da@@ zzle us on the world stage .
the two branches were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but he@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth , and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in all UK .
we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of the infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 that was built in the middle of the two frequency test runs of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running step , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit , and expand He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ Game &quot; regarding ad block
for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ age money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ play . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it might update their filter in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook , Facebook announced that his des@@ kt@@ on would change the coding in regard to its advertising display in order to identify it displays that part of the page advertising is difficult to be difficult .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to get the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the present@@ able open source community and the re@@ he@@ aters has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers in progress , and it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest business for social media has dropped into the struggle , is a strong indication of how it has become ob@@ liter@@ ated display of the sector .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ i@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people in the world , according to a study conducted in the past year , almost four times as much 2013 .
at 1.@@ 03 billion , active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertising is 84 percent of the range of fac@@ tual fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks .
the company has an ad block on Desktop PC , apart from mobile display block , no effect on Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , it shared a spokes@@ person .
advertisement on Desktop PC makes a sufficiently large share of revenues , so Facebook is worth the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would be updated to be his &quot; ad pre@@ ference &quot; to have more control of them on them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would provide new filters , because they would also block the contents on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no positive experience for the user , so we plan to arrange the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Spe@@ aker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a m@@ ute means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to place more control into the hands of the people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide bom@@ ber on the Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on the highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near the V@@ aud canton , near the V@@ aud canton .
a woman laid down in the dark , &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was accompanied by several vehicles , including a truck , was forced to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , the police , those as well as any witnesses of the incident , were reported to report .
an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the G@@ illes court yard of the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , if one of the driver will appear .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the Prosecutor has to decide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the court yard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be drawn to responsibility .
in each of the two cases , a person in the Dark On@@ es ran on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to go out that pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of the night as it was in the newspaper .
last year a pol@@ ishing was acquitted of the negli@@ gent kill@@ ings after she had passed a man and killed , who was at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court noted that the police officers - who had reply to an emergency call -- a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predi@@ ctable situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information regarding the incident at Thursday near Morges should report on the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate models , Venus was likely to inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms , similar to those of climate authorities .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could be referred to as similar conditions .
scientists have previously imp@@ aired that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and turned slowly over .
the model illuminated also the top ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protective even more quickly .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from the sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus its daily page of the sun nearly two months &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella on the surface of a large of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average @-@ temperatures that are some degree cooler than the Earth today .
the model produced a story of the Venus that resembles the evolution that had previously assumed by Plan@@ ets .
although it was most likely to be inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light exposed .
its oceans has evap@@ or@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen dropped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophy@@ si@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

in the course of summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he also has to have an appropriate decision on decisions which affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Z@@ acc@@ ic who had been hired by Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked his contributions for the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the winner of the League of Jack Adams Awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 , as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the Club to 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs in Minnesota and missed in each of the two last years the night season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are exposed to the remun@@ eration for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ ders , while all parties rely on the table for a new talk round at the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neg@@ oti@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the wood @-@ service providers ( Wood Group ) were carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt unions can confirm that we have agreed to a new statement about the current battle process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some time sessions held in the next few weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to re@@ start the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Group has reduced its rates to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rat@@ ory reduction follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that extra cuts of the company needed the required space to come across the market down@@ turn .
for his part of thousands of people , Shell has announced plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ cred@@ itation measures with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are based on lower crude oil prices under pressure , a economic situation which by the British decided to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the largest working disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a business that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected to spend new projects in the North Sea as compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star enh@@ ancing of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler &apos;s space teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue on rotor rates among the stars of the star enh@@ ancing of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star enh@@ ancing are at different rates as well as in which relation to the rot@@ ational periods of the planet .
&quot; we hope that we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star Wars of the P@@ lei@@ ades is about 445 years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they are now fastest on the fastest one .
at top rates , these ri@@ f@@ ading stars hit great amounts of star winds .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is shaken , his rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star , by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a visible star@@ ring -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that a more massive star slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ghts turn off as smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that long rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas on faster rotary recept@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star enh@@ ancing of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ m laboratory to compare positions as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star enh@@ ancing of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers a anch@@ ors for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a lot more about us how that like , when , when and why stars break their rotation rates slow@@ down , so speak to their &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star appears
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional back@@ log announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro is fought against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos;@@ Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; , declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ Star Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been awarded 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
he served as a consultant and youth coach until the end of December 31 , 2017 , in future as a consultant and youth coach .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with power .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es in some milestones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded in the s@@ add@@ an hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was disputed on the field so cont@@ ested is his appearance outside of the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was given to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; to have served ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sk@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the principal susp@@ ect for years to have received over an anti @-@ A@@ ging clinic in South Florida to promote performance .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league might have done myself a pleasure for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez says at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the great stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the Bank .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; says Y@@ an@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympath@@ y of fans of the Y@@ an@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want a @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team .

Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are exceeded by the first official di@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught ath@@ lete had almost won a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases have become known to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ es@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ob@@ in@@ ski were tested positive and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de had been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ ating means for di@@ op@@ ing@@ les .
on Friday afternoon , the International sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupies the fourth place in the final above 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the foo@@ th@@ ills about 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing in the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ tos from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to work with the International German Federal Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the message turned over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is supposed to act with the forbidden substance to act blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended pro@@ vision@@ ally , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample has already been positive .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov was informed immediately with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
thus , around all the weights of the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation may not take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ob@@ in@@ ski &quot; was also known , the London Olympics Champion in Class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had a positive effect on the an@@ ab@@ olic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both den@@ ces the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes it is especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further heavy blow for the rep@@ utation of the entire sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had also under@@ going the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic di@@ op@@ ings , also the runner @-@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming pool , in addition , the earlier clubs in China had so@@ aked for heavy disputes between athletes .
thus , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt l@@ ila . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;

dat@@ alog@@ y : so per@@ fi@@ de re@@ pressing h@@ acker its rans@@ om
programmer from compres@@ sive malware access currently targeted companies - and are succe@@ eding in doing so successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware air defence specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once at least once , partly several victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been aiming at ran@@ som@@ atic goods .
40 percent of the victims are willing to re@@ adily receive the funds required by the Daily Money , in order to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of the artist , the perpet@@ rators are specialized on attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential @-@ to @-@ press release is considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most painters were still able to send advertising to advertising .
then the perpet@@ rator discovered the express software for itself .
only private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it is looking for a long @-@ long modified files such as Word@@ Press , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the Er@@ pres@@ ser .
to get the end key code to the files , the victim must be money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ ating bit@@ coin - ski@@ p .
however , where personal use is the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production stands still closed .
accordingly , the damage falls below , if a Ran@@ som@@ ware strike .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt the business activities , with a case people were in danger of danger .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , that only the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the company .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this , and try to build a good report .
in a recent study , the security researcher of F @-@ Secure have examined the user surface areas and contact with the presses and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims of chat as they can pay with bit@@ coin , in@@ accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t freely for example files .
and if private people are redeemed by a few hundred euros , companies will have to pay hard negoti@@ ate and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data without turn@@ key .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk winnings from the Ran@@ som@@ ware supply , h@@ acker are always professional and share the work , explains security experts Che@@ ster Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons .
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software tool to the real er@@ pres@@ ser .
the previous malware @-@ kits were created by Malware himself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scope of delivery is a custom@@ ization tool that can be changed to smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the presses are looking for further h@@ acker to distribute the newly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so , in one of the forums in the underground , you buy the set of a crime and asked for another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is carried out per in@@ ert calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als carry out sp@@ inning with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known to many companies that keep their data better .
more than 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT facilities in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware may be able to withdraw using a file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already following new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful vom@@ iting alone , the perpet@@ rators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ra boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the potential of damage depending on the type of data is more multiple than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators of the future could take completely new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , how they could get a thermo@@ stat under the Internet .
in the middle of the winter , the application of a der@@ art @-@ block heating could certainly be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware may also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ proof
Honda wants to pack everything in the little HR V : a little SUV , a little Coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although it is only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in a lot of space , it works closely on no spot .
the materials of the inside area are well @-@ processed and can work pleasant , only the cockpit of the cockpit falls there something .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not only a caffeine room of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ provided and 10@@ 26 l with folded back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded as kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space that is about 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor .
the boot space is well loaded , but the loading height with a height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp will accelerate the HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
however , his work is likely to judge a little qui@@ eter .
gr@@ ati@@ fying is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive will not be offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering might be a bit direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; does not require any need to be desired .
the City emergency braking system is part of the state @-@ emergency braking system ( working until Tempo 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the trace systems .
sometimes , the coll@@ isions war@@ med up , sometimes , because he has evaluated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ed@@ ging objects . &quot;
very reliable , the TV assistant is very reliable .
and intelligent tempo regul@@ ators respon@@ ds to the traffic detection and thr@@ ottle the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI socket are lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
if you don &apos;t want to invest in so much , the gasoline engine will receive € 20,000 , the diesel from € 2@@ 3000 .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car with the HR @-@ V .
airline is not liable : fall on the passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger at the passenger bridge .
as a liability is only possible for haz@@ ards that are typical for air traffic , the Ober@@ national Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken out at the fall of a knee .
however , the accident could have happen anywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
illness : when paid the organizer
in order to get ill , they only get money back when the cause of the disease is without doubt to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have seen the same symptoms .
in the hearing case a family was heavily damaged in the second day of its Turkish lau@@ tern , severely affected by di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective water treatment which allegedly contamin@@ ated the se@@ a@@ water .
the family was the view , the trip was so defective - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ ers .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the Court .
indeed , the plain@@ ti@@ ary situation in fact was defective .
but the organis@@ er knew only shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the sentence .
especially in the samples of the water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens through infection with one another - belong to the general risk of life .
out of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 people were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people wor@@ ried about further proposals .
the state had to bes@@ ee@@ ching the state and to react at the same time .
safe is : our country will answer the violence of the do@@ ers with hatred and split .
we will not give this triumph to the terror@@ ists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country qui@@ cker the country , but the security and strength of the population will also have the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve an implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
he also announced a further person@@ alisation of security forces , namely &quot; in a medium term order of over several years . &quot;
for terrorism we must be under sentence .
video surveillance should be improved , which means that the weapons will be so amended for the purchase of weapons on the internet .
the last much discussed silence for doctors should continue to remain after de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
however , in the dialogue with the doctors , he wants to search for solutions as the end@@ an@@ gering of citizens could reduce , he said with look at the psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social care provider for assistance .
teachers would have to be prepared better on how to use trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning an investig@@ ator for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chief Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior decided to have pronounced against shareholders .
&quot; this was a bu@@ ck@@ ling for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship .
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness it is un@@ constitutional problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t miss all that you refuse , and I back@@ rest the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Chief of Simone Peter designed the minister , he would like to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terrorism packages and action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Left Party Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of prover@@ bs and a deep@@ ening of the judgment to the right bring people in this land no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better transport to the motorway
it is located regularly on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the ab@@ bre@@ wing is supposed to be extended .
this is good news for all car . driver , who stand at the surrounding traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the st@@ au , when they go through the motorway of the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road building extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and exit Wes@@ ley street the legal rec@@ umbent lane at 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : traffic shares an early spring , thus improving the tot@@ t of the exp@@ iry of the current section of the German road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Per@@ spective , Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous before all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g path and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic will only be accompanied by a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned from a three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the required load capacity to record the heavy @-@ load bil@@ ingual .
as long as this engagement , which is associated with it , it cannot tell a constant state of operations .
however , to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official residual use of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bi@@ eg@@ yl@@ ur , the country is aware of the traffic weaker time in school holidays because with disabilities be expected .
the traffic will run on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ IMA &apos;s club allows people to visit people with mig@@ rant and refugee children , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; intercultural trip &quot; - 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age visited the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to cultural integration by adolescents with migration and refugee children to the goal of visiting schools with welcome classes the possibility to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the adolescents in the class will be between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animated it would have been possible to follow the action course nevertheless , so the press release of the Young Theatre in Münster .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the young theatre will work together as part of a musical theatre project in the coming season .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background are to receive the opportunity to visit profession@@ ally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , show and music .
offers for children and families in the field of the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language transmission are planned .
the project &quot; intercultural trip &quot; goes on .
in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association ends with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ing : hope on weather need
the weather had the star edge Gu@@ ards in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a rich man through the bill - yet there is hope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain , to observe the b@@ aff@@ le of heaven , said the chair of the observ@@ atory in Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday afternoon .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll definitely see many star@@ ds at the sky .
it is about Per@@ ei@@ des that belong to the fastest star@@ ds with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , there are hours for hours , at night there is a long time in the morning , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one comes with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten percent are often feeling of sleep or permanently and not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep problems , and there may be various reasons based , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ eze , member of the German Society for Su@@ ff@@ or@@ ation and Medicine .
what one under@@ stands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an entry and a sleep@@ y distur@@ b@@ ance .
in fact , many people can sleep well as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Haus@@ smann association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el says .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep problems are complex .
beyond that , organic , psychological or galvan@@ ized factors , but also plug@@ ging drugs .
not rarely is the sleeping expression of another condition .
&quot; very early @-@ w@@ aking , especially with a depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors are inter@@ connected to each other .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can really lie , aw@@ akes all two to three hours and starts to bl@@ ur@@ ge on all day problems and make sure that there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore .
when should one work with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
if anyone does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week and on the day , he should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look different . it is un@@ defeated , tired , un@@ folding , has difficulty with the attention and the concentration , is easily charming , has voting rights or physical complaints such as stomach or heada@@ che .
in order to relie@@ ve bed@@ interference , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classical sleeping tablets only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ quiries .
in Germany , there are hardly documented sleep in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ xer , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why one should now turn to sleep problems at bed@@ bugs , av@@ eng@@ ed We@@ e@@ eze .
the one can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for an investigation in sleep laboratory , physician , for example , at s@@ nor@@ ing with respiratory irrit@@ ation , in case of path@@ ogen@@ ic day@@ ability , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep@@ y distur@@ bing , explained spru@@ ce .
one does not need to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ bers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the wiring , one goes to the bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electro@@ des in the body you have a no@@ str@@ ates , a chest strap and a fe@@ el@@ ler on the finger .
furthermore , a camera draws to the ceiling on the ceiling .
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a number of shafts , where you can attach to a better sleep .
wh@@ ites counts on : regular bed@@ time and rise time , not too long in bed , not to sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch television to sleep , alcohol depart , and at night not at the clock - then you start to expect , and that &apos;s all and not eligible .
what is the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold a dis@@ appo@@ inting from Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was brought gold to the first world championships in Doha at the same time and presented his first world record at the same time .
in particular , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has placed his former ex @-@ team mate to the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € for reward and a jun@@ cture of 150,000 € should not be surprised about lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday on his Facebook page .
the conve@@ ying system in the swimming pool is bad , the di@@ op@@ ing@@ controls were very good .
this means that we can not compete with countries that promote very much and do not even operate at d@@ oping , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , it would have to be reported nine months before his first launch by the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly that one should keep it with countries .

airport : bonds of bags
professional Thi@@ eves at the Airport Düsseldorf
the civil service of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and bags of baggage .
at 21.@@ 30 pm , civil servants recognised a band in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport , which was known for police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy in mid @-@ July of this year , and were gener@@ alized , working and especially profession@@ ally .
the specialists of the crime @-@ Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can review the di@@ pl@@ ets , who had traveled to Germany for the purpose of criminal off@@ ences after Germany .
they took a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ mu@@ gs , a couple of lin@@ den trees , in the meantime is another head of pil@@ es : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in works on the first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous villages &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east along the west , you &apos;ll get to play tennis courts , a refresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; he spra@@ yed .
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished soon , is already being built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; trendy Born district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in calls , but in the last weeks , however , pre@@ fers with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 . once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents rental contracts , on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , Berlin &apos;s Inn@@ u@@ en@@ ator had been committed several times for a tough advance of police against the project investigating the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , according to the police three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 senior officials and three team cars before the site , closed parts of the road and held visitors to the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , its renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owner the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers moved under the jew@@ ish of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street acts peaceful : parents go with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain to the late end .
very close to the skin projects are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are mainly attributable to the police presence .
they share the care of rising and genetic engineering with the inhabitants of the skin projects .
it sounds not according to a p@@ ant@@ z who wanted to hin@@ der majority pol@@ ishing in front of v@@ andal@@ ous Left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ u@@ en@@ ator and the police are going up between home and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which today also has a lower average temperature and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
also Haus@@ smann and the resulting living projects are already long to the Kiev : in 1990 numerous houses in the former East Germany were occupied , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared among the large police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still occupied by people still occupied by people , which they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years became increasingly popular for tourists and election liner from all over the world : with them now residents of the GDR @-@ times and former house occupied their jaw .
this also is noticeable in the rent , which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ ers are being attacked as symbols for these developments : they det@@ ects them into the cut discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades which were shot with colours .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for this , that not all neighbours must consider this as a problem , that they are not to be affected by crimin@@ ality : offen@@ ders , such as body viol@@ ability , according to statistics , according to statistics .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make changes of damage that ten@@ ds to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , there is no talk of un@@ certainty .
if violence is concerned , it is most important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been this .
the famous burning cars also give it no longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this architect , her street is not a criminal firing , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more from each other , as elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ s Straße - and remained .
that is why it was so important that local residents receive their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who all suddenly stressed the Deut@@ ch sho@@ ots over the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by the face of new@@ buildings in former building g@@ aps that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the original apartments that are not interesting for many people - here are more people living here , which are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not have gu@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should one do , if never hear@@ eth any man ?
then on all sides fru@@ stration is present , also by the police and the inhabitants .
for accessi@@ bility that likes to paint over paint bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev .
those who come here should be aware of it - just like someone who passes into a pub area , can be perceived through noise on noise .
all only presented with pre@@ names were asked to be called , not to be called by their real name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee contractor
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact associations in the case of integration and organis@@ er .
Moreover , she is a social worker at the site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee contractor for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical supports the management of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group for refugees , administration , authorities , and who else are mi@@ xes .
Reg@@ ine Client of the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is more than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the jeal@@ ous@@ y , who has a problem in particular .
so some - less sp@@ inning than much attention to the multitude of problems would be targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the site .
we searched for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long@@ time experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous@@ y pleas@@ e@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is an organization , work with the people in front of the site and also behind the scenes as well as grid activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it took a 50 @-@ percent place for three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ours and main actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be located at the Was@@ enstraße
a grave problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the connecting pl@@ ough@@ s that have been recognized .
in charge of the connection , the municipalities are in charge .
you must fit the refugees in your own or rented residential area .
the costs for the construction , the rent or renovation of these properties must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the land council with the Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto you find no private apartments .
it did not function so far so that one has dependent on private apartments , then Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community homes have to be renewed , as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will soon be installed in the basin .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm lead , there are inter@@ iors , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and compensation activities for refugees and migrants who need to be set up or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , complete non@@ profit work - and motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not mean work , but not only work .
the day need a strong structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and client .
people would need to develop an imp@@ ec@@ ent feeling .
so there are offers such as sport , contacts with locals and mainly language course .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so I jump administration and volunteer here .
it is centr@@ alised that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it will take it , and it can make the period sensible , for example , with language courses .
who sometimes cannot help the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , but may not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
problem fail@@ ures , however , say customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people at which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth problem . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two most recent days of radi@@ iti@@ zation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer clearly says that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you can call n@@ ai@@ v &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a residual risk could , and if they cannot exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the ass@@ ass@@ als will bring it completely in the call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so must the main and volunteer have to hold on site and in the region according to activities .
in the background , they always have in the background that soon a new stores could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer this question .
in fact , it is un@@ fair to place hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we would like to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has to be utilized , to in@@ corporate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no easy answers .
chim@@ ney : crimin@@ als with helicopter
the police helicopter flew over an hour in different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are for@@ mid@@ able on Friday morning at 9 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two , and struck the in@@ hol@@ d@@ de to flee .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ cul@@ ated , carrying both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis .
they fled towards the city centre .
the police pursued several stri@@ kers and a police helicopter .
the f@@ ences went without success .
perhaps the unknown in fact fell near to the apartment or at their flight .
