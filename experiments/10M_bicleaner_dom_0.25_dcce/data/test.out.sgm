<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unone, however, are the two US-presidential candidates for tax and energy policy as well as in a basic query.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to regulate the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the other hand, he would be quite different, claims by Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will regenerate regulators massively, and it makes itself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton speaks against it: the state has set certain tasks to open, he has discrimination of discrimination and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich are increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost worms.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are rejected by the state-ritual Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, even parteiinternal discussions could be held on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal transport in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, oil extraction is to be possible in far protected areas, to terminate the climate protection agreement in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment program, and demands: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only on the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpifish trading agreement, they both want to sign them.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate from international trade - but just to protect American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They then ought to be paid even better, for example Clinton calls.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hungry wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What does he want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the months preceding the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics remain before him, so the budgetary deficit would remain even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called their union to authorize new jobs in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "Alliance of Outside"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give himself the hands and to proclaim an official end of eight months of war the words and economic sanctions." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in gilded Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in Reception, I can't suggest that Ankara wants to revive these reconciliation in most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the strike, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrower and he shined heat, even for its long-term circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "" "" Putin - according to a report every five times. "" "</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that the relationship with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard that it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the Russian Government of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the shooting of a Russian fight at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from reaction to time was walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin he said, and accused Ankara, to have fallen into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The sale was even bigger, since it was celebrated by an official friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The vase is difficult to build up, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a strong, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, the Turks seemed to bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the serious case, the allegations of conductive officials had benefited from the illegal oil trading in the regions of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was therefore only taking place because Putin received the apologies from the President of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan run on first line all friends that he can get, after having failed last month in a coup d'état of nearly his amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="28">Again, terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring multiple million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia the tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count to the Mediterranean Sea of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the estimated state-television set up fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there are long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, since its reaction to the attempted coup would be regarded as weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued groll on the snow-empibility of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pivotal on it is to go out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship to Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian government in Ankara won a bonus for ensuring that it requested a coup d "état support for the elected State organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow, a self-understanding that himself has a profound fear of the regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea gave it Russia and Turkey, one how it described me a analyst, "alliance of external side-makers," two countries that are cast off from the west and is poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently admitted the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both Presidents were announced at the press conference, that they would not even underscore the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey failed to answer a question concerning their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize these differences.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO's Member States cut off the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least again.</seg>

<seg id="4">Ross McEwan distributed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected with the global ambitions of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then, the Bank has been distressed, when she had almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, brand awareness "RBS" have used to protect other end consumers.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of pound at Sponsoring, six Nations Rugby until the Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to move up more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters, and its stock network are to be changed to Natalia.</seg>

<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB is being employed at our Investors brand and the brand, under which our employees will be employed, since we are now going to become a bank of stamps."</seg>

<seg id="7">The three-month winner Dettori who before won in Ghayyar said: "it is something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional because my family is also here</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy about it that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it is not Royal Ascot - it is a banker Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am easier and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the Jubel to win the victory when he takes on Predilection</seg>

<seg id="14">Harvest piglet stand, the nine former Derbysieger had 4,493 Carrier-goat</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modern times and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is its tactic intellect, which differs him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastic fans already for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said to Frankie with a few weeks ago at Epsom, that he had already brought 6,000 winnings, if he was not just a weekend and big turnijockey man!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already almost 30 years winner of the winner, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that it is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the image of the UK flat since two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole number of big turkey win, including his famous "glorious Seven" in Ascot, but he survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he had worked with the beginning of trouble when he returned from his six months of lock, but he showed an impressive strength to beat his two-flutes and to return to its best.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he is not a long time at the end - Dettori once said that he wants to move at competitions up to a minimum of 50.ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin-fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a part of Putin's close contact with Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special authorization for environmental and transportation business.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin that Putin is ordered without indication of reasons" "" "the release Ivanovs ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who joined Ivanovs substitute since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the name of the Kremlin (in Russian) it was later that he later was later protocol and leader of the governing government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of head and checks to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov therefore asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are they convinced of the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "this step has made Moscow mysterious." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest associate of Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin that was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff arrives at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the saving of the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially in front of the legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that one man, who once praised as potential President, would like to lead to the Russian environmental policy once more - overthrew the Russian environmental policy.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked for you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could nearly say - complained for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the National Security Service of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the Chairman of the Bundessianic Service (FSB), the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">As Putin took to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people to whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could be president of Russia's second term, as a third term coup could act against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, near allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before returning to the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The project is £1.35 bn project to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown completed a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to pass from the country on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensland Crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering art by a truly epic level of this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for that part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the outlet between the viaduct and the bridge-deck is a heated activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks at their place and the last section of the decks will now be available in Rosyth a betongated for the Deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted at its place.</seg>

<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern state bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very heated activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled out at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "the SPD and Greens" "" "the SPD and Green: investors have to be much stronger in future." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "action concept" on the next countable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who is to build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD parliamentary Group Christoph Bratmann think: "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas in the future, 20 percent of all apartments have to show as social dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the inexpensive apartments can also be created in its inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "the great dispute in the town hall is, however, Bratmann:" "" "how is you going to build on private surfaces?" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to reduce investors on such grounds at least 10 percent, but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social dwellings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing feed program, which will cost millions of costs and must be financed, is intended to incentize for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there are currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors a few regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still has hardness issues for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of what, Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The action plan is implemented, which will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get medical forces.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program is not completely entirely due: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you like to compensate the loss of further 1300 favourable apartments whose support is going to run in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about to get back home again into the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one stroke, the problem would solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city run the end of the year at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be found there back to the price connection for convenient homes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the number of social apartments in the western city is drastically increased again, it is determined by the aim of the so-called thoroughblend.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens anticipate that there will be another movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child must not go out to the outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens, was accused in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen at the screen was initially limited to TV, then on video games and last to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hence it's great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I speak of course to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is created on the characters, which were initially created for videogames in the 1990s (subsequently a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-Offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of populations sank the interest in front of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">Shortly after the player go out with their smartphones to the outside and search for Pokémons, who were traced with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post ahead with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who play Pokémon Go - only the raw data for performance increase.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public appearance campaigns to health, people want to get to be "30 minutes time to come" from the sofa, "and" every day actively to be active "beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to get infected with cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful on Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people have close new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mürric gamblers that must always be difficult to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps had previously managed to follow our activity previously, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose its appeal and the use will be retreated with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons success, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and to help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I am under the women's Olympic Games in the Tower, and that from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been in the summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three Turnerves, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, which inspired for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>

<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has established the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turnerves a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but mastery gymac routines provided.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexuals of America who won with an individual surplus event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but we didn't see turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympics will only have four turers in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns will be an expensive sport and Turner first line in private turnaround that will be exciting for the training, training, travel, travel, competition, competition, and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, Turner receive all their training and this is a devote and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Bilit, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes, since then they started with the turns.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to innumerable the municipalities of Aun, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a high-performance and light-accessible turnouts.</seg>

<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler undernourished his immune system and worshiflex of a serious testing by taking some of the most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Moderator and Traautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk sawed his course to a euro note, a gelding at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwaher of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of each object he used a Luminometer to show and show us what he will get in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment described under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was a few surprising results of daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaning the bone button in a draw toilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely flushing, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen machine.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the funding of intestinal bacteria, as well as its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he leaded, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his performer, as he went through the world and ate as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations up to the rinsing of toilets, the task was the immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns, and I have all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was charged with his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proliferation showed a Luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometrib is freshly cooked hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to take away after their Luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly baked hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes to the worst thing I have used in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch here, because it is inside the inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company pays Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validate Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explained the benefits of probiotic.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy Brainstormings, which thus ended, we said "Lass to call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest of gut health is to a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of gut health and how they are associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me say so - I could have lost my respect for Ian, if he wanted to have some of the things I have instructed him, like the eceleed Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things where it was easier to bring Ian to lead them, and others in which it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of Valio survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents found Milortic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="9">There are many things to take into account since this property is probably considered as a beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment for the time and the police reported that the terror that had added the family had to raise road struggles with basins, drug abuse, drug trafficking, drugs, and floods.</seg>

<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the covered side of the congregation, garbage and old toys were thrown down.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a disgrace that the tenant adopt, any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, because a delogation is always the last step, the Cornwall Housing is considered." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">It was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their works had to be awful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I guess about the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community, who were addressed to us and have made us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that these developments will be donate to some neighbors, and the message conveys that antisoziales behavior will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons were living at different times in the house, but they all have more than 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress was put in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of house management are now to weave the landmountains, which surround the house</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals received nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">They have understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 - the country code will not be held directly at the end of summer holidays, the heavy Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as until now it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and country-swelling combat - the bite.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, which are to be convinced by the candidates, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers that are in the countryside, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so may not choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, practical problems arrive: in the holidays, helper's posters hang up, flyers, flyers and at the end of the vote, can only be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last week day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to go for a time to vote against the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in polls clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains the end of the most ambitious augmented style.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years old and since 2008, head of government, making an almost unobtrusive election campaign, looks from its large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, distributed roses and plotted a little with the people, as it did the legendary Harald Ringstorff's predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, pastering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your refugee policy, her "We are creating this" I have accelerated the rise of splashing lists, which will probably cost him a nice position.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top-class data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier has experienced how it is, if one make the wrong time on the right place campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has served twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally; Merkel is the Bundestag in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "accused Vincent cocoert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But nobody can hear anyone from the other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel must listen.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North East CDU renounces largely on the usual electrolls at market spaces and before shopping malls with sun umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, so cocades, plays only a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">Also the Union has noted that you encaped the base on the country that it must be very severe, to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely there, in the times of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU-electoral struggle with Kokert to his fellow wife is also self-devotal:" "" "they must go where there are people, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game is, Sellering gave his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Small Party with seven percent in the polls, is likely to create the leap into the country day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday, a modern virtualization and lay their campaign against the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" is called the Chairman of the Council of Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green ballots go on track search for native abstains amongst the tourists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidist, curvt straight with a houseboat through the mecclenburgian lakes and it is also beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="24">Manches also works unbalanced and can be open questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of Gedulled to the example - is the question: what does that actually do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were there.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people concerned about the high number of refugees to worry about the security.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite the Dieselandals the delivery figures rise in the world.</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts from deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">In spite of its many brands and some well-operating markets, Europe's largest bus station can continue to increase the market thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Deliveries in the home market Germany had spread their deliveries by almost a sixth hour.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand leader Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers from July primarily to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, in some core markets, we have granted a purchase agreement in some core markets.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote of the withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust affaires first esaw, there is also a minus beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the mainly concerned house-brand of Lower Saxony has remained in further glimping by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition request from 0.9 per cent to 3,37 million vehicles are beech.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group Chief of Staff Fred Kappler continued to split a sales from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen has provided 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated the software with a software application.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls some 2.5 million cars to rearmament in the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament, VW, that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After rearmament the vehicles, it is no deterioration with fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the car of the bus to the rearmament is" "" "guaranteed" "" "certificate, but does not speak of a" "" "guarantee" "", "as stated on Friday in business trips." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "the" Focus "" "" "Focus," "", "Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for all diesel models." ""</seg>

<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that, on fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power after rearmament no deteriorations will be held and all typing relevant vehicles remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was in corporate travel.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the long term "guarantee" we see the possibility that customers will come to a factory for half a year after rearmament within a factory - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also important to avoid that it is important to do in any other damage caused by waids to do anything with the gassation scandal, as it was called.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men aged middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to the commentary part, in order to oversee him under the pseudonym UnAlleensamic Age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the resurrection of sound boards is not present on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the redness of physical objects, but due to the Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have purchased a record recently, are all previews to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional importance: older plate staff retain their feelings for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone spending time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I run in a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and getting wild, before I stand, let my hands hold and something best thing as: "so, let's throw a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slow to its charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera for the next part, where I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men, middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess" I guess "he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not have followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has an important number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy boards that he could not afford, when they appeared and re-buy items that he sold when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared as I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a little boy to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy disks are rather introverted, and gladly spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believe that many customers that he meets at the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and get back to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people are generally accepted as of 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves again their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of a specific age at a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of boards?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds to get into a shop like Phonica, in order to recognize that record shops provides a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers took a violation of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some of the record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to pull down the stability of familiar brists, from objects to watch the happier youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes, it can be the colt of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social worker!" "" "a staff of a record stack of stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A poll of the ICM revealed that almost 50% of people who have bought a record from the last month they haven't listened.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found that 41% have a turntables that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while using a stack of Bossa Nova Computations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noted a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently came here and said," "" "I have no turntable, but I would like to buy a radio record top so that I can set it into the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it certainly happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musiclaves.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no turntables." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who come only slowly.</seg>

<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores, the Wild Beasts of the New Synthesizer- and right-wing Pop instead of Experimental Jazz goes from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversities in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychic traumata are hard to be able, if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been around for a few minutes in business and consider the Varietals of the boards available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a manger bumble than a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, therefore the collection of panels does not have real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from one computer or to other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a dedly sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have been inspired by a new generation of record lovers: urban Outjam.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the note to courier the jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teammers who grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can look at them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of what any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to be chargeable.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my reresearch results showed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in disc-shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record owners who exist in reality, turnouts and in onlinecontinue.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">You don't spend their Thursday morning with security, with the mountain shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves through boards, while it meier the necked gaze of an unsecret, 30-year-old lying Moderator who protrued nothing from the shoulders above the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a trial negotiating this week, the authorities argued that the state should be able to sell 72 temporary businesses within the camp, from cigarettes to Energyz, sell hairdressings or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would have accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there should be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary shops, but it seems that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are absolutely unretractable. "</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-seater Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday night at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten up with a result of 43-7 in the Dealer Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji, a master class in the handling, side-stepping, descendary, line run and rowers to win gold - their first Olympic amedaille every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed because of the not very bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of that, a 15-man team in the form of this form would have been struck.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB, but it will probably not think that at least a gold medal around his neck will have hanging around his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, former Chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult track behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost their game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap is wehed, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head began to be silent and left the attacks GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the Kapitän Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau walked over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly tapped the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hectic trolley of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it's only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute you can catch a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-pfiff and there was still a minute game play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prefake through any weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion carried a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so, when you were born to play the 7, while GB still remains daimated.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is that way.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliants run of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt on GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea, whose fans cheered and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i bag pointed out with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The soff beet, the Fijis encircled and in the bloodd were defeated in the lawn.</seg>

<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton Cook passed the line with an impressive footsteps and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-body teams, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning through the fight with the cancer of the trainer as a rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more engine gold than those games, and that wants to be called what.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder until the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it were only those who were sitting at the ruin, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was allotted to the second Olympiagold in the branch without tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of the British Sports, which laid a scale in such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all of her 39.ter uninterrupted use, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that glides on the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not reflected the nature of the tribunny.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the Rudern, a battalion consented to helpers which make the difference, and there was no man more helpful than the coach that would not survive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had a bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, he spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is changing a little view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which held the interruption for a minimum, if that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran at around 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">It begins that way.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing itself is a challenge, but this makes it even larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who used to spend some more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a centurion in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much that this means, how much I and Helen and also worked with Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could have no better person for a trainee or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Stver and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we simply wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take time for one year before making decisions on its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure means.</seg>

<seg id="6">Because Singen is like a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular assembly, seniors can link social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures often solve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize ourselves to the others, and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of merits." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For there they exercise a profound and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who calls his lungs are not so fast in everyday life as fast as the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it's about to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, "Ursula Lenz says from the German labour community of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint Singen had a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in the spare time, it explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or hearing from songs to older people raised many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to song textured and particularly melodies, people are depressed by themselves for long-term events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the head requires a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to focus on its own voice and to focus on a given rhythm, and to adapt to other singers, this is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not only practice themselves to concentrate on itself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you race through the singing of singing in the choir is Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through the singing of singing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even to show: if I'm getting a bit for something, I will feel better and awake over me - this experience becomes stronger.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to test a new hobby should not hesitate - even if it means to have little talent, says Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">One does not sing alone - at 50 sing people, who hears there, if once a tone is next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors different ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the acquaintance in an old parenchyma, one can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens are also found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours with the help of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing is necessarily to join a choir, avenged Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing soul is good and has something liberating - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed insights while the investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway through the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Advisory Committee released their own findings with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom created a superbly limited process for the creation of renovations on Isil and Iraqi security services," a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, so Mr. Ship," "" "delayed the publication of the news service reports" "", "the morals under Analyst and" "" "delivered little space for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence to have found any references to the White House at CentCom analyst with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">In August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon to the Pentagon master, which were recorded according to complaints by CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pressesprecher of the Pentagon, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspectorate is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite discounted opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have agreed on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year, however, have had the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command Program of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critique concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remembered the disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a written piece about how the then government under George W. Bush had seen a little of occupying troops in Iraq and had little time on the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team of Mr. Hooker reports that contrary to government officials, no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the Blackmarket.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this finding was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaging commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislatures due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie gave also the first two gates for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but bam (27) said she could not remember that ever had ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this is what they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are simultaneously defeated in their group with the British on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide who will take part in the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed board gets a little longer from the path that will lead to the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising host of their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a Hockeyracket in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player from the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, since they could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came in 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the jobs in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have able to catch the rugs completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a retreat from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament went into the game, but the team showed itself surprising and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>

<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the porters of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, just as late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and insoftwist, a rapid relay change between competition and battle.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, who is rescued from the wrists to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbours in the queue, without having Simone Biles, Katie Leading y or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could certainly have been sent among these well-known names, built by sponsors and well-made TV advertising when it would be a swimmers, Turner or even feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not avers any event any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I'm a modest arguments for my particular lovers, then leave me attention to the discreet charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the tramp-jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so many that I asked, didn't know that it is an Olympiasportart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignorms.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to contest, there has never been a medal at trampolinjumping competition and had a athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to be the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians share the ones for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong in China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolinjump has a certain outer scale, partly because it sounds suitable for the uninterrupted ear of a clownsess than the suitable for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bloom enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristical potential - the cartoonous citrus of his never too end - but also the grazie of turnaround and dew that combines two sports, which is essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" is located by the Spanish El Trampoline, which means that much means a "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling motions (turning, limbs and saluttos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are evaluated according to official Olympics aprograms according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-lasting athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in the Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the target, sometimes and back, up and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only drive the line line or the output wall, but in the TV transfer there is another insight: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streaks is nobel, admired, even fanatiated, and it's enough to touch even a viewer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's what I think even when looking at this games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolinspringers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A backward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she speckled, seemingly heaviest as an astronaut, go to the top, then go down again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, not vault into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant revocation of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, likewise at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the duck as part of a afternoon block of two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably overlook the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the magnitude of consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the objective of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Dooley expects his home to air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters that demand political changes in Ethiopia pushed on violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protests were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the past ten years, one of the most stable countries of Africa was one of the most stable countries of Africa and a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and far more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and desired fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot and killed on fire unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show such as security of young people with shocks, while these were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for Human Rights requires a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will be even more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians, to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had everything else as a model for democracy, human rights organisations have continued the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents have been effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or put into prison, killing or put into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and don't have other options, apart from" "" "said Seyoum Thome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the soil usage to the worms with regard to power of the regent coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a significantly critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zackened, disputed line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analytics fears that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced more or less forced to arm the turmoil and arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitter stamping after years of age is now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years there were very many Ethiopians in the position to communicate with the social media, since cheap smartphones were always more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about the internet proxies that conceal where they hold themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave their way to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnias in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Ethiopia the Amharah, who come from eopia mainly to Christian high countries, in the politics and the economy, while they took off the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and in shallow regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the tiray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, in the trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is death from Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Until his death in 2012, Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopians in the year 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactic genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially sealed in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special authorization to edit enemies and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing to this basic program," "" "Mr. Abdi said, a conflict analytics." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Cush's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively untransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region north of Ethiopians, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analytics say that he is not enjoying the confidence of the baray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested by the government, seemingly confirmed by the government and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many Protestants were killed, even if there were fewer than in the last months and this time of unrest was relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not have the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in gondar, an amharical city, of Tigray run shops and the hatred toward the Tigray is becoming increasingly common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests are the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if it has recently distributed that it closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West definitely wants to support democracy, he doesn't want that his ally breakup in an already volatile neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin catwalk."</seg>

<seg id="7">As opposed to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the excuse seriously.</seg>

<seg id="14">In late July, he moved strong criticism when he said that Russians should hacking Mrs. Clintons Emails, however he explained later "Natzweiler."</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defending the sound for the Presidential elections, Mr. Trump has yet accepted a lot of their sound because its envelopes have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head-head in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he accused his critics frequently to suspend his statements or to understand his humour.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>

<seg id="8">Only when it comes up, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a total of 2.6 km / h - and is as fast as a Robbe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "this time of loneliness, the lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on the journal Science "in any of a Greenland which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," said Alexander Schaelein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist thought that Greenland will be rocky.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to observe, after all, they live primarily in the ice Sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around 6 degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time pulls, as they rent six animals in front of Svalbard, six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks like this: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe; another had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young icorn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice Sea and are looking for cadre, which are from higher water layers down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland which took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard, at the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the largest 502 centimeter measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, it analyzed the linolines of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens has already been produced before the birth of the sharks which contained in it later is no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had much carbon-14 in the liner core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore be in the early 1960s when nuclear weapons try to sluggish large amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their linens, there were normal carbon-14 levels in their linens, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-watch showed a 493-centimetre-long Greenland age of 335, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters will be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenland-females only get offspring if they are more than four meters, it was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could be assigned an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be at the threshold for sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland with the overflow obviously requires at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live above all in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, put under his cheque on the neck a 120 year old harpoon pointed, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism is often run on asfles living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">They attack later - and slowest slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface, using the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as soon as possible as many descendants" "", "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game since the system operators will terminate the energy contract and thus complete all delivery contracts, as the supplier of the supplier is shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to be commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout for 20 years is set out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of ALCOA in Portland are located on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk at risk.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Dominoeffects because the melting y consumes around 10 percent of the total generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, ALCOA completed the Point Henry melt, which led the last year to a closing of the Anglesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt-down of ALCOA in Portland loses money and risked a clamping force.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long speculations concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which is the big aluminium melon with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, distributed that there will be three other owners to terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority owned by ALCOA and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL comes from that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting y means," divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL still said that the contracts so-called "backup transactions are to be in force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence AGL assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the income," said the electricity supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL from the GJ 18 are limited by the prognoses of strong appointment markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with the value of treaties already in its annual withdrawal of $187 million in "anticipation of a notice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "ALCOA said that the decision to book the contracts," "" "ability Alcoas... the melt or the power supply to the melt-down" "" "does not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have been entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a statement, why it has been withdrawn from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="9">The September edition is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles a picture tape as a fashion magazine, the edition draws a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista were 832 pages of the market (615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his Coverstars is expected to see the fact that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still drowned before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover, Naomi Campbell, Linda evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even during the small chance that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "passage of its generation" - under the previous category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">This celebrity times are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today to know how to twisted a good Snapchat video (even if everything is tightened to jets).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women to mark themselves in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover appeared with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners would not like to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleagues in Gigi Hadid and she called "the mistress of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings sounds too high, when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the failure to recover seems to pass at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is in the truest sense of the word a super model.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your Grundation of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">They sold from her made pictures of Cindy Crawfords daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is to be seen in the reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in Time Period: the Nokia Communicator has arrived on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and much, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty quicker.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at the beginning of eight Megabytes, which would now be enough for about two tablets with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with a minimum of 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the business - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros you can buy the devices on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced a couple of months earlier at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hannover as an "office in the Westentaschenformat."</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent a lot: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, also by fax it was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible by HTML browser, even if it is slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded as a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could see in August 1996 that the Communicator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile pfone of the Finns had an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market dominate the market today, who came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Wherever you are online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for itself alone 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">To do this, the well-ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company are coming.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the meantime, around the smartphone is now an entire industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough for the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007, at that time the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhones.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a internet communication, everything is easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple began the triumphal train of Apple, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry who ruled the market had to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="35">It finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Sagen is now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a self-prudent for 20 years after his invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, every German player is looking at 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in witty growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in all UK.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third running step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datalogy: so perfide repressing hacker its ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer from compressive malware access currently targeted companies - and are succeeding in doing so successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware air defence specialist Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once at least once, partly several victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been aiming at ransomatic goods.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims are willing to readily receive the funds required by the Daily Money, in order to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of the artist, the perpetrators are specialized on attacks on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential-to-press release is considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently a frightening fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most painters were still able to send advertising to advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator discovered the express software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it is looking for a long-long modified files such as WordPress, Excel- or database files, as well as to archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the receivables of the Erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, the victim must be money - mostly in the form of Crypating bitcoin - skip.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where personal use is the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies with sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production stands still closed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls below, if a Ransomware strike.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt the business activities, with a case people were in danger of danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, that only the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the company.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this, and try to build a good report.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researcher of F-Secure have examined the user surface areas and contact with the presses and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims of chat as they can pay with bitcoin, inaccessible support websites, or decrypt freely for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed by a few hundred euros, companies will have to pay hard negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data without turnkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk winnings from the Ransomware supply, hacker are always professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski of the Antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware approximately within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software tool to the real erpresser.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware-kits were created by Malware himself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "scope of delivery is a customization tool that can be changed to smaller configurations, appearance and branding," says Wisniewski. "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are looking for further hacker to distribute the newly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums in the underground, you buy the set of a crime and asked for another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is carried out per inert calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals carry out spinning with the spread," explains Wisniewski "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the risk of Ransomware is known to many companies that keep their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies-IT facilities in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware may be able to withdraw using a file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful vomiting alone, the perpetrators" "" "explains the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations" "", "explains Malwarebra boss Marcin Kleczynski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the potential of damage depending on the type of data is more multiple than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators of the future could take completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, how they could get a thermostat under the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the application of a derart-block heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware may also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday-proof</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to pack everything in the little HR V: a little SUV, a little Coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overload, but the HR V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although it is only 1,60 m high HR-V rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in a lot of space, it works closely on no spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inside area are well-processed and can work pleasant, only the cockpit of the cockpit falls there something.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a caffeine room of 453 l at high-provided and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded as kinosessel and thus offer storage space that is about 1.24 m high from the floor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space is well loaded, but the loading height with a height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-l Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp will accelerate the HR-V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work is likely to judge a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gratifying is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive will not be offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering might be a bit direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" does not require any need to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system is part of the state-emergency braking system (working until Tempo 32), the collisions system and the trace systems.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sometimes, the collisions warmed up, sometimes, because he has evaluated many obstacles as "heredging objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable, the TV assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And intelligent tempo regulators responds to the traffic detection and throttle the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are lying under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest in so much, the gasoline engine will receive €20,000, the diesel from €23000.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, there are hours for hours, at night there is a long time in the morning, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one comes with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten percent are often feeling of sleep or permanently and not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep problems, and there may be various reasons based, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeeze, member of the German Society for Sufforation and Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the Insomnie, so an entry and a sleepy disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, many people can sleep well as unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Haussmann association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel says.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep problems are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Beyond that, organic, psychological or galvanized factors, but also plugging drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early-waking, especially with a depression frequently," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are interconnected to each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc can really lie, awakes all two to three hours and starts to blurge on all day problems and make sure that there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is not possible anymore.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one work with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If anyone does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights per week and on the day, he should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look different. it is undefeated, tired, unfolding, has difficulty with the attention and the concentration, is easily charming, has voting rights or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve bedinterference, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medications - classical sleeping tablets only in the exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly documented sleep in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fixer, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should now turn to sleep problems at bedbugs, avenged Weeeze.</seg>
<seg id="24">The one can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in sleep laboratory, physician, for example, at snoring with respiratory irritation, in case of pathogenic dayability, or if you don't find the cause of a sleepy disturbing, explained spruce.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not need to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a lunch break," "" "says Fibers." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wiring, one goes to the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body you have a nostrates, a chest strap and a feeller on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, a camera draws to the ceiling on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a number of shafts, where you can attach to a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whites counts on: regular bedtime and rise time, not too long in bed, not to sleep on the day, don't watch television to sleep, alcohol depart, and at night not at the clock - then you start to expect, and that's all and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers moved under the jewish of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street acts peaceful: parents go with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain to the late end.</seg>
<seg id="12">Very close to the skin projects are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who are here three children, are mainly attributable to the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the care of rising and genetic engineering with the inhabitants of the skin projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not according to a pantz who wanted to hinder majority polishing in front of vandalous Left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innuenator and the police are going up between home and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working area, which today also has a lower average temperature and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also Haussmann and the resulting living projects are already long to the Kiev: in 1990 numerous houses in the former East Germany were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared among the large police battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still occupied by people still occupied by people, which they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years became increasingly popular for tourists and election liner from all over the world: with them now residents of the GDR-times and former house occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also is noticeable in the rent, which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaers are being attacked as symbols for these developments: they detects them into the cut discs or freshly painted facades which were shot with colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for this, that not all neighbours must consider this as a problem, that they are not to be affected by criminality: offenders, such as body violability, according to statistics, according to statistics.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make changes of damage that tends to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, there is no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">If violence is concerned, it is most important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been this.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars also give it no longer in the Rigaer longer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for this architect, her street is not a criminal firing, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from each other, as elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigs Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important that local residents receive their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly stressed the Deutch shoots over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by the face of newbuildings in former building gaps that push the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are the original apartments that are not interesting for many people - here are more people living here, which are not so good," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I can absolutely not have gutheirs."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do, if never heareth any man?</seg>
<seg id="36">Then on all sides frustration is present, also by the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For accessibility that likes to paint over paint bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of it - just like someone who passes into a pub area, can be perceived through noise on noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All only presented with prenames were asked to be called, not to be called by their real name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee contractor</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact associations in the case of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, she is a social worker at the site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee contractor for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical supports the management of the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group for refugees, administration, authorities, and who else are mixes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client of the working group indicates that Deuschle is more thankful that Deuschle is now there, the jealousy, who has a problem in particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spinning than much attention to the multitude of problems would be targeted - meant when the administration wanted to write the site.</seg>
<seg id="9">We searched for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people, associated with a longtime experience in the field of social work, just a jealousy pleasesau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is an organization, work with the people in front of the site and also behind the scenes as well as grid activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It took a 50-percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine Client, that Annika Deuschle honours and main actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be located at the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A grave problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the connecting ploughs that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">In charge of the connection, the municipalities are in charge.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must fit the refugees in your own or rented residential area.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or renovation of these properties must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the land council with the Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto you find no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It did not function so far so that one has dependent on private apartments, then Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community homes have to be renewed, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will soon be installed in the basin.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, there are interiors, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and compensation activities for refugees and migrants who need to be set up or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemaster, complete nonprofit work - and motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">It does not mean work, but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a strong structure, say Deuschle and client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would need to develop an impecent feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and mainly language course.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So I jump administration and volunteer here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centralised that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it will take it, and it can make the period sensible, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who sometimes cannot help the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, but may not work and be unprofitable, who will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem failures, however, say customer honestly, "people at which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and client is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a "mammoth problem."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two most recent days of radiitization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer clearly says that" "" "what you can call naiv" "". "a residual risk could, and if they cannot exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They had the fear that the assassals will bring it completely in the call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So must the main and volunteer have to hold on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they always have in the background that soon a new stores could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to place helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach, where we would like to go," "" "said Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes it clear that the Urbacher has to be utilized, to incorporate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.</seg>
