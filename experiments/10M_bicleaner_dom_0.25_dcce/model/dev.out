Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
they both wanted to speak on the realization of the international agreement as well as over Teheran to dest@@ abil@@ is@@ ili@@ ating measures in the Middle East .
however , in the meeting it should also discuss the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the ratio between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is criti@@ ci@@ zed the first settlement of the Israeli Republic of Israel , and has a lack of peace in the peace process .
the Iranian nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed by the Obama &apos;s Iranian nuclear programme .
in March , Netanyahu , on invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , had kept a controversial discussion that was likely to count as a colle@@ ron@@ t against Obama .
the speech did not talk with Obama , a meeting had denied this connection to the previous election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend admitted to
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb , with a little z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and would have to come to his house .
later Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably be excited and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , officials found the car@@ case of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to cancel it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who had ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no reference to Lamb who had traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , in order to have traveled 300 miles to the school premises where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular former professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University of Police Director Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that Lamb made the ver@@ ging emergency after it sometime .
until the end of the day , there was also another death : he took life when the police bo@@ ils him .
one day after shooting in the university , the university students and do@@ z@@ ants forced him to hide and hide from the doors , the authorities are still trying to reveal a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details known by the intermedi@@ aries in both ends of the state published details , as well as what the students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but probably difficult teachers .
students said they were glad to play on his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ish@@ iss died , said he did not have the history of violence or a criminal court .
shi@@ ver himself mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he divided his academic life .
both students worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose apprentices include 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some til@@ ings to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
a student at Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , the Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , told that the Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
besides , Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and we were told to have something for any health problem .
in this year he lec@@ tured on only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university shows that the Promotion , which was so hard for the Lamb , would not have a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing from a conflict between God and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Intro@@ duction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is asking questions , the Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he arrives back in Mississippi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , someone killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran even in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to that house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university , which gave some 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , and established ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received a doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends in Lam@@ bs acknowledged him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said , it was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar in some years .
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
all girls have f@@ melted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and P@@ eas@@ ants were obviously a couple of time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no deed from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , gr@@ asp@@ ed to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the Police said that the dog was in order .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he never met Me , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met three years ago both on a summer anniversary .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes maintenance coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Rooms , a weak illuminated bar near by G@@ auti@@ er , said that he finished his guitar and mouth harp when he finished his guitar and mouth harp when he came to an in@@ arian audience .
there were no evidence for anything that was un@@ approved .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clean rooms and j@@ ute .
I mean they had both a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , has led the first semester program and specialized in American ab@@ orig@@ ines and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , a English @-@ professor at school .
he was married with three small children .
he studied at the State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student @-@ Committee .
at the Delta State campus in Cleveland , about 900 people attended the campus in Cleveland , including do@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light event .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Memorial , while the University of B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
classes are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Sol@@ is reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police bul@@ ge , after he had shot David , and that Lamb didn &apos;t compl@@ ain when his wife called Pra@@ ent@@ iss , but there was no indication that the two had ever been married .

Michael J. Fox after his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a large moment on Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the roy@@ als , and I consider that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it will come to me in mind that I &apos;m a sim@@ ulated G@@ äh@@ de and an arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales at a Date .
&quot; Back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; Back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time @-@ travel movie that has ever turned over . &quot;
&quot; Back in Time &quot; will be shown on V@@ OD , DVD , and selected movie theaters in October .
UN Head@@ phones says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said his answer to Russia &apos;s ampli@@ fied military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for nearly five years of conflict , and more weapons will be reli@@ ed on violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN Bureau is demanding once again all parties , including the UN Security Council , decided to unite and integ@@ rative negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meeting the Foreign Secretary of the five permanent member states of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he was sorry that the escal@@ ates in the Council and the Regional Council and the Regional powers can make &quot; this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
in order of course , Ban called for the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they demonstrated on the achievement of a nuclear de@@ position with Iran .
8 Quest@@ ions that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
however , no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump of the upper gears to the bottom , it hasn &apos;t work yet .
ten of the last 11 national pol@@ ls conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in double digits , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nomin@@ ation of real estate .
of course it &apos;s still too early in the electoral term .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys won his leadership at the rising execution of Herman Cain , of which none of them won a nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he would never fight in a general election .
but external circuits such as Je@@ b Bus@@ sy Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps through stam@@ ina and start to run their dollar , to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current circumstances that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump has announced its can@@ did@@ ature in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
by the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have seen a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; offended , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent said they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters think they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; disp@@ leased &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans will not see any of the w@@ ren@@ al temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ ber and ins@@ ul@@ ising statements , 52 percent of the elec@@ tor@@ n@@ ating Irish voters think that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l will have the right temper@@ ament for president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first pre@@ respective state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he spoke the personality to a commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he &apos;s not the personality to execute effectively his ministry , and nearly six out of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament is not in the white house , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump in real .
if they are asked , who is likely to win the GO@@ P @-@ nomin@@ ation , say after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten of July got their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans revealed that Rick Per@@ ry win the nomin@@ ation compared to just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a wide variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will watch Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as pl@@ au@@ c@@ els .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gather themselves together in another candidate , Tr@@ ump still suggests each other .
some experts believe that the frag@@ ile field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread on more than a dozen other candidates .
but a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump the majority of the majority .
he lives ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of the margin of Paul , John Ka@@ herself and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would move the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a small majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fan states that they have made their minds .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters that support tr@@ ump will be saying that they have forgiven their voices .
of course , it can take a lot to change that , and nobody can tell you , never to change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their opinion , are twice as frequent for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on the topic of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape crisis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his campaign , two months ago , the immigration and fishing spot went to the public dis@@ course in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are wor@@ ried that the result of a tr@@ ump threshold of tr@@ ump @-@ Americans will be far away from the Republi@@ can Party and damaged the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ s are able to agree with tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
as long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently has to do .
the fru@@ stration on the government is climbing on new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben car@@ son meanwhile fell by half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider Status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans speak in the new mon@@ day survey by ABC / Post ; they prefer to use a political foreign language as someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious to Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; matches . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ way , there is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea basin .
in the street , a square meters of a cage room is 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer is limited to objects in nature &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations will cost a square meter of most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student residence in Munich not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top residential comple@@ xes , one of the prices will come as un@@ uts .
a real estate service provider Angel &amp; League has published a ranking of the most exclusive German territorial sites - with a square fine rise in enormous heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , noticed .
but good , those who can afford ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception as an exception .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream@@ start , thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double sc@@ ary sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a real hit by Thomas Müller in the FC Bayern took the way to a earned 3 : 0 on the Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it .
a sovereign event of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ ze have given the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Pir@@ us a dream start into &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twelfth stage in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the campaign potential to Munich .
Müller received a shot at the Champions League in the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ Leadership League , who made a face to the foot of the World Champion at the end of his 28th in the Champions League .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate that , with Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame promised to the game at the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich stopped word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without gl@@ itter@@ ing .
pir@@ ate had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them a renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) moved to Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , the Bayern was defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams that they wouldn &apos;t want the next sacrifice .
they went to work cour@@ age@@ ously , but in her open efforts however often too in@@ experienced .
attacks were initiated too often by playing business on line outside Douglas Costa , that had rarely passed on the earlier Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i by the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made a bit of luck than his flan@@ k from the right @-@ leg of the left side of the to@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in just half of them had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when an Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown proposed the pol@@ o of Poland from the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct withdrawal to the go@@ al@@ keeper of Roberto with his knees ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern In@@ ks lived its in@@ struc@@ tur@@ nal game , he could set Pi@@ raeus N@@ adel@@ ki .
but at the por@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , he was rest@@ oring .
about this , as he lear@@ ns a shot from Ide@@ ye on the lan@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before moving to Gu@@ ardi@@ ola he was to defend a 4 chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ ati@@ o , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WC @-@ hero had given the green light just after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports maker Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to do something else from this is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola also decided during the first change when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the nomin@@ ees Jo@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
the go@@ dd@@ ess came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6 ) and after 13 minutes later , there was still a clear 13 minutes later , Müller made a wind up .
before the game it was come to the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of righ@@ t@@ m@@ ated Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience blo@@ c there were apparently showing the supporters of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with sho@@ cks against the Munich trailer .
at least a Bayern fan got insured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
anyone smo@@ kes , do not harm the lung , but also the teeth - this lays a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : when w@@ ai@@ ver the risk sin@@ ks too fast .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth out early .
this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smoking stood the risk of losing their teeth mat@@ ure@@ ly in order to shed the 2.@@ 5- to 3.6 @-@ fa@@ c .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of fl@@ oss are car@@ ies and infections of the g@@ ums , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these peri@@ o@@ don@@ tit@@ is a risk factor .
the relationship between smoking and dental loss may therefore go back to frequent fl@@ um disease in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking also increased the risk of car@@ ies .
people who stopped smoking with smoking could reduce their risk of risk within a short time period by writing the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the end@@ an@@ gering again fell to the level of non @-@ smokers , first author Thomas Dietrich von der British University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people of it , no smoking , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoke the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels , but according to our insights , good quality health is up to the high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have affected by dental insom@@ nia , the DI@@ f@@ D announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous studies have already noted that smoking is the risk of early to@@ oth@@ ed out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ dens the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late anti@@ quity
the repeated time that was repeated for the first time in Cologne , archaeological discover@@ ies have been found in Cologne .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ eton and remains of historic buildings have dug up close to the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , he said to Marcus Trier , Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , histori@@ ans see the search of the so @-@ called ground monuments .
the museum has always been moved to the Department of Archae@@ ological dig Li@@ ves in Cologne for all construction projects in the Cologne district of Cologne .
in the third construction stage of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the arche@@ ologists were now found .
from text documentation , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained in Trier .
in addition to resi@@ den@@ ces of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves were found , probably belonged to the church .

on the early Wednesday morning around 1.@@ 40 the woman crossed the direction of railway station . at the end of the railway station , the track came up and was captured by a freight train from the direction of Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the capture of the train , she was borne by the Federal Police he@@ avi@@ est injuries .
it was treated as a doctor , who had taken care of emergency doctor in a hospital .
but there is no knowledge about the reason of the night crossing of the young woman .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents of acoustic perception .

the EU Commission proposes a new court in fighting over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the cont@@ ested private lighting equipment for disputes between companies and countries are expected to be replaced by a transparent system , which complies with clearly more traditional recipes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the competent EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström by the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish Supreme Court presented the talks on the European dep@@ ort@@ isation position for free talks with the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is the world &apos;s largest Free Trade Zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggest that the EU states and the United States have jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should represent equal parts of the EU , the United States and the third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to lev@@ y against def@@ endants .
so far , the trial of the trial agreed on an arbit@@ rator , a claim against their def@@ endants , did not exist .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens don &apos;t keep the old IS@@ DS system for Fair@@ ness and Justice , and thus did not trust in the issues of Fair@@ ness .
in the long term , she wants to commit to an international investment tribunal according to their own information .
in this case , the disputes between Chinese companies and EU states might be clari@@ fied there .
the fore@@ ground @-@ arbit@@ ration proceedings only ( IS@@ DS ) above all will apply as one of the main reasons for the large resistance in Europe against the TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration will be criti@@ ci@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel amb@@ ition , allowing the companies to extingu@@ ish the pay@@ ers , national legislation , or lowering the level of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments of anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ in@@ act , the Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient .
it was especially criti@@ ci@@ zed for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already worked free trade agreement .
the German Economic Under@@ secretary of Matthias Mach@@ ir ( SPD ) marked the plans on the other hand as major progress .
in the end , the Commission included key points , the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring of other EU trade ministers .

delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
in front of eleven years Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to him , a fli@@ p@@ chart is set up on which the sh@@ y , which is used by the picturesque US state of Michigan , is recorded with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens .
he tells of a number of places that he repeatedly report on the map , reports on his de@@ vol@@ ous and z@@ art arranged songs .
where they were created and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been working as a wonder@@ fully creative sense .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; the Great Lake State , &quot; appear very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always dri@@ pping at any time to the great op@@ ul@@ ent .
rum@@ ors , &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a tra@@ ded series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be in succession .
but already in 2004 and in the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and its expectations had a positive impact .
reduces Stev@@ ens up here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician again returns to the series in New York .
together with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens In@@ es You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Netherlands &quot; ) published in 2005 a widespread masterpiece .
conc@@ ord@@ ingly for ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any case by the influential music media .
after productive experiment@@ ing , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth studio album is still a lot of orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or advice and plays with all the effect and hall .
from the smaller club in the smaller summer , the stage shows for colorful spectac@@ le from Neon @-@ ends and large @-@ sto@@ cking stages .
currently planning Su@@ fi@@ jan Stev@@ ens as part of a five @-@ member band across Germany .
in a dark red Hamburg city More !
theatres he presents mainly the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although nearly 2000 guests were b@@ oured in their chairs , the more ri@@ pped Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and to folk .
without a word addressed to the public , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience one hears say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you could therefore throw away the &quot; plate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to an en@@ core would like to thank Stev@@ ens very much older songs and eventually ten@@ ds to be tos@@ sed with roaring appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut with the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has expected its debut at the prime minister &apos;s prime minister since he has chosen Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns !
the new Labour Chair Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should provide his debut with the prime minister of the Prime Minister for the first time , with David Cameron .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will arise to make the first of its six given questions briefly to noon , with which the media is likely to be reviewed by the media and the Labour M@@ EPs from close @-@ up .
he called for &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave them .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary report to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because she is named after his appointment as a member of the Ch@@ att@@ enk@@ amm barracks and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has insi@@ sted , criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S pro@@ vo@@ res and is at the centre of several titles @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention .
a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been standing in a respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he was recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air stream of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ran@@ et , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ week program , that he decided to sing the Labour Code , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party did him as leaders .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are mut@@ ually involved in the production of &quot; Labour &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements to the European Union and the limitation of winnings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are pre @-@ set to remove the whole idea of limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of working and pensions , said that the Party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clearly stated that they could only reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 at £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Party leader David Cameron , since he has headed a T@@ ory boss over the last decade of the Dis@@ patch pit in parliament .
the Labour Group , who promised another policy letter , says that he has received &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the wound of the Prime Minister is too front@@ ational and that he is subjected to both &quot; b@@ low@@ ness &quot; and the swe@@ aring with withdrawal , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of business meetings , will represent him if he does not participate , for example , when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea into the conversation , that other colleagues occasionally exhibit the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ tha , the speaker of the house , spoke to the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is dealing with politics in the style of a &quot; Casino Per@@ le &quot; Theatre , which often is associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he acknowledged that he had failed in it .
since it was broadcast@@ ed on TV in 1990 , freight rates with Prime Minister became the most important Bar@@ ometer of the decision of a leader and its position among its par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated increase in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ unds rose sharp@@ ly after the data , which showed an increase in the growth of the United Kingdom . Moreover , the F@@ T@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result was increased without bonuses in the UK by 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest in 2009 and was in@@ valuable at the time of interest auction .
the Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share of the market and made a jump from 20 % after the take@@ over offer of the rival AB In@@ stead was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine various brands such as Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and G@@ rol@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were tail@@ or @-@ made messages from the competition for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reporting growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % , after the mining tradition said that from $ 2.5 billion has taken $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its strategy of debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper gigs of Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sachs had its estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports clothes company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CEO of J@@ D Sport Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for annual UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would mean more buying force in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this purchasing power will become the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could be part of the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , which he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Just@@ in Bie@@ ber in the capital : at the Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Just@@ in Bie@@ ber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .

the type with the plat@@ oon hair is 100 million euros hard .
more even more .
at present , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns around .
like Wik@@ i Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans flash@@ ed Just@@ in yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
but at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ damer Platz .
the Bie@@ ber building : here you live I@@ do@@ l , whose posters hang on st@@ ett@@ ings in St@@ ett@@ in , since Monday evening .
the suite , where the Canadian singer is living , will cost exactly as much as their m@@ om E@@ wa in half a year .
if ever .
it says : &quot; actually , my Vik@@ toria have to sit in the tenth grade in the high school . &quot;
&quot; I will perform a dream . &quot;
school@@ ing right ?
who ju@@ ry it ?
the fans don &apos;t know .
even Bie@@ ber , not .
he is stran@@ ded anyway .
for the advertisement in the temp@@ ting of the Super@@ market , he secured three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ pi@@ ps company which attracted many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and at every doll that looks like he and over the Lad@@ der , bending also bending .
when Just@@ in Bie@@ ber drink a coffee , rest@@ oring the window disc .
more than 100 million it should be so exploited .
some people say the h@@ ype go too far .
another one , Bie@@ ber is finally right in the USA and Great Britain with its new single &quot; What do you Me@@ an ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he is doing so .
pe@@ i@@ da poster illustr@@ ate Lebanese potato @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it is both - and in the potato driver , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner , Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
inspired by the parable &quot; potato , &quot; on a poster published by the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat put together on a j@@ av@@ elin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the idea it brought him a poster with the Lev@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a gr@@ illed bac@@ kl@@ ash , which is equipped with meat and potatoes , has since been installed in his shop .
&quot; this is Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Lebanese man has meanwhile put down the Lebanese office in Munich ( Germany ) .
there , according to the authority , the authority has been protected as a utility patent since 2005 .
so how much flesh and how many potatoes are in the s@@ ke@@ wers , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to betray .
just as much : &quot; it ta@@ stes better together , &quot; he finds .
also with its customers , the culinary understanding will participate well .
metal cash starts ground fighting campaign for com@@ b@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - inv@@ entions
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di Record in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholesale accounts has launched a ground attack campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia up to a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia start to the beginning of the next year , strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing of social media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ tra@@ ders and suppliers ski@@ pped on board , with brands such as Polar manufacturers Sim@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop @-@ owner who sell to faithful clients for the South Australian Football League .
it is expected that Met@@ cash further details of his defense strategy will be published on September 29 , when the wholesale accounts for food , alcohol and appliances run through its annual Invest@@ ors @-@ strategy .
it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia account nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A charging systems and higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are now a more powerful market share as in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Eastern Europe .
however , analysts at Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di will take five months after opening its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and covers all existing actors , but mainly independent single retailers .
a report published in this week was according to the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley that IG@@ A retailers can lose € 360 million in revenue per year and met@@ ering $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predi@@ ction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened 25 stores in SA , 30 in the next year and achieve sales of $ 500 million and an $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in dietary and grocery , and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s with a high fixed cost base could cost metals at around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , primarily at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan had taken out that IG@@ A buyers are the most likely .
Morgan Stanley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in food and grocery sales by 3.8 percent in 2016 , to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business food in Melbourne , that metals will likely disappear in a decade .
metal cash refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass opened its last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food business , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , is reflected by the operating debt on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholesale accounts recei@@ vable and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to provide sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ on@@ ths among hundreds of products each week to improve and IG@@ A single @-@ retailers in improving their shops by growing rapidly growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price cuts and shop moder@@ ation programmes are designed and hopes that the large ta@@ iler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi co@@ the@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Federation , Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is ear@@ ns his praise as a criti@@ que for his behavior .
Than@@ asi co@@ ch@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; Coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick C@@ gios and ear@@ ns to view the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly rather praise to his own behavior .
Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os that will always be referred to as &quot; special KS &quot; in the country of the not@@ orious conflict of Kyr@@ gios and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka to the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati , soon , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan had to be separated twice with the arbit@@ rators , and Harrison said : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat the child , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he last saw how he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ ushing came up a potential US Open victory of Richard Gaz@@ ette , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing which I am quite en@@ vious is the fact that after my opinion of Than@@ asi a little was dra@@ fted into conflict , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket to the US Open , but he &apos;s not the first player who has broken a bat of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he really has beha@@ ved himself extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was a little not covered .
he is a very ripe 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , it is well in shape , he is good in shape , it &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved it , according to his own service activities .
He@@ aly did not support the decision that C@@ yr@@ gios must take into account the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for all , but he backs up the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent part into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to do that the team is fully concentrated on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ um &#91; Cy@@ ril gios , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I guess you have done Nick very quick to the promotion , such people like the Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray we have done . but we try to make him understand , we try to understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
European Free Great Depression : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , keeping the refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all certain who tried to escape illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
it was followed by the border as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian civil servants with indignation .
people who fled before violence fled for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ stration got up .
when a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried to ins@@ ults against the Hungarian Police Forces .
some was made from protest to food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that migrants were returned to Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ision rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il on the Hungarian Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c a day after a severe meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ ink of Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hope that , after the next month , or until the end of the year , there would be an agreement that the EU countries would have further 120,000 Refu@@ ge@@ es , including some of them from Hungary .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
but Hungary won &apos;t put his hopes for a bal@@ ancing action of Brussels or its neighbors .
on Tuesday , in two southern regions , officials announced more powers to conquer the crisis so that they could block the streets and accelerate the asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also has the construction of a bar@@ bed wire from its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants by the country - having completed a fence at the Serb border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners survived at the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the past months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to become a significant bott@@ len@@ ess and an entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban adopted , however , insi@@ sted that most of the emerging economic refugees , who are in search of a better life , and not war @-@ volat@@ ile , are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which come into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , whom the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws will also impos@@ e higher pen@@ alties for condemned traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still vote on the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters of Associated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country &apos;s security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have explored 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others had penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by exc@@ essive the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are going to rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
in the morning , Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border check@@ points with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the boundaries .
chaos decreased the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a total of human amounts to push down there .
around 20 they were able to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants block the main highway to Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would be fed up food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s 1998 lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continued to hold a double @-@ digit in the democratic race for the nomin@@ ation of national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face down .
Clinton has now decided to support 47 percent of democratic voters during the presidential elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent increase ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced yet , will receive support of 15 percent of democratic vot@@ er voters for the presidential elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion counts , what candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders recorded some prizes .
Clinton has a major head start in women and moder@@ ates , but its origins have been reduced .
their support for the men is significantly reduced , and unlike with 5 points , the difference is different .
Clin@@ t benefit with democratic ass@@ ess@@ ments under the age of 50 has volat@@ ili@@ zed and , and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton used a double @-@ digit advance at the Liber@@ als but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
about half of democratic voters expressed by the national elections in Poland they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some preliminary support and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidates .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons are current supp@@ orter worldwide above all of it .
the views are bl@@ ended with those who currently do not support us - only about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ er voters say that they voted to support us with enthusiasm , they will say less republi@@ can voters dispute its Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supports her in an open question , why they want the candidate who is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it &apos;s time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clin@@ ics support is also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
consent to the problems and the elig@@ i@@ bility is also quoted .
as the vice @-@ President re@@ jects the potential for the Presidency of the Federal Republic , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believe he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked by the elec@@ torate , he who would be their second choice , is Bi@@ den on top .
by Clin@@ t followers there are more than half that Bi@@ den would be the second choice well ahead of S@@ anders .
if bi@@ ds decided not to can@@ ise the nomin@@ ation of the Demo@@ cr@@ at , Hill@@ ary Clinton increases from S@@ anders from S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in running race to 30 points without taking him in the race .
five and fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton &apos;s candidate to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped to 78 per cent over the last month .
bi@@ ds is by far a second one in this measurement , but the percentage being displayed as the &quot; chosen &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is important when a Candidate is more important , Party voters call questions about elig@@ i@@ bility .
similarly as in the last month , no only democr@@ atically Candidate and potential candidate for those elec@@ tors have been un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates provide good results in general terms of the elections of their party .
multi @-@ innovations include Clinton , s@@ anders and bi@@ ds as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong guides .
the three candidates take advantage of hon@@ esty while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton &apos;s honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy - twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
the general elections of the general elections in general also refer to Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ olog@@ ically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
because questions come to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s having to continue any personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term Minister , most of the Democratic voters of the preliminary elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public .
yet half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion occurred in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans say that the e @-@ mail account has no impact on its general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion had been deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse than that .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as genuine and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for they registered under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
they do not hold 62 percent of those entitled to vote for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote is not too honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on the lead .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush from the best score will be hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 . voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches to Donald Tr@@ ump in the national event near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is also close to Donald Tr@@ ump , the latest survey carried out by C@@ BS News / New York Times .
on the two candidates , half of the support of voters drops in the new pol@@ l , and others fall dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continued to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was carried out recently on Fox News debate in the past month , rose 27 % in the pol@@ l from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son rose from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demo@@ graphic groups and tr@@ ump under republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , governor John Ka@@ herself , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins against Scott Walker , who fell in the lowest part , with 10 % support for the last month to now 2 % .
the former head of Florida from Florida , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in the third place with 6 % .
the error mar@@ gins during the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lic@@ ally voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was implemented in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son will rise in the pol@@ ls - it lands with 19 % support for re@@ public@@ ans , behind the b@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post was also clearly demonstrated by tr@@ ump .
with a look at one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some page names for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son thought to adopt Tr@@ um@@ ps of faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump last Saturday , during a campaign lasting performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to provide even warm water .
a dip in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood uph@@ eld the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ings
two years after a student pass a student of students in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ compl@@ ain against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood is brut@@ ally attacked and delayed until September 2013 , delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
civil servants said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked , while he tried to step on a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally mourned over heada@@ che , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood had not calling the emergency number 911 , after den@@ g was rewarded and waited an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police force .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms of goo@@ gle@@ ils and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national President of the Brotherhood , in order to bring advice , Chief of chief apostle Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members , par@@ ap@@ l@@ ilies began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle over the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Police Head , Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ si@@ ft report , Den@@ g was repeated with st@@ ump@@ y strength injuries to the head , the hull and the thigh bend .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies each year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ lands and their members need to be drawn to the account , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an accus@@ ation against killing third parties for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with fat@@ alities and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the participants , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - that has been sanc@@ tioned , so we will also draw it to account &quot; , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College is forbidden by the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood has infr@@ in@@ gement its affili@@ ation to the town .
that will happen when the F@@ ed will increase interest
a Zin@@ ser@@ rat is coming , and the house is going into a Wan@@ ken , R@@ end@@ ite for bonds will climb , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long will it take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for economy is only a small guide to the exp@@ iry .
a recession came within just 11 months of the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ sors of the Federal Reserve at lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor thereby , such as economy and financial investments .
thus representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so severely stressed that investors should not concentrate on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could determine that a result of an interest rate would possibly be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed ever since the global financial crisis is in@@ sof@@ ter as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ sop , chief econom@@ ist at the Economics International , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights but still at low level , in order to prevent the seis@@ mic shock that lives many to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is an emphasis on historical trends based on how some areas of business might react :
like the market in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things for a while .
as soon as the increase fails , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth produced 12 to 24 months after the first increase is reflected in the monetary policy once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German bank analysts believe in a recent study what has happened to the interest rate of F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the up@@ turn - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief of power strateg@@ ists at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to be ten@@ se later on the cycle , thereby reducing the margin to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ viewers are a fact of economic life , but interest increases are often promoting them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely interesting that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few are expected that this will last for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed &apos;s information only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate increases with such frag@@ ile economic setting can be ris@@ ky and asked the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made the whole year to a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were aimed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could gain a meeting in this meeting , there will only be a 25 per cent probability in Fut@@ ures trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all detection cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum during GDP and pre @-@ recession very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly am@@ big@@ uous recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was observed .
the current cycle is far the longest ever since the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession . the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market takes a rate of interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic class .
bonds appear to change the direction if the first increase is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the earth cycle , the bond yields dropped immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates is likely to bring closer relations between long and shorter bonds and lead to a cle@@ aring of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often bring better revenues in such a climate while &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ ine in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
in fact , Jones stated that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed &apos;s strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation there are few indications that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit card has expanded and the volat@@ ility has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed has deep@@ ened its strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and whole company , businesses who will un@@ roll out the larger proportion of their business activities in the United States will benefit from it when interest rates are increasing and local produce become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multinational company with high debts will be worse , since an increasing amount of money makes its products more expensive on the global market and also financing your debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ Analy@@ st said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded a average rate of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital tra@@ its as well as low vol@@ utions among their shares , also out@@ ward their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
company with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games , consumers also will profit through the rising dollar .
Spar@@ es might see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a replica of the Classic FM , says the member of Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament criti@@ ci@@ zed the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ id &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to distinguish some commercial ri@@ vals .
he also represented the BBC Music Awards , saying that they only have received only The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins &apos; put the voice to The Voice saying that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; at Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sender does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative Law Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evap@@ or@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly being different from its commercial compet@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; dark &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also represented the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ ane@@ ously mentioned examples of which you are just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Music Director proved the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 spoke in front of its commercial compet@@ itor when it comes to live music and En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I don &apos;t want to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 , new music will be found and new works on behalf , I also have really important for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller argu@@ ed that the British had to be engaged to describe the audience as it did in the past because the British are less about classical music .
the BBC 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which , while the Consult@@ ation of the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire came under fire to get the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Justice - was produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he wishes that the company finds it &quot; a hit from our company &apos;s own stable , &quot; if the next time it was a entertainment series .
however , he refused to balance the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to balance money from the pay@@ ers for different teaching formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est , and the Black Friday can be responsible for that
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales advanced 3 years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down the issues
for over a decade the virtual insert drilled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets are transformed into ancient capitals .
but experts say there are signs that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest point in growth since the beginning of record in the year 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are indications that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , then that during the time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sale method , said the Guardian .
he declared that the online sales advanced three years ago when buyers started to buy their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy them online and that people could do it in different environments , for example home on the sofa .
but now this one comm@@ utes himself , and we may experience that growth has been reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the previous sales .
experts believe that buyers will re@@ voke their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers had increased their computers to make their s@@ akes , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , in whom the buyer requests for bar@@ gains , buyers could take away to make purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium was found that £ 5 spending had been dealt with a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases can be carried out via web shop .
at the same time more than a quarter of people &apos;s clothing and shoes buys an online rather than in the inner networks in the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca as a crane accident at the accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned .
the bodies of 29 deaths are borne by Muslims in the first burial of Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia reli@@ es on the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group .
the Ministry of Health reported that overall 3@@ 94 people were wounded , after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried into the streets to bury the killed , killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca ze@@ al@@ y@@ side .
grief @-@ filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay attention to their respect , when the first of the dead arrived her last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m cemetery .
the proc@@ ession had passed on the Holy Place , where only days earlier a building crane fell through the veil of the mosque and then on the bed collapsed .
the bodies were released for burial , as the Saudi King over the construction companies of the Bin Laden family , due to the catastrophe , which left the latter also 3@@ 94 , left a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 people killed , when a crane fell through the Great Central Mos@@ y@@ side Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , was raised as the crane .
M@@ R Ak@@ ram was with his parents in front of the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ess in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the p@@ add@@ in turn to Mec@@ ca with thousands of who continue to come back to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man said that bin Laden has not been standing on the crane &apos;s arm , as he was not used .
a decree &apos;s Arab version of L@@ gs , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden has been responsible for the collapse .
the English service of the German news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad must not be prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was able to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Mos@@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come before the H@@ add@@ ess , which later occurred in this month .
the Bin Laden group has given no statements about the collapse of the Kran@@ z , and their representatives were not available to a statement .
the Royal Decree even t@@ opped the group because of no @-@ current security measures , and because they did not have surgery with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cro@@ ws surrounded by Mec@@ ca Mos@@ al@@ side as part of the massive construction , that is led by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia since decades and assumes bigger construction projects .
the deceased leaders of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a back@@ drop son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed from the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane was in the heart of rain and rain , only a few days before arrival from millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once needed in the life of every healthy building .
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government representatives obtained that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay at the members of the gearing , the same number of permanent injuries .
other people get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East @-@ European professionals is over
Brit@@ ons do more professional tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this leads to a further 200 new screening @-@ shops that will move on skilled tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time it will close King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales places nationwide
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Head @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it claims that Britain hold their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the setting of qualified Eastern European craft which carry out work in their home .
if you are sent to a hammer or a brush to mark the walls , they now belong to a minority .
the British employ more and more craftsmen in order to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree chain , said that a great increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , which offer services for deep prices has meanwhile been over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 more screens , which are directed to craftsmen and 60 sales places of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shop , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to introduce the growing demo@@ graphic trends that contain more female Single @-@ households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
we must make this stronger towards a balance .
generally , half of our customers from women are made up of 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decisive process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also resulted in their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
it is almost the sole company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the total team of women , including his management and CFO .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for the Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and the sales after the group owed the cost of closing the shops .
due to trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q there will be opening 200 new branches .
rules of a@@ I / D@@ ob because of un@@ faithfulness before the court
at the Provin@@ cial Court in Klagenfurt , on Wednesday two officials of Austria &apos;s vol@@ leyball , will have to answer , because of un@@ faithfulness and abor@@ tion .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them had been indicted for abuse of authority .
he was acquitted of this feed by the court in May 2015 .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Public Prosecutor of Robert Ri@@ pen had cryst@@ alli@@ zed up in preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants were in 2006 until 2011 , when the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions , were used for private purposes .
the damage is estimated with around 400.000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged on financial statements .
this fact was the Chairman of the Management Board , judge Michael San@@ in , retired .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the def@@ endant of the un@@ faithful laid the defence that no date had taken part of the association at no time .
the sports club had only been charges and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested in which they have invested a lot of time and money from the liabilities - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we still keep going to the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the lunch @-@ dish of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , with his colleagues and co @-@ accused he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have accomplished money , while our health insurance is laid down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he , when applying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the club has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , in the corresponding financial , the payout of charges had to be reimbur@@ sed until 1991 .
therefore one has to pay part of the allowance for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus has been on the account , paid out .
therefore , l@@ ump and non @-@ detailed drawings seemed to be explained , explained by the former Ob@@ mann .
the accounts and au@@ sterity - administered by both of the accused , said the other accused .
why no withdrawal could not be established in detail in the association , judge the judge .
the club has not been interested in detail for financing , but it &apos;s important to have the debt crisis , so the answer .
in 2011 , an amount of 120,000 Euro was referred to the general accounts for the year 2011 against the functioning of officials .
those had been rep@@ ay@@ ing , the def@@ endants claimed .
this securities amounted to the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
after that , the answer came not answer for a long time .
then he said that he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the Prosecutor dropped into the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endant had been informed , the functioning of the functioning .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage compensation . &quot;
why does vali@@ dation mean ? , judge and prosecutor wanted to know .
afterwards the first accused stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never been a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of you from the Schneider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard support more 30.000 jobs
in addition to the personnel design running since three years , the computer team will be able to reduce further jobs due to the expansion of the company .
the positions in the US computer Service H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) will not end .
in the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate client business .
as a result , costs amounting to $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of approx . $ 2.7 billion , which will fall down from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs in the past three years is still not finished .
today , HP had roughly 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent .
currently , with printers from the California Palo Alto region , the computer &apos;s computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new company this year - separately from the future areas with computer servers and data store for firms and other services .
both business vehicles are to be listed on the stock exchange .
once again a dis@@ appo@@ inting PC market as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer forwards to the Lenovo .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.5 % .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thereby the revenues were declined in 15 of 16 quarters .

however , a direct participation of German soldiers on combat operations in Iraq was mainly due to re@@ jection : 54 percent said , &quot; 35 percent showed themselves .
the fact that other states are air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 per cent involve a positive effect .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict .

time the decision on interest rates for the U.S. base bank
the world is observed when the U.S. Emer@@ gency bank occurs on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Reuters found that F@@ ed will do this , now think the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and interest rates will be on the current status of 0 - 0.25 percent .
it &apos;s a historic event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest was on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a big central bank would probably leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , billions of dollars are added to the balance and generate only a small amount of inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the opportunities against such a step is good .
your decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .
leave of death at the Delta State University left un@@ question@@ able
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the shot and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry for the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could do it inev@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; made public on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , Assistant Professor of Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he was shot on someone and someone killed .
later , Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired of the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police acts the scene , they found the body from Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry for me , I could reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
after the letter of the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing himself when he finally took his own life on Monday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing from a conflict between God and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Intro@@ duction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pre@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt also said authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ ish@@ iss was removed from Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en , who said that she was married about seven years , as a &quot; good man &quot; described .
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he and Pr@@ un@@ iss had a daughter , that is 19 , and it was destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ lu@@ iss had her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les that was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ lu@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
the police reported that Lamb has called relatives at a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he doesn &apos;t go into prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen climbed him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville to this night , he drove his car to the side , fled walking , running into the forest and killing yourself with a shot .
Lamb was obtained a Ph.@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , gradu@@ ating from the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the group
the Lufthansa plans to build a large group of group .
one half @-@ billion euros in the year aims to save the Lufthansa sector alone with a better organisation .
the group total 150 executives around the world will cost the jobs in the world .
with the pilot @-@ union , there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa is based on the business structure and evalu@@ ates the money @-@ to @-@ wings up to now .
the implementation of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from costs of cost and revenues , and the airline issued on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board for the passenger liner at Lufthansa in future .
the cheap line of the Euro@@ wings allow to be designed as own as possible .
head of the Executive Board for Head of Carsten M@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future .
with the re@@ lining , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Euro@@ wings to compete with the Group in future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Eas@@ y@@ Jet .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the roof of this passage , the airlines are renamed the three quarters of the annual annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new talks with the pilots
the negotiations with the pilot of the pilot Association ( VC ) , negotiations after the judi@@ cially offensive on this Thursday are to be resumed on this Thursday .
it divided the union with us .
the discussion on the discussion shall be the control of the pilot .
inside a year , &quot; in a year with a predicted claim &quot; results , &quot; faster possible results are possible .
the conflict between union and airline forces go to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is next to the driver &apos;s transitional provision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa will stop to the fight against competitors on the Group &apos;s own cheap product line for up to competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to two fre@@ action
with the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V , the Champions of Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double correction of his right b@@ eins .
while this is the right to defend the left and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give the hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the violation was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had collapsed in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field of playing and took the necessary oxygen before returning to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has double leg extension and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United which plays it very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
he had a oxygen m@@ asked at the locker room .
he was weeping .
I am not a doctor but if you have a double error , then lasts for six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to have a red card and the suspension of a bl@@ ond .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rators , but won &apos;t pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ect that the Italian arbit@@ rators were mistaken .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that a couple of yards and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws Account cried : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how do I destroy , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
they related to Manchester United for the loss of Luke Sha@@ w when the PS@@ V defeat .
the European defender in France has an additional inc@@ entive to recover an additional inc@@ entive in France until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to leave the place , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
Mor@@ eno denied a shot , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ als , who played the team at the FIFA World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said .
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that had gone in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult can it be . &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so tired .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és guar@@ tery was also taken into the hospital - after a tran@@ qui@@ cker by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents would soon meet : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it nearly out@@ ward .
unless you are David Cameron , you may guess .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron alien@@ ating in a message on the website of Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to have an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all well and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to re@@ mark the action of the book , instead repeated a sy@@ no@@ bility of the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text .
in the w@@ alled town of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a Mer@@ chan@@ y to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , dedi@@ c@@ ates her desire to be a real tree , &quot; reads , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but was completely unknown .
as though this is not yet susp@@ ect : the text written by Cameron rather reads like the Sum@@ m@@ ary of the Lor@@ ax In@@ dies , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes to win a boy called Ted to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he gives to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron causes the hearing of the book so little familiar , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ end Once Ac@@ er despite the protest of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , s@@ me@@ bear@@ ded entity that speaks in the name of trees , &quot; it will be devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper who did not read the Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ person said that the text is likely to be accompanied by Cam@@ er@@ ons directly .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no further immediate Comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from the English team , but it is still difficult .
in Pakistan , in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you selected the Kad@@ esh that has chosen the UK for the tour , a repe@@ ating the 3 @-@ 0 Test loss is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a revers@@ al victory .
A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ke &apos;s side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there is good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing @-@ schedule , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will bear no sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball the same name develops Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ l and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even though he represents an unknown size on the test level , is an option for the attack .
this message was related to Adam Ly@@ th from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is natural for me as its head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime novels are designed on results .
there were no question mark by Joe R@@ oot , for instance , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , there - and I said this - players are their own best cho@@ oses .
a long time ago would have been extended the race of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny .
if and hopefully further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss heard his attitude , even if it did not bring out such good performance , and this is not surprised ; he is mainly a team man .
the question how much time a test stro@@ man gets in order to set his character is difficult .
l@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine received .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play and play .
the only vine that could rise was that England gave up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - but it was lost in the absolute form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a bu@@ b that I estimate high .
he is a X @-@ factor c@@ cri@@ cket , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 236 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge &apos;s place that met us very much .
he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een alongside Cook , what would get an extra spin @-@ punch though I got 4 qui@@ cks up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can not strike there , and this left @-@ handed use has already been shown that he is a vi@@ ctor of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een probably does not have his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for it , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 test on the first drop before he joined as a open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ us immediately , and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach to him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see also his statistics on average , 31 with ra@@ cket and 35 with ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning who count their hands and the coach have chosen themselves for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England made a few wise additions at the train@@ ers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the ni@@ c@@ est guys of the game that will bring a lot of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has int@@ entions , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can take fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously ch@@ ased .
col@@ lage team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ since ; R@@ oot produced a similar rest against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some are not agree to agree , but coin and team actors won &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that , as with the players , they will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = descent Great Britain from the EU ) could not take effect when the economy until 2017 in a no@@ isy .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ fer@@ mented new negoti@@ ator strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , will be deep into trouble with every day , even without the choice of gen@@ ius Jerem@@ y , &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Führer firm of Labour or TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently stum@@ bled from Europe on Tuesday .
the foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ um .
a European diplom@@ acy interview and recent reports that some member states , as deeply sho@@ cks into different crises such as the EU is now and not always created with their own debt , Britain &apos;s own conc@@ essions and inter@@ pret@@ ending contract changes that they don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided to stop at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Ministers climb up at summit meeting or bilateral meetings in foreign cities , take a picture of itself ahead of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it always goes around me .
my European friend , who wishes to the UK in the interior of the EU , says Berlin - and lets us look back with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us know that more and more short @-@ term ministers and officials are at the point where there are no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s careful Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them as it did for the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated out@@ casts such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or re @-@ transfer in 2017 .
it is also a whis@@ per@@ ing force .
Poland potentially has a nation@@ alist government , Spain a left hand .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will get leg out on your leg to prevent the un@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of them have separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies .
therefore , some such ministers could even plan deliber@@ ately not helpful observations , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Great Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ ary campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , is probably my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re @-@ negoti@@ ation was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Great Britain has won nothing from the hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how burns the Fle@@ et Stre@@ ets can be on its cost and which is the EU scep@@ tics of the press bar@@ ons , as it did not have been inspired by Tony Cliff ( in 1975 ) , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
it is said that you are weak against Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro town of Opp@@ on@@ uni@@ sten , who made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
at all his decline , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
it belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ bear@@ ers , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able out@@ breaks and p@@ seudo non @-@ domestic countries which possess the most of our great newspapers .
in fact , Tony Bla@@ ir pushed something over them , but noted that if you are sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one was better distributed ban@@ anas , instead of walking for his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band expressed more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , as he turned on the principle of Cam@@ er@@ ons with the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was turned down by French and Dutch ass@@ ess@@ ments in 2005 , which he opened to him a back@@ door .
the press has never promised him .
but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fla@@ p on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to do any time for me - in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ k@@ ott ranks of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake earlier and today .
it may take time , but it needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , the BBC that he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe - I &apos;ll do it really friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ ah traditional blu@@ ef@@ ar@@ b@@ textile trend and the wild ge@@ fil@@ tering of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can I say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A P@@ enn , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; bass in the radio and on television that week , when the boy Scout was fighting in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was named by the pro@@ vo@@ des@@ man John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a Sch@@ att@@ ler .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father got engaged in TV , loyal to his Labour government drugs to go without far away and to losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told , nor what J@@ C told his fellow fighting and MPs to all reports on Monday evening .
what I want to im@@ part the right Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even has touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important at the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the Stru@@ del of the Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no ticket for Europe to give support of Lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ ary campaign for a person who said Mc@@ Donn@@ ell told it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundament@@ als fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for the EU membership , of their anti @-@ capitalist past - is not just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of a small under@@ taking is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his extraordinary activity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son stands that J@@ C will be no campaign to exit the withdrawal - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital - they also have ming@@ led voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the United States are already quite disappointed by the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction by the T@@ ory government in power , which was somewhat reminiscent of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .

experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) adopted to launch , by critic@@ ising the evidence of Public Health ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
P@@ he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; in the past month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have put their capacity to the capacity of the data and reference to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a mission article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month has established the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wide basis , &quot; at which P@@ he established his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers have in BM@@ J and asked if there are the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Practi@@ cal Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the effectiveness of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that &quot; the statement of P@@ he believes that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the reproduction and mod@@ elling .
indeed , this statement is made up of a single meeting of 12 persons that have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to make their opinions about the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote references from B@@ AT to the public health in a sustainability report , said it .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to receive a means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he reports from the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International for reports before reports .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but this will include several popular e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management was attended by P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no such connections or restrictions will be discussed in the present report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there was no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J re@@ acts on the alle@@ g@@ ations of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifetime of life is about his Su@@ cht .
all evidence suggests that the health risk of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison to this , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique mandatory obligatory service for the public about what is evidence and does not , especially if there are much public confusion about relative risks in the comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking cost the national health care system two billion pounds per year .
through the clear pro@@ ofs of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give East@@ En@@ ders , a former head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , hat@@ ch Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop programs such as East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give its right arms &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio registration fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK @-@ transmitters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that it is public @-@ legal programs that will likely be seen from a smaller audience to place over the most popular shows of their rival and transmitters such as B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC Music Director , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC in his time with Channel 4 in his time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC were on behalf of the BBC , or were to be shown clearly by not subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I think medium or long term is not responsible for a good idea , one should pick up his production at least on programs that do not make or put on mission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why an reg@@ res@@ sive control program finan@@ ces , which could be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ en@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own re@@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would cause their right arms to do so .
I am going to see how this is supposed to be public TV .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC bl@@ amed the hunt for reviews , &quot; for the amb@@ itions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC will give you the BBC &apos;s favourite TV shows that , in 2003 , seen the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk to the Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC will sell such as East@@ en@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more openly auto@@ immune programs can go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they are running out their tasks , but they can argue when they are moving on their apparent holy missions for justify 4 billion £ broadcasting fees ; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ents programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which nobody ever wanted to see .
for the broadcast charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find an aggressive system in terms of conditions , which can get the best value from this .
of course you think all , that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who &apos;s £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is correct , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should examine its Rei@@ chen@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; inform and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only a little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially classified as education - it said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should change this in &quot; inform &quot; inform and chat . &quot;
in addition to the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein argu@@ ed that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful could be scre@@ ened in television , and to make all commercial broadcasting allies needed to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des will change the direction in which it will be radi@@ ated with audio impul@@ ses .
scientists have grown wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous system that can be controlled from fr@@ eres of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in that moment in which they are heard as a sound impul@@ ses , which are used for the human hearing , to be heard and ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses are driven by the power of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are gene@@ tically modified to allow the di@@ aph@@ or channels , that react on ultr@@ as@@ ound waves .
another on this subject : to read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics to enable ultr@@ as@@ ound to enable a number of bra@@ ins , heart and muscle cells out of the body .
The@@ ec@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ a@@ sive procedure enabling electrical impul@@ ses to the brain for the treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ itt@@ di@@ ers react normally on ultr@@ as@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when the bl@@ ended , he found that the ultr@@ as@@ ound waves in@@ penet@@ rate , that penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ultr@@ asonic f@@ lin@@ ons operate on structures which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the dig@@ iti@@ al cells .
the sound waves affect the opening of these I@@ onic channels and activ@@ ating the cells , which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to make ultr@@ as@@ ound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , the wor@@ ms altered the wor@@ ms so that some of them are m@@ apping tr@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when using ultr@@ as@@ ound on the different creatures , the sound waves are strengthened by the micro bubbles and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ ions .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ e@@ tics , a pioneering tool , which scientists allow scientists to penet@@ rate and switch neur@@ ons with stim@@ ulus .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that some advantages could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , the low @-@ frequency as@@ ound tissue can pass imp@@ air@@ less and can be sent out to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with therapy and a therapeutic method it is possible to make temporary human neur@@ ons temporarily in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

the joy@@ ful voice and carto@@ ons do not leave any doubt that this ad has been produced for the world &apos;s largest weapons trade fair , which was becoming Amnesty International to deliver the will@@ ing@@ ness of the British government to recover weapons to re@@ pres@@ sive regim@@ es on Defence and Security Systems International Jam@@ bo@@ ree at London &apos;s Do@@ ck@@ lands .

but a separate campaign leads to many posters that are on bus stops and to the subway trains , which require a second view .
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the fon@@ ts of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the D@@ LR line that turns to the picture of a P@@ anz@@ er .
in September , a flock of weapons related to D@@ LR are sold ... Cust@@ omers will be asked to help the stop of the cease @-@ trade fair .
the 300 posters are exhibited by artists who have exhibited their work in the museum for cru@@ el@@ ly designs in Ban@@ ks@@ ys Dis@@ pos@@ al .
a collabor@@ ative with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used the Third Place H@@ ack Packs , &quot; a 6 £ 10 pack of in@@ bus keys , claimed that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising spaces are on the planet . &quot;
transportation for London finds these posters &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; not fun .
one of the par@@ ody advertising produced by special Pat@@ rol group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ in@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and professor at the University of Es@@ sex , artists became critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists are dealing with activists in the protest movements and notice that they must move into the real world outside , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ tru@@ cking posters sends the p@@ end@@ ler to the subway .
the Amnesty video was viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for a non @-@ profit artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over artists who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative managing Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed over the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons trade - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign that they attempt to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company ad@@ vert , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with light colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen consciousness about the sale of illegal acts of torture on the fair@@ grounds , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of am@@ nesty .
what we need now is a progress made by the British Government and the guarantee that the torture tools not be illegal in front of our door@@ step .

eight European rules for the life in residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence hall to a student residence hall , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ sw@@ elled complaints about others .
most of the things I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules .
the move in a student residence is of slightly anno@@ ying , up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is loos@@ ening to ch@@ att@@ ing : people tell from where you come from where you can &apos;t love Sab@@ bat@@ as , where you &apos;re in regard to Cor@@ by@@ n , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it is just a He@@ fe@@ kt ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe in through .
and help others to do the same - putting questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like to figure out with which you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your lashes were caught fire and they would be extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often transform themselves into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal summ@@ ers , but they are also the places where people wear and their under@@ wear are re@@ vis@@ ing .
herein , you do not think to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ver@@ ted people get a rough treatment at the university .
its room should be a refuge , but many student dormitories form a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture that can be friendly and soci@@ ally and lead to life long friendship .
this can be Hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture also allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want to go on our friendship , but you must go away so that I can get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a compromise is exhau@@ sted by soci@@ alizing - and send a text message to it .
talking about A@@ pro@@ pos : do it .
one guy in my residence halls had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by B@@ aking .
as you start the Uni at the climax of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , it is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I gave you something to cra@@ ck . so , and now I smile when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made delic@@ ac@@ ies is a good way to close friendship .
the inhabitants of their inhabitants are obliged to enter@@ tain , and will be associate with a pleasant surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
well mixed cl@@ ums@@ y from flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you knock on .
to steal foods is an important crime in residence halls .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but it is the taking of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they themselves to use , even if they cook inside them .
if someone ste@@ als your matters , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but do try to deal with so well as my fellow worker , who added her milk to the r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she &apos;s now in prison .
they should not make a noise , the people from sleep , or from the work .
it is not just about to be a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the prover@@ b , it is among the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbors , if it makes them something qui@@ eter to ask &amp; bass qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they re@@ acted on it with loud music .
when she started up at 5 pm , she would kindly let her neighbours have to sleep another two hours before joining her own music , shut their door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to be able to enter the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ al , if you have a co @-@ resident for your future marriage associations , who have to separate themselves and see them every day , and perhaps do not experience how they bring to them all their common friends ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but if a name is Mit@@ ed , definitely not your future marriage law , try at least to talk your flush of mind .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in its in@@ closed room , the border between a ul@@ k and the mob@@ bing setup is considered to be .
a good swe@@ ep is funny but it will take just moments , until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
get a valuable and am@@ using lesson for security , but you never have any one &apos;s room with to@@ oth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo provided .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then place into the freezer - but you should not wash their owners at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all @-@ standing , pi@@ ing@@ ling
the property business owner Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is build in the central @-@ based corner of the Eck@@ ental Hou@@ sing Complex for people who have not have much money .
so for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; there are not only refugees in living space , but also the only @-@ resident mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ deser@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; I show how you can easily build and develop good today , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview
thousands of refugees turn out for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus g@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how he can become even cheaper living space : he builds for several refugees in a project .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees turn to the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the significant accommodation in containers and gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a large part here .
in view of the refugee &apos;s flat we also need sufficient living room for the coming decades .
a whole ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey apartment building is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house only needs f@@ ew@@ est .
it simpli@@ fies the integration .
that is different , if one takes the people in blocks .
each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three main units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many fu@@ g@@ iti@@ ves are saying , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
fur : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the construction regulations have changed their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have under@@ gone my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated to do the more im@@ aging women &apos;s benefit and the regul@@ ating regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly .
it is still subjected to those who creates in a terra@@ ced house three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is room for this .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers did not have cars .
how did people react to their terra@@ ced houses ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who were accused of having inflicted mun@@ itions for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but do not deep@@ en the competition for paid flats ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is that : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but were built luxury apartments that hardly can afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the only @-@ resident mother or the Ger@@ die @-@ deser@@ ved .
I show how you can still build and build nice today .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : as you get the new iPhone OS version , if Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting up app , select &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some are done after installation on problems as they get an error message , which indicated that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users will recommend to use either , until the ons@@ lau@@ ght go back or try to update through iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to make space - but Apple has made it more likely to do this because you use a special tool to delete apps and re @-@ install apps once the process is completed .
it is convenient to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger unit , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple can &apos;t make sure that the update is continued , as the telephone may turn on half way and that this might lead to a reduction of the update .

the Social Foundation comes down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new Qu@@ ery firm was opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchase market , you will immediately get seniors and advice to questions such as care insurance or health care services .
for years , we have been exhibiting with our patient care service that often nur@@ sing homes are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely lots of questions .
&quot; we are not rarely accepted many achievements of the ticket , because the complexity of the insurance is hardly ever understood , &quot; explained the new manager J@@ utta Fun@@ eig@@ and who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist@@ i@@ ft and the Ci@@ ist@@ i@@ ft as well as the Amb@@ ul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
apart from the consulting services , the new Qu@@ ery firm also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for that purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , reminder training or a physi@@ otherap@@ eutic treatment .
the offers from the old town center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis are complete in an ideal manner .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ comprehen@@ ausen .
furthermore , there are also se@@ v@@ atives champion Bernd Bor@@ mann , business trucks U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
there are no luck in many places in the country . doctors - As@@ endorf still has good luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of the practice on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ag@@ ausen goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich assumes his successor in the coming months or half a year .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ str@@ . 6 .
it was a lot of sympath@@ y at the first glance , when the Fel@@ comprehen@@ sion met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently concluded its research education in the hospital and will also get along in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage can be well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was time I simply called them . &quot;
a couple of Müller was right in the idea of maintaining our own practice in the future of As@@ endorf .
&quot; the close and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families above the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also see himself to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage purchased the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is a fold @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , after his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ ch@@ â@@ tel and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he became a senior physician at the Di@@ ep@@ wood district and engaged in honorary positions in the DRC @-@ stand @-@ stand fra@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ipe &apos;s works as a home practition@@ er , his wife has specialized in the g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ stin ) .
the gar@@ bage , both artists , want to settle down as the house .
&quot; the final os@@ copy is out therefore &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after renovation the rooms will look like modern .
we are offering more ultr@@ as@@ ound examination as well as a long @-@ term and loads of performance EK@@ GS , and will need more of the speakers .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50000 euro , the gar@@ bage will receive a funding from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that practice continued on practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ eller &apos;s leader Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients have come to practice this year , according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ minor per quarter , in the practice of rock breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf , there is another home practice .
a positive side effect of the practical approach by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in the place of the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ipe in As@@ endorf .
if no success@@ ors could have found , it would have gone too .
who is attended by Werner &apos;s spokes@@ person , the way continues to live in confi@@ denti@@ ality faces : the seven medical specialists will be taking over the closing force of the field of the field .
with their departure end in As@@ endorf , an era after all the medicine was pract@@ ised there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ th@@ ausen &quot; remembers .
a little gro@@ m@@ uth don &apos;t feel it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will be sure to see &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ stin &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is comple@@ mented : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed forward to gar@@ dening , but now it could become different . &quot;
furthermore , the couple has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls were driven on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Minister for Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border will remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to ask an asylum request would also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of man stands in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Ministers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , also not via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia joins the &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would succ@@ essi@@ vely put forward the refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and to put cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister for Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in Ljubljana , however , did not look like this .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely in@@ acceptable , &quot; of Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary .
by contrast , the border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area .
even as the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Sloven@@ ian wants to use his limits for refugees but not at war .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system does not work , &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government stated that the first refugees tried to travel in the night hours for Tuesday to travel in Ost@@ ro@@ atia to the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
in the Croatian police , the Croatian police was able to attack them .
in 1992 , according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has continually met with new refugees .
they are predominantly for Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees who said the Minister of Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ jic said .
Moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also be bound to the Maced@@ onian Serbian Border , which previously applied displaced people to the Hungarian border , related to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade asser@@ ted , however , that it was there to involve certain different routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this . &quot;
according to media reports , a first bus had arrived in the early morning with about 50 refugees in the town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses are expected .
on Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were driving the whole night around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary made it , so the police have told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now be used to ob@@ sc@@ ure ob@@ servers of the previous Balkans , Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
the Minister of Interior O@@ sto@@ jic officially empha@@ sized that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees that have prepared appropriate plans for potential exp@@ elling situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia is the non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for mar@@ g@@ inal control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 and the EU partners have since then passed a good testimony as far as the standard of the border controls .
on the ser@@ b@@ ish side , there are still about 300 refugees firmly behind the Hungarian border au@@ n .
according to Belgian media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border mountains Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
if the remaining refugees are going to travel to the Croatian border , it is even un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic was trying to calm in the early morning at a local feast in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stop the debates on the alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be very high , in fact , to be very high refugee numbers .
you cannot tell whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
help from migrants to - harmful - Alternative routes
however , private workers had already begun to distribute country tickets to the refugees , on which alternative routes by Croatia are drawn .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , it is still not cleared of cleared mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police exist that a team of mine clearance in the border region was sent .
Bör@@ j@@ h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians is paying 30 million dollars
Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about the ring of Cyber@@ crime who have been accused of having been able to gain insight into financial reports and press releases , such as Business Wire , Marketing and PR news wire since 2010 .
with the carried out information , In@@ sider stores have been made to the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars have been bund@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s perspective , that even those outside of our country borders will be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further people did not take any further in the case .
most of the def@@ endants originate from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are expected to be in the United States as well as from Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , therefore we went with this action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
f@@ ed@@ Ex reports a dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ gig@@ ant refers to its acquisition in a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs for transport services .
the company also said that it is planning to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation period .
earnings per share fell by over 2.5 per cent at the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year which ends in the next May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expect a survey from Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller views , despite increases of price increases , aver@@ ages 4,9 per cent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher supplements for soil transfer of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it was reasonably expected that the result from the previous year would be increased due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will receive &quot; solid yields if they we@@ aken the weaker economic terms , especially in manufacturing and global trading , &quot; in particular . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , the plant plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 and 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , equivalent to the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex operated 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , analysts predi@@ ct the predi@@ ctions .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks responded to an expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex resulted in a decline in international priority installations that have stag@@ n@@ ating sales in its unit Express shipments .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex .
during the last quarter , sales for passenger transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger boxes and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result of higher labour costs in the cargo sector decreased .
in the market trading market , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares amounted to 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they concluded a 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at the most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week to visit Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time for the first time for almost a decade .
above them , at one end of the delayed , two @-@ storey seat of events there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chairman , Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and their colleagues will implement the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ time order from the Congress : maxim@@ ize the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an unexpected third @-@ term mandate ; financial stability .
and this third mandate could be part of the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the un@@ exam@@ pled rate of interest by the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy will show that they are soli@@ dly growing , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets might make the already clear F@@ ed representative to strengthen those volat@@ ility by the interest of interest for federal government - and be it just by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line is the most important thing they see , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief of economics at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , we could not raise the interest rate , the increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough just@@ ification and continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do , which de@@ file himself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Bloomberg , a interest rate would have predicted this week .
however , the financial markets expect to wait a F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased the sentence , it is because the strateg@@ ists ab@@ bey a blow as they promise that a further increase is far away .
in Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy keeps opening a sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets segment , Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to be very far to ease the financial markets , so that they should not become panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts compl@@ ying that a interest rate would extend the financial markets because it was the un@@ certainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month , the F@@ ed appeared to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow disappearance of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in the spring and early summer of summer , Y@@ ellen were said that in this year , in spite of the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase of the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
pay@@ outs have shown indication of a recovery .
although inflation steadily grew under the Central Bank &apos;s annual target of 2 % , the F@@ ed representatives told the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ .
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the last month after China re@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors did so that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would threat@@ ening the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow Cor@@ rection is now about 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences affecting the complex co@@ ats , when to increase the interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news concerning the weakness of the Chinese economy would not occurred , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. emergency bank .
now he predi@@ cts that it will be waiting for at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world economy is none of the major economic growth , therefore it is not to be involved in its decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the du@@ ck @-@ effect the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge in recent years .
the mere reference to the Ben S.@@ Bern@@ an@@ ke &apos;s statement in 2013 that the F@@ ed could close their monetary expansion &quot; causing turbul@@ ence on the globe around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ lac@@ ed by the F@@ ed representative , they can not only monitor the developments in other place , but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Art as Science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for the asset management company , Inc . , Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ sear@@ ches on financial market moves that are not linked to the economic foundation . &quot;
h@@ acker , approved member of the Federal Open Market Committee , en@@ vision@@ ed for a interest rate , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia added the F@@ ed to lower its mission statement by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions . &quot; in spite of limiting effect on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ ack@@ ers said .
one year later , the ed @-@ ed representative arranged these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like in 2008 in the first place , Adam S. Pos@@ en said a former member of the committee for interest fixed at the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ ons come not close to that level , he said .
&quot; she will surely not fall into the situation , in which she has anxi@@ ety towards a interest rate because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the Financial St@@ ability , and until this is changed , I do not think that the time should proceed .

Brazil &apos;s Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande conduc@@ ts nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women about how important food is during the time . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted in bre@@ ads , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all the nutrients that they need to build a powerful immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will be recommended to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make as mothers .
a recent study under the supervision of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a baby @-@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ward of the Sports Hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2,3 million Euro Sports Hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is to be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ long @-@ long sports construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports centre step by step forward : in the recent meeting @-@ session the continued construction application has been handed down without major discussions .
prior to another , the panel was also adopted by a regulatory filing for a mandatory statutory &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exc@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permit for a special form regarding the design construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , a &quot; medi@@ al @-@ roof with non @-@ mit@@ one First and roof top &quot; was set to be erected .
in the background of planning , the exclusive use of the roof top for solar plants is : &quot; thus , we get a wonder@@ fully large south roof , &quot; commented Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , the roof ten@@ ds to be mandatory for energetic reasons - otherwise stated in the development plan for less than ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
a &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan does not allow an &quot; exceptions , &quot; where the Bernstein &apos;s municipal council is generally rather restri@@ ctive for all their liberation contracts rather restri@@ ctive .
there is no recur@@ ring project at the turn@@ outs : &quot; we are creating a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and SV amber .
at expense , around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected from the school and latitude .
in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now also presented to the Land@@ lord .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed so@@ oner than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is confirmed by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of Land@@ s@@ ac , confirmed by the Land@@ s@@ ät@@ in Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
however , another decision on the Supervisory Board , and the D@@ ome on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are implemented , all the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be transported with fishermen and the existing internal center towards Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees who don &apos;t have to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au is said to have a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
when the question he wants to compete , came to the White @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game that declared himself ready to take the line on 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is a &quot; re@@ rating &quot; in each case , and a width of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; So Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
Fis@@ her@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ br@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the internal station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is entitled to vote both houses , until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ies , which has more than 35 beds , is finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county has planned this for 2018 unless the current renovation work has been completed at the We@@ il@@ heim hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Jo@@ iner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , stood contrary to what the house , that is in possession of the Federal Republic , will soon be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that should I close . &quot; as it continues with the real estate , the chner @-@ White was not able to say that there are several consider@@ ations .
it is currently a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a day @-@ l@@ ur@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming back &quot; so fishermen over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been recorded positi@@ vely from the employees &quot; positive and very evident . &quot;
a true perspective for the house where fishermen has been working as a che@@ er for more than 30 years .
he was invited by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical Director .
in the past decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again from closing time , com@@ partments were closed , for example the surgery and the birth@@ place .

two Tra@@ ctor plates are seriously wounded during their ma@@ is@@ ance in the morning by shots .
during the super@@ st@@ ence on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , there were several hunters in action , as the police shared .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were put in hospital .
as precisely it could come to the accident , it was rather un@@ clear .
the crime police was determined .
gener@@ alized 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their bodies dropped into a channel in Rocken@@ hausen .
a victim of a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent .
the wom@@ bs of the young woman was found on the Tuesday night in Rocken@@ hausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as Public Prosecutor and police arrested on Wednesday .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , a further 20 @-@ year @-@ old , deemed to have been deemed promp@@ ted by the statement and the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the dead .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after they were not met at home on the evening after a visit of a fall in Rocken@@ hausen .
when searching for a young woman , the investig@@ ators first cast out on personal items of the victim .
it resulted in a group of friends in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , and finally resulted in a sus@@ pic@@ ion of the 20 year old .
the alleged off@@ ender introduced the police at a channel in Rocken@@ hausen where the bodies were found .
according to the public authorities , the authorities were interro@@ gated to interro@@ gate the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put his body in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre @-@ led at the Port of the Haf@@ ner , the investig@@ ators cover him &apos;s surface .
the other investigations should then take place on the close circumstances in fact .
refugees who need is available : study war@@ ns before r@@ ents
the situation on the German housing market is sharp .
even more refugees are seeking a paying lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing lies in front of a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and seeking support from the EU , more people need to push on a market which has already been over@@ loaded in numerous cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income citizens with low @-@ income citizens to last paid @-@ to @-@ date apartments .
in order to un@@ cover the demand for paid homes , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
the result is a study on behalf of the federation &quot; social housing . &quot;
for comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees do not have to be obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many will stum@@ ble on the housing market , and rows of the long queu@@ es before the rental apartment .
according to the Federal Stati@@ stical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
but the negative development of the housing market not only lies in the rising refugee camps .
the study also demonstrates considerable savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany B@@ low a vac@@ an@@ cies that is going to grow from year to year .
currently , there were already approximately 77@@ 0,000 living units in metro@@ politan areas , including Matthias Günther , author of the study .
as a result , many hired people were living in big cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed for the lu@@ te on the housing market un@@ will@@ ingly to stay in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
the number of square metres per head has declined in the first years for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the association &quot; Social Order &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in the process , new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could not be paid to the property tax , and the basic rate for sponsored apartments will be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
additionally , the Alliance is necessary to ensure am@@ ort@@ less am@@ ort@@ isation possibilities .
the funding programme for refugee centres of the automobile ice is already well communicated in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available EUR 300 million available .
now the project could even be enlarged .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia have a hallway
after Hungary is practically no more di@@ stra@@ cted , there are more refugees crossing the road via Croatia .
Zagreb Rec@@ orders to grant the transit through Slovenia into the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous indeed .
Croatia is planning to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Minister and when it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Home Interior Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ jic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area already .
the EU country is not yet a Schengen country .
after the conqu@@ ering of the Serbian Hungarian border hundreds of refugees to Croatia have broken off to get from there in Western Europe .
500 people were come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , according to the Croatian television broadcast@@ er .
on the day of the day , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day do not su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia will cause the refugees to happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and do something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police captured the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighboring country .
most of media reports suggest that Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi rank in the Serbian town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach on foot across the green border after Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border , there are no limit of refugees .
this is where the border strike another thre@@ ats : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s .
now , mine clearance should now move a secure passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border ended , there is no more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police counted 366 times .
just before gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws sub@@ set the over@@ coming and damage of the border g@@ ore as a stra@@ at .
thus 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border capital Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the def@@ endants served in prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 political asylum seek@@ ers have been made in the newly formed border on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 % of which are the most important transition .
among the applicant , 13 families with young children as well as two older persons .
on Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees to be detained .
practically it has no longer a view to be granted in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after un@@ biblical view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most successful asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported and deported .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ car@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , there were only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to be ready to grant .
they collected the gar@@ bage , which tens of thousands of people in the past weeks left at the road@@ side .
gr@@ ille screens have been dismant@@ led and one of the se@@ clu@@ sion in the area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself at the aim of this building .
Austria reaches a few fu@@ g@@ iti@@ ves after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
furthermore , the country has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants still held government information in the country .
in Salzburg some 1,400 people are waiting for the further drive to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in open @-@ halls , smaller groups of refugees met on foot regularly .
mayor ordered &quot; The border &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy at the bridge on Sunday afternoon , when ten people suddenly stood with tour guides at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ one mayor , Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists who wanted to sow the train to Pas@@ sau .
because Germany was surprisingly hired on Sunday because of the refugee &apos;s stream in Austria , it was conclu@@ ding in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help , and those who ran together with two hel@@ pers and their cars over the borders to the Nah@@ e Pas@@ sau .
before , we tasted the un@@ trusted guests only once , with J@@ ause and Be@@ verages .
we have just said we bring them to Pas@@ sau by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we are very pleased , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in Wels , the planned draw@@ backs were gone up by ICE in a regional train towards Pas@@ sau , in order to be reti@@ ring after the short notice that rail traffic was discontinued in Germany , but was still trying to attempt over the border .
but the regional train was completed in front of the border line in W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , it is generally higher at the border .
the bridge &apos;s bridge with the Bavarian neighbors free@@ zes on Sunday , as previously a bridge , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends back ten thousands to us , is a logical result of an obvious holy policy :
instead of in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , on the establishment of structures , our Federal Chancellor hosted highly officially and publicly supported the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ es circuit of National Soci@@ alism .
bar @-@ bearing of these policy is not only the Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ted in the regions with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they who are pl@@ ough@@ ing have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transported land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they were invited and welcomed , nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge in view of the imp@@ ending refugee flows and the coming winter , to provide decent conditions for men @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be another greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,000 win@@ dy qu@@ arti@@ cul@@ ars
Konrad has filled all his hands with the intention of in@@ semin@@ ation all his hands .
Christian Konrad is it that his word has weight .
the government was employed by the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank in order to set up a quot@@ ing for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the original community of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been given a grip on the hand .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; it was told from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the housing of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without the great vor@@ tex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ mind &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; ky situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad anticip@@ ates a demand of 8@@ 5,000 qui@@ ets in the hec@@ tic year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 properties must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are expected to deliver 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already performed interviews with the captains of the national army .
and these had been secured to him , too , to create qu@@ arti@@ cul@@ ars for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it will be good , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , it is intended to clari@@ fy how the Church will help .
great expectations of the asylum coordin@@ ator also places the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ per as we . &quot;
the platform can offer private individuals un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , it is hoped that the hotels are empty in winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier had invited the standards to be more than &quot; very high . &quot;
in Not@@ e@@ times it could not be that quot@@ as must keep a certain amount of the towels or size of the bag .
for a limited time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
however , in contrast to the Interior Ministry of the housing , Konrad begins with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , from which one does not say without further into the vision .
convi@@ ctions must be its most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic any cost as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase her to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ c search had yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at step@@ han@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with approval .
Linz requested a better distribution
first not an opening of urban sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the establishment of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary to accept these measures , as the persons affected can , without these measures , is said by mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
other locations for the emergency shall be inspected for the emergency .
criticism of the division of refugees in the field of the country .
other areas must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone interview with the Bavarian Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has added a further preparations to the refugee request on Monday .
above all , Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German limits are not sealed .
the further trip to refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
but there are now the appropriate limit checks .
special trains with refugees to Germany do not admit that any more .
however , the protection of protection would be brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
once again , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger called for once more strengthened in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once again Austria lead to its fron@@ ti@@ ers , Austria is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the lead of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is a question of time
the General@@ management of the New ship@@ yard in the Swiss Industrial line is officially completed .
the listed IT Group S &amp; T is listed in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine how to invest in start@@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also to be acquired .
already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which defe@@ ats said some promises : &quot; the next run@@ ta@@ stic is just a question of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested in the location of S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the t@@ ch@@ c@@ En@@ ter , one third of the city of Linz , Austria , Upper Austria and the Confederation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is chosen by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as te@@ ch@@ c@@ En@@ ter .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there may be in@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ ner opened second business in the Ark@@ cade
in the new shop , vene@@ er @-@ hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ da wanted to settle a dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to p@@ ushing the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the di@@ ver@@ ized market @-@ ar@@ cade : finally , it has grown to get an increase in the form of another business local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business where it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , now it all rot@@ ates to have women hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets respectively starting from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks ago it was re@@ arranged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have suffered long if I still open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that even the vene@@ ering producers , who are at home in Bologna , was impressed by the idea of his own site , in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the greater land of Linz which we sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , whom even Italian roots .
your fashion interest has got the cra@@ dle of your mother in the cra@@ dle .
I was able to stay most when something is developing , and I can show new trends for competitive prices .
why some woman in sight of a nice hand@@ bag in delivery equipment , also the professional lady can &apos;t answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used to fit any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place named An@@ geber .
this property links you to a Billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for comm@@ itting .
whether he comments on foreign @-@ host@@ ile , journalists , as far as to the knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - candidates for the Russian President fin@@ alis@@ es the electoral struggle .
and cuts well on it .
the town is also registered in the small town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million belong .
the New York with the F@@ ailed fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many at the win@@ eg@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants place is closely related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the little town of Simone Wen@@ del made a film about tr@@ ump .
and what can the vill@@ agers think about his goal , most noble man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that the kind of exciting , however , is not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ town has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous ski@@ ps , in which addition to Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for public knowledge , comes to Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; ( 2014 ) also a word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
but he did not tell the king of hearts .
indeed , there is respect to the performance of the family , but also typically the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was a bit of big @-@ la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; random from the peak of the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - too high : the coun@@ sel@@ ors , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Tr@@ ump is made of the village of the coun@@ sel@@ ors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold mines in the USA .
founding of real estate companies were first real estate purchases in New York .

he did not catch Tr@@ ump , because he was cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the Director of the Institute of Pentec@@ ost@@ al History and Volk@@ ho@@ res , Roland Paul , is declared the film start .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of one &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the strong statements of the desc@@ endant .

Karl Stefan@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson &apos;s haste to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shift in the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed from the capital of the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m plays the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts of David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ello , head to London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the insurrection appeared not to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9,000 .
Today , Today , up to the Rat@@ ings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
Fel@@ lows Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki was obviously in@@ aware of him who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor is eventually lan@@ det , has been kept in largest confi@@ denti@@ ality .
and none of the three left girls will certainly not give up if they are the one who received the last rose .
but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day , before out of three two , checked , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood holds up his lips till the final on Thursday .
all three women rely on a lyri@@ cal way , why Wood is the perfect man , and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who was to receive the final rose ? &quot; could their answers to the is@@ yl@@ ons , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki are both quick - apart from himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a single relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment , when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ deg@@ ger ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought this during the whole course of the show , &quot; says Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is at the two feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable each together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the last week &apos;s visit made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m always booked on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to call whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was r@@ enti@@ ful .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that send en@@ quiries according to its impressive open day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches had banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a comm@@ ot@@ ion about how the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league Con@@ vers@@ ite during his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but chop the s@@ ula to his husband and Hay@@ den gave me the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t return , and also in the running game after injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ sc@@ ter Cam In@@ one reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by a team @-@ team coordin@@ ator of Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ he@@ y to forget his pat@@ ted f@@ ang and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is pat@@ ched on a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to have hoped Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian super@@ vis@@ as for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the game field later and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could no worse start in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing which now occurred , it takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne is promising the car@@ ving of his orig@@ ine debut in 2007 when a passport was leading to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land , with his own in Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

free voters want to challenge the position of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and parliamentary group Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the FW @-@ autumn cl@@ ap@@ et in large @-@ scale capital of upcoming years before a serious crisis : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wer@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get verification in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the District surveys of the Free voters takes place far to Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , different main areas were provided .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free State of voters .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will be over@@ thrown in the branch &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ai@@ wer@@ ger said .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN zone layer for refugees in Syria , as it did during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not possible to say about the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free State boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the Free voters as soon as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wer@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative recept@@ ors that are competent for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; Ai@@ wer@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the FW body criti@@ ci@@ zed that several federal states do not need to be consistently : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we w@@ ron@@ g@@ fully unified Germany &apos;s standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but that is not far enough .
&quot; the G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss .
we ask for freedom of freedom for all high school students who want to do .
a free passage to the G9 everywhere , where it is desired .
the Wall Street helps it to jumps on the jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German stock market has closed distances on long distances and within challenging course with winnings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the debate about the loads sold out of the nuclear phase have pushed the company from RW@@ E to a record deep in the meantime and left behind at E@@ on deep marks .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; some 30 billion euros of energy are missing in the German energy sector .

according to a dealer , a positive report by the US An@@ le@@ op@@ pres@@ music magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; was published by the weekend .

4 people killed after police officers were shot by demonstr@@ ators in Nepal . shoot penetration
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after police bul@@ lets fired bul@@ lets in a crowd of people who were demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
on the evening evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , there are about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered out of a police station , some of whom cast stones and fire@@ bombs .
M@@ R D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then fired up into the air before moving back down to rubber floors .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately apparent , why the material might be used , of which it is known that they can kill themselves , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , evi@@ dently a high death rate produced .
the conflict was the last in weeks violent protests in Nep@@ als Southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Madrid say that new provinces being made in the framework of the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political impact .
they were also protests in the western Nepal of Th@@ arus &quot; ethnic group who want to establish its own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent alter@@ ations since the 10th .
in August , when the four large political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal has been central to the centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process of devastating earthquakes in April , thousands of people killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ator developed this week over certain cl@@ auses in the constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new Constitution would enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Projekt H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday house at the Little Sea at Em@@ den has shape .
the investor publicly presented publicly plans for the project .
many others are more troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge .
for months , the closed doors had been closed , mixed , made and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort location at the Little Sea near Em@@ den are located on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the mid @-@ SM@@ Es &quot; system building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee .

but it was good to meet all rum@@ or now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million Euros in the discussion since months .
fier@@ y responses under sea bu@@ den@@ ces that came into the meeting , sh@@ out the pictures and new details about the wanted hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the Meer@@ bus@@ an owner and member of the Inter@@ pane of An@@ sel@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ z , who prot@@ ru@@ des all the others . &quot;

however , what happens in the area of a ha large area of the former inn , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only need to be a complete concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google will kick @-@ off donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL , O ) announced a double @-@ ment donations that will help 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees , who terror@@ ized the European nations , as they escape from the war torn and pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the announcement of the donations for donations to his blog .
instead of leaving a manager the announcement of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google staff who had fled to her family from Kabul , when she was seven years of age in her personal experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey there were many dark railway and bus routes , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people are looking for help many people , des@@ perate after the help of my family .
the donations goes to four char@@ itable organisations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Board , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global collected donations up to $ 5.5 million will be doubled to Goo@@ gle@@ .com / Earth to 11 million $ .

for slightly overweight items , weight loss may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not get surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert for weight loss surgery that has an editorial supporting the new study in j@@ ama Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to treat type 2 diabetes as a factor , but most studies were executed in people who are mal@@ nourished and ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , some degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone overweight is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers used in Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have been in a study since 2007 and compare these two types of obesity - Mag@@ enb@@ yp@@ ass and Mag@@ en@@ sch@@ flooring - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those subjected to surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI of those that had non @-@ surgical treatments was approximately equal to 29 .
of those who underwent a surgical procedure showed up in 36 % of the diabetes disease and was partially at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was dissolved just by one percent and partly with only about two percent .
Moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general , in general , better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group .
the researchers also over@@ look the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels throughout the time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - the mortality rate was reduced in five years , so the expl@@ orer Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team performed also the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group was lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , and increased processes in BMI ( 7.4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit in five years after five years , there is evidence of a study of heavier people in Sweden that leads the operation to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was treated with ob@@ ese people who underwent an Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conventional methods did .
although the new study did not show any advantage for survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said it was more re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI Group , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient has a BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for a long time , until we bring people to take it seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , the body with obesity and diabetes is very difficult . &quot;
love story is in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
it is a theme that is currently during Bell@@ et@@ rist@@ ik : a young woman , at times of school times , is extremely popular and aw@@ ful , hits the he@@ aters of their youth , and this fell in love with them .

&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the true solution of the refugees in the Middle East did fly .
the Tibetan @-@ bud@@ d@@ hist@@ ische guide called for it to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity are to be put to the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also empha@@ sized that the reaction of Western European countries had ad@@ mi@@ red a great deal of the refugees , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama , Germany and Austria , praised efforts to the crisis , he empha@@ sized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to care for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think on long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries . &quot;
finally , we must think about how the killing will be in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never been solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented George Wood &apos;s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 , and discovered that the violent action of the USA moved in a chain of un@@ question@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he put violence in itself , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four times increase in intake of hill@@ side disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
poison control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low alcoholic drinks in Georgia , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the inst@@ ances of revenues of disinf@@ ect@@ ants went on in children under 12 , the tox@@ ic@@ ating centres reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children disinf@@ ect@@ ant can &apos;t drink while some people do to im@@ press their friends or simply because of a mutation in the social media .
show videos on YouTube as young people disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly mixed the disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft drink water in order to maintain a harder drink .
younger children can be fitted with attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with earthquake , grapes and or@@ ang@@ sts , which are very attractive to children .
slopes disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very small @-@ infants can lead to alcohol already few sy@@ ringe to alcohol .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ising centre at the University of Kansas , California , and Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a whis@@ ky whis@@ key around but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Russell , a six @-@ year old girl who recently took four inj@@ ections from having been taken into a school for earthquake eggs in the school , was taken to a lap@@ se .
her blood @-@ alcoholic concentration was 179 , twice more than the threshold which was legally in@@ tox@@ icated in an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and wasn &apos;t able to go , when she came to the lap@@ se .
doctors den@@ ced them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , since the girl fell through the alcohol and had compassion on her head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ bic@@ s &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez ( Lop@@ ez ) of both parents and teachers are recommended to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant agents outside of the child &apos;s operating range .
other disinf@@ ect@@ ants were in@@ sufficiently connected to death cases .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario , after the termination of hand@@ lers , which contained a toxic , non @-@ cle@@ ated ingre@@ dient .
staff of health authorities informed that the product contained the product of me@@ thanol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been recorded as active ingre@@ dient .
in January , three students of the fourth class were trained in the state of New York to po@@ is@@ oning &quot; an apprentices@@ hip , by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .

the police looked at the sh@@ allow@@ able Plan as &quot; F@@ ender tz &quot; and declared disciplinary action to the school authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bo@@ red up Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there are no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the leader@@ boards .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the leader@@ boards are not there .
people here not only talk about the return of the leader@@ ships .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there are a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland that want to see these games .

&quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ila said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry , or sad about what happens .

we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the player better .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it is increasing in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period May until July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work in the United Kingdom retained by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was an unemployment rate of 5.9 percent , and the number of office for the National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland increased by 12,000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland increased in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the annual UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David commented on the latest figures , saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long term plan of the government has laid the foundation for greater economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced additional improvements on the Scottish market to increase employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except for a late law intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not done , I will sit in an audience gallery in the shadow of death in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Com@@ bin@@ p is executed by the tox@@ ic@@ ating .
he asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I had been sho@@ cked , I voted in .
when the day approached , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agree as I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists must see exec@@ utions in the United States and there are often more applications than places available , there will be a ma@@ xed Lot@@ tery to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected , will be tested in the engine range .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not allow me to take a not@@ ebook and a pin to record what I see .
I have to try to remember all of the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give my dis@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive approach .
I compl@@ ained with her .
they realised that &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but it still thinks that it is false what I am doing .
Richard Com@@ fort@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have written , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I have told him that he can point out from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to be there that a international journalist is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard Com@@ bin@@ p is innocent .
his deeds , after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , will help him to be a bene@@ fici@@ ent of the facts .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be objec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ters which you can turn on .
what you will get from me is what it means , a man will even die unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards went to record him and threat@@ ening to exit the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria had attempted to install a Spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he led to ste@@ wards and the run department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on the occasion of a racing day treatment , which led the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do that which is best for racing , and he himself had found themselves under difficult conditions as it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test sample near Li@@ dar@@ is , which he could not explain .
he had turned back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying complaints , and didn &apos;t want to see that &quot; it looks like high sti@@ cking grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say anything about this , and I have taken long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes up at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said .
I will go home tonight , and I will sleep well .
I would like to go about the main conversation , and I would like to think that my owner wants to try out my best to them .
if they start to think I do this , I should not be a coach .
I then have to think what I do with my license .
before that , Moo@@ dy had developed the bomb with rac@@ ing@@ .com in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , that the integration department had attempted to cut off his barn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 18 months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , sitting in a room with a husband , I will call and provided free employment in my st@@ ables for information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they apparently believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should surely deal with their n@@ oses , because they were able to take hold of me .
Robert Ju@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ w , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of it at the time and are still today .
am I supposed to bring this to the mind that it is personally determined ?
does the R@@ V@@ L cra@@ ven , and makes people responsible out of train@@ ers who are going to work in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think there &apos;s out there .
perhaps they have to take my license and put me off , and I have no doubt that what I say it is thinking about it now .
but I &apos;m just arrived at the point where this doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ alt the pressure on her , and ur@@ ge them to make a decision .
I have got the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the train@@ ers have up their long @-@ lasting Cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching lead to it that he could cast down his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known through his preparation of the un@@ beaten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing day treatment rule , &quot; after a pack mud or sound was applied to the horse &apos;s de@@ buted , which viol@@ ate the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to assume responsibility for the full responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my personal assist@@ ants lost acci@@ dentally to the leg .
it could have been that night yesterday .
it would have been so far this day , what was like that .
it also had such a racing day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on racing day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy spread against ri@@ vals for alle@@ g@@ ations to Ring@@ ve
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy , Criti@@ que of the Tac@@ tics of his player , has been referred to as &quot; agenda S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League performers of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee can win the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ strive &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ Victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett made an un@@ coated note to the Storm @-@ Team , after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night . he named the game a &quot; para@@ dig@@ m &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League , saying that the two from Queens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings . &quot;
Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his team and said that it is only concentr@@ ating on its &quot; contact &quot; during Tac@@ tics .
Bell@@ amy added to the fact that the criticism of two leading co@@ aches in his team are confident that it is by trouble that they made themselves about to be beaten by the Storm @-@ team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson was over Ring@@ dro@@ fe when she was beaten 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our practice @-@ intensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus and that made a turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not likely to lose it , so it was a bit of shock to him .
it is strange that this time to come again during the time of the season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or is that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ g@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; d@@ ull &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he gave his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a d@@ ull team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath .
but now he has a team that can play and that we are exciting as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
that is the ball game that you want to play , if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt as they can play these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit wor@@ ried , against us to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t remember us than it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm of Roo@@ sters achieved a higher score than the game of bronze to cow@@ boys .
the game of the bronze was a good game , I haven &apos;t looked at it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is this a exciting game ?
or are breaks and not a point exciting ?
for me it is the timetable .
when we mention it , it means that we will meet in one phase even on them .
the Storm @-@ team is free at this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Queens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . tickets start at the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200,000 $ deposit to drugs
a man who could possibly threat@@ ening a lifetime sentence due to his attempt to catch in possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , who were mu@@ g@@ aged in Queens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 security deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ opter@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the Federal Police found 100 kilos of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the J@@ ach@@ ena during the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for an attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , it argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that could have been in the Café , for an harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan was wor@@ ried about the risk of explosion at Mak@@ si@@ opter@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often goes to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
with the case of pen@@ al , he weighed the police on his position .
Jesse &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to secure his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the hand@@ held declar@@ ations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to withstand him , but he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was set up against security , under the conditions that he returns his Australian and his Serb passport , reports on the police a day and are holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

the third driver considered it late and tried in vain to turn left to the left , as the police shared .
the operator &apos;s cab rest@@ or@@ ated completely apart .
the driver was heavily damaged in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed via six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
it originated a damage amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone number of girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
a p@@ ud@@ op@@ hil@@ ic used the telephone for a 11 year old girl to call pictures of childhood abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the maid of the girl when I slept in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of unexpected pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl got up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
she looked through , found the conf@@ essing messages and al@@ armed its mother instantly .
the police looked after , and looked after the five images , analysed computer , found under the address and discovered the &quot; Web research , &quot; the terms for searching for un@@ affected pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g stated then against the officials , that he had done it because it would lead to &quot; p@@ est oph@@ ile on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; admitted , a polic@@ eman to be frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the attor@@ ney at E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson , said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , it would be a Su@@ cht - that he is addi@@ ctive for people to be frigh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave heed that the sear@@ ches were done on the computer from him , said that it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to dis@@ ma@@ ze p@@ est p@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked that he asked to send more pictures .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found her messages written on the phone , she called her mother and was in the cit@@ ement and the weeping .
then she saw the un@@ standing pictures on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and told that the accused were using computers and Playst@@ ation to speak with girls who were younger than he .
on 25 January this year , H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e stated that he pleaded not guilty before the start of the indictment and on the 25th of January this year to appear before a court appearance on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ in asked that H@@ og@@ g is not appearing in the tab of sexual perpet@@ rators since they argu@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postponed the judgement until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted cau@@ tion in this case , but was held pre @-@ trial because of hearing the hear@@ ings in case of hearing .
he was still accepted to the list of sexual off@@ ences before the date of the judgment .
m@@ user soft to small limit trans@@ itions to Germany
increasingly on the side of the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks are caused by fear of discovery and celebration of people on smaller border cros@@ sings .
at the Austrian side , said a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police .
during the river Inn Pas@@ sau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been captured along the Pas@@ sau and R@@ ott@@ al Inn .
they were about walking across the bridge and the reservoir on the German side .
there they are taken up of the police officers and re@@ directed to the registration .
pursuant to Bundes@@ police officers , the Munich Main Railway Station , according to German police , clearly decreased more refugees .
at 8 a.m. alone , approximately 700 people are arrived in the state capital , saying one person to the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of inspec@@ tions on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : sp@@ urs of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected

thus , the Sun starts to look back on Friday .
for every two years , the car takes their innovations to be shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
2015 is mainly involved in the compact car that is currently very well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for at the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Award July 17 @-@ 27 ) .
this year , among all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars and luxury cars are presented mainly in new compact design models .
one of the major premier@@ es for the German car is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
this means that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel presents a step below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in a view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from € 16 990 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter diesel engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse range more diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
different from the most important compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra will initially focus only as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
and what is the Astra still moving on new compact cars next to the Astra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitors in the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a fifth of a conventional and a spor@@ tive GT version at the fair .
he comes to stores in the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan branch is planning to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the design line of the brand with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
this is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power rating of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is calculated according to manufacturer data of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno area in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely new is the compact model DS 4 , which is shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
outside the outside , the designers of the noble Citroën presented itself mainly to the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the altered head@@ lights with LED technology was installed .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ting system was upgraded in particular , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and include Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the International Commercial Vehi@@ cle Show in the compact class a series of over@@ working and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GTI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell human cells are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court has admitted to an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial competence of Te@@ gel , which was accommodated in a small cell in many months .
because of the violation of her human rights , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are accommodated in too small cells .
this decision has decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the persons concerned may even trust in money if they were locked up in confin@@ ed spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus a former in@@ mate was successful with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not isolated .
after that , the man , who by the way of his lawyer , had now resi@@ zed on the free foot , was moved to a bigger cell .
because of the unexpected safety conditions against the State of Berlin , he failed because of the un@@ worthy arrest conditions .
however , the judges accepted the verdict of the Berlin Chamber ruling and presented the case to the renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s face injured .
chamber uph@@ old now decide on the amount of the compensation
even though , in the period of legal reasons only a few days of arrest for the compensation plans to be decisive , it was granted compensation .
otherwise , &quot; a fi@@ br@@ illation of the legal protection of personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the Chamber has now to clari@@ fy the level of inc@@ enti@@ ation .
the judges generally have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus , in April , they said one of the prisoners of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , because he was imprisoned in his prison cell .
according to a decision by 2011 , the most multi @-@ occupation of a cell without separate toilet .
Moreover , in November 2009 , Karlsruhe confirmed the Constitutional Court of the Constitutional Court , which had agreed on a fellow prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ffs lived here over three months between 15 and 21 hours a day in the small cell as at the Karlsruhe Institute .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had arrived in the head@@ lines in recent weeks , too .
prisoners are therefore kept back again for 23 hours , but the aggres@@ sively increases , even to w@@ ast@@ eries , because of the ten@@ sion@@ ed situation .
according to the judicial regulations , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of a young talent , 19 are due to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the Refu@@ ge@@ es policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to proj@@ ections from the German Ministry of Interior in Germany this year , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany , according to statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is capable of taking a million refugees .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in view of the extraordinary challenge of the determination : &quot; I say again and again : &quot; we can do that , and we are able to do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany , gives the following overview .
the estimates are needed after a number of proj@@ ections from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the pest@@ le Institute ) apartments every year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but mainly due to affordable rental objects : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental rate , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to be created and would have to invest in the amount of 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister in Germany agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the Institut für Arbeits@@ markt@@ forschung and Professional Research , 55 percent of the offen@@ ders in Germany can be employed in the long @-@ term .
however , in Germany the refugees in Germany did not ask their quali@@ fications to help them go through , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to see if they find work in Germany .
work was the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ill@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ones , a political turn@@ around has been announced : the banned visits for refugees in recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the resi@@ den@@ ces are limited to a residence .
in the company , also because of the professionals , in particular , the vision is advised that refugees have to enable more refugees to have access to the labour market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing German language skills .
so far , there is no sufficient offer for general and professional @-@ related spoken language courses .
studies show that employment is most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
according to the management of networks , the king &apos;s establishment is fully integrated into the integration process .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents have their children in the day@@ cares , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root parents &quot; it is only very important to join the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Cos@@ chem@@ y , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
however , to convince the family from the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration is spread in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators strongly increase by the great number of refugees , the sen@@ ate sen@@ ate would attempt to increase the training capacities - by trying to allow more professional schools .
students without their German language skills are prepared to classes in the countries .
they are not always taught by trained teachers and teacher , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack of , &quot; Be@@ ate stands at the Berlin school administration .
the German Student Union estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
basically , no federal or asylum seek@@ ers or papers submitted the study - the only exception was Berlin , Wi@@ en@@ en@@ ator Frank &apos;s ( CD@@ U ) but abandoned his position now .
in order to study refugees , the access to the university could be facilit@@ ated .
for refugees with a resident or community do not receive any performance after the asylum seek@@ er , if they start studying .
the latter are in principle not getting any B@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they will not fall under the circle of the persons .
Ged@@ ser refugees have had to live for four years until now , to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 this span was shortened to 15 months .
but this funding has to be closed , however , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should get b@@ af@@ e@@ y immediately .
Islam will in future play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of its identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches are developing right to develop a new state religions @-@ relationship .
important would also be the establishment of a Muslim community in Paris , which cares about the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belong also to these rights .
so the representatives of Islam have to be in clear contact with some and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the will@@ ing@@ ness to search for religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , ou@@ sted the concern , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish those conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed that the Basic Law is to be translated .
in the future , much more people will be a topic of the whole society yet .
this will also change the majority society , a reduction of discrimination against discrimination and rac@@ ism .
in fact , Germany has proven itself as a result of European decisions - for a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general equality law .
however , it is getting very slow , as the NSU tri@@ ad series showed , at the police and authorities to ignore the r@@ assi@@ stic motif .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and those interested parties do not want to demand for a long time and to what international agreement as the anti @-@ terrorism Congress in Germany , must be reality when the country will remain peace@@ fully and its new citizens will take advantage of it - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to support medi@@ cally care for the expected refugees , physicians , fac@@ tional vice president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; as Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money is required to flow into the system .
to avoid commitment to slide , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all coming up to the registration of healthcare types .
achievements could be delayed later with federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited output catalog we see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , the doctors do to abol@@ ish the language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated that migrants are po@@ orer of their ill@@ nesses as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices , inter@@ bank charges have to be taken over , calls for them .
many refugees too had been helped with more general medical applications in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
among refugee kids around , there are much more un@@ treated disability , and among the young people go to HIV @-@ education .
at the beginning of their education , German doctors , along with the other cases , took part in the study of Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; parasites sof@@ ten or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and what the medical tem@@ per is concerned by wander@@ ing even in sight by the refugees .
the Syrians could have a highly developed education system , some refugees or even doctors .
in order to have pract@@ ised , they would have to prove their qualification and if possible , if necessary tests .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psych@@ olog@@ ically ill , according to estimates of the B@@ und@@ esp@@ a therap@@ ies ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , mentally ill : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic interference or in depression .
refugee kids were especially vulner@@ able , declares Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study of TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee children are trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
who is suffering from post@@ trau@@ matic interference , among other things , is suffering from so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with short@@ ness , sw@@ ing@@ arm , heart rate , and death .
other symptoms are insom@@ - and concentration of problems , severe sho@@ ck@@ ness and emotional im@@ b@@ ness .
to avoid that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
nevertheless , only four percent of psych@@ olog@@ ically ill refugees have received a psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psychological ill asylum seek@@ ers can introduce an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social conditions there were mostly experts or doctors who are not trained to the mental illness , whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to failure estimates , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false address in Parliament
M@@ R Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest son , retired from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ released , but the video of the case spread quickly on the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also imp@@ rec@@ ted by claims by dep@@ uties of the opposition that they had claimed to have been made anonymous and warned them to join the Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ons .
in the past month they had spra@@ yed him and wounded him during his speech in the state of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politi@@ cian messages received SMS messages left on their mobile phones , which she warned against Mr. Mu@@ playlist .
&quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , said journalist for mu@@ ff@@ it .
they war@@ ns the members concerned that the imm@@ unity of imm@@ unity ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will take about 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts under the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split into two listed companies and to split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job construction leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP stated in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will be a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , that should lead the unit according to the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the HP today , and we have a wide and sophisticated portfolio of shops that support businesses with a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has an annual turnover of more than 50 billion and will be focused on delivering un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electric plants and whose Palo Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive re@@ structure to cope with the conversion from traditional computers to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the conviction that a very focused company will provide better performance .
FC &apos;s ar@@ senal Mi@@ kel Ar@@ eta says that team @-@ mates will have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ er .
W@@ enger empha@@ sized opposite Wil@@ sh@@ er that it was only in September and that when its rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss on at least the next four matches for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly not uncertain .
the great shame about this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ er had stopped the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to its old sponge during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening his career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that healed not well .
this is no major matter .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from the medical point of view , but as it is well recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return out in the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant sample .
the investigation by Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has written 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ er since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 dynamics in the last five times .
the wider picture of Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 , most of those in the season .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of an inflation rate , but ar@@ senal estimated that an improvement in the danger of injuries during the last season is going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you get back from a violation , you have a man@@ ic@@ uous period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win the fight @-@ force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he is going through a career of the kind which he deser@@ ved .
Arsenal begins his Champions League Football season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb against the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces himself one turn within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu to Deb@@ uch@@ y and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
it is also possible to begin with k@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need to allow a short bre@@ ather &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the games with the biggest ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched during the last season .
the stadium was struck on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , with the Richter scale was 3,2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal had pulled the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League @-@ surrender to Monaco , and remains from far hope , with his management led the association to its first European Cup @-@ triumph .
&quot; this driving force is immense , &quot; he told W@@ enger .
it has never been managed with ar@@ senal .
we were in 2006 very close to this , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship fixed : the comedy show , which made us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obviously , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now being more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how self @-@ rep@@ ay@@ advice amongst young men would prove to a 15 @-@ year high @-@ high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important case of death for men aged 20 @-@ 45 , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ections ( CA@@ LM campaign against a her@@ ical life ) 2015 than the year of man , aiming to ask the culture of asking help if they need these .
friendship is the heart of the battle in order to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms reported that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mind &quot; , its chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a group of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends are involved in mental problems .
of course you have to have some friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more than social media led communication , focusing on the style of substance , the in@@ ability of response is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strongly , life @-@ fun and successfully , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial values call ; money , image , social status , everything on cost of non @-@ interest values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship which affects our spiritual health much more deep .
and how a video game inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was on its head .
every character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality who sh@@ ined by interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ &apos;s frequent U@@ mar@@ gins , Mom@@ ents in soccer , cozy arm@@ chairs and desire for Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men may refer to any case , even if they are often rec@@ eding to explore fully their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of the telephone past@@ oral care has stated to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who are often feeling de@@ pressed and self @-@ native , has clearly showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ mp@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to correctly , and has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when one speaks about problems &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes into the sense when I try to provide long @-@ term management mechanisms .
it presents very clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very much H@@ t@@ itious out@@ board Status above the telephone number the people in moments of des@@ per@@ ation also may help you have long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you &apos;re on this weekend served Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest , with celebration of the day completely re@@ designed setting , why do not take your friends on a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , when you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks one alone , give him a smile and tell him hello .
you never know what difference could your friendship be .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to grin@@ d in Malmö .
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit in Malmö .
di Mary , during his debut at the Champions League , will be held on Tuesday and assi@@ sts PS@@ G to Malmö .
here are the game @-@ report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stayed in Paris as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Mary met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player , which brought the French Masters on the way , but afterwards , they missed a range of opportunities by order to finally achieved a head office as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with real Madrid and Sch@@ a@@ ye@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A requires a strong start to the Swedish master , as they do not only provoke the qualification for the K.@@ ov@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was no class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ in Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the Tor . he later became a game against his home town team and against the club , with which he began to conf@@ use his illustr@@ ate career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to create our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good mark .
we wanted to win and we won &apos;t win , even though I was regre@@ t@@ ted that we don &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
Ali@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in any of three modifications to the Paris team , who managed to hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but it was em@@ itted by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing of the Argent@@ ine@@ an was named as the man who was taken over to the next level in Europe when he fled to Manchester United in the last month of Manchester United which he entered into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass , before he ended in Johan Wil@@ on in the long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , stood on An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and was excited by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle area .
but besides a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ jic , who ha@@ sten@@ ed far to Kevin Tra@@ ctor posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they reci@@ eved a little bit of the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself stated on , with some failure and ill down@@ ps , not least of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was pat@@ ched at no less than five trials alone in the first half and abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless , he insi@@ sted so much more stories , when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a Pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was turned into a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole .
the second gate was finally , after the hour of Cav@@ ani , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus scored his sixth year of the season after Napol@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had left the left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all thought that Malmö could escape the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ amb@@ ition , could stop the final result of low before it was recognized as a substitute in Lav@@ e@@ zzi .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League Game was last year last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games are not sufficient . &quot;
hat to front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was playing for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion Champions League , two times winner champion , two times champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now released , which was before the release of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid was then everything we didn &apos;t want anything , &quot; he tells .
and this is also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Romanian wanted me to have . &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today works for the German record leader : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola on contract and I played a great mistake . &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP has told me that I would not change that he could not be able to present the team without me . &quot;
&quot; he has deceived me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria released the 2008 / 2009 season with X@@ avi .

Matt Dam@@ on plays great variety in film@@ making
Matt Dam@@ on faced the af@@ ro@@ gan@@ t film@@ makers Eff@@ ie Brown in front of a discussion about the diversity and said they are not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown found this as the need of alternative perspectives , while having regard to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you will do it by the lin@@ eup of the film and not at the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted , with offended un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian resigned .
Dam@@ on and Brown , the organ@@ ist Ben @-@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers started to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - as she will be dealing with the character of harmony &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line of sp@@ lines , which is beaten by its white hal@@ ves .
the producer of De@@ er White People bet for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; at the end could give something something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the social media will explo@@ de out of dis@@ approved via Dam@@ on comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni , expressed his rage on the clip , wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - it is SO W@@ NO@@ WS that it hurt . &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
women &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact representation of political representation in the media is at the fore@@ front of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter generated nationwide control and urged law@@ makers and authorities to enjo@@ ined discri@@ min@@ ating practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning forever ) .
as books and black life , albums still have their importance as well .
in younger time leaders of the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation , while in response to the question of Fox News @-@ personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group was considered as a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was found on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
he accepted the invitation , or has already met the pop@@ e , is un@@ clear .

the competition show , which completed the 7th season , had never seen a competition of competition , which could finish all the stages of its obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman in Brit@@ ten , until the final .
climbing for the last task , climbing at a 75 @-@ foot walk@@ way was in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the assignment within time with which he was the first ath@@ lete , which finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . but Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds faster , making it the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock about winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than $ 10,000 or life , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ aps money .
so suddenly .. like I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leader producer K@@ ent We@@ ed won with the Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why British , although he finished first at all of the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , money is paid to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it comes with the fastest time , &quot; says We@@ ed .
as is the money a wonderful price is and the life changed , he ob@@ tains the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I do not believe that he boo@@ sts it over a roll .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad , that it is Isaac . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers grin@@ d at Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ I APO@@ TEC L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the ti@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to rise within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , though only for one night it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word , which was so difficult to gras@@ p over a large part of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ m .
tiger @-@ P@@ it@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit extended three times in the first two inner positions , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) put 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and gave three rats .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and so I want to go completely over into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits against Seattle on July 6 .
&quot; he sha@@ ved the stro@@ mat@@ s well , &quot; said Aus@@ m .
he looked good at the ( bu@@ si@@ est training ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ do@@ er , and he brought it directly to the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finishing the inning with a double at the left @-@ hand route .
like ch@@ anc@@ ers of Aaron Hi@@ cks came one , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cker to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted , with the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie sho@@ ots Miguel S@@ ano , who run a Two @-@ Run ro@@ gues with the ro@@ g@@ ist Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of L@@ ens and the end @-@ run on the second , Cur@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor ot@@ ters to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time that major league was leading the 27th time in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play .
after the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings a Insurance Run took over , the wall made a R@@ B@@ I double for the compilation of the ti@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed stand S@@ ano and three P@@ it@@ ches for his fifth hole .
Detroit contributed to the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the ti@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two ad@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled in the game from the po@@ aching of po@@ aching , after he had chosen more than one month because of his back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I had desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt good while I was rele@@ asing and felt that I would have some pretty good pit@@ ches that I would create in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first time , there were s@@ ush@@ es a single in Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed to get his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game for trying to get to the third , what the threat ended .
the ti@@ ers were on the second one , obtained one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; says T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not very well beaten , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es housed in a pitch @-@ count@@ ant , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the remains of the right @-@ handed by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ders .
it arrived at Hu@@ gh@@ es for three hits and a complete walk with four stri@@ k@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez was divided due to a violation of the wor@@ shi@@ pper .
he is now on the basis of Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed the San@@ chez C@@ d &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .

this diving movement is only small but nevertheless too big for a continuous heavenly body , says in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers exhibit their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was no longer known that the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ los has to give liquid water under the ice cover .

at least at the South Pole , it had to give an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed it back then .

no diet fruit - man@@ g@@ os contain a lot of sugar
man@@ g@@ os are exotic and sweet @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to take heed to his slim line , of whom will often be taken away from them .
because man@@ g@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
however , the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them contains B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ os also contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta carot@@ ene .
who eats the fruits , contributes to the muscles , the immune system and the metab@@ olic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ g@@ os should not be too soft or tight and pleasant .
the shell colour only says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so you can taste the green man@@ g@@ os very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of pure or in sweet meals .
however , a man@@ go is also a special touch .

after F@@ ier@@ end on Thursday morning , we crossed a distinctive cold front , the powerful rain accidents , wind turbines and a temperature decrease .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of St Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened a nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ hill on the name of the German reform of Re@@ forms on Wednesday .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now acknowledged as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an &quot; of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Colos@@ seum .
the name was applied by the working group of the Evangelical Church in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants were in the city of the Pop@@ es about centuries as a minority , often only in secret their faith could live .
with square in a symbolic way , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith is being welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a young August@@ inian mon@@ k in Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he emp@@ i@@ ded the city then as promised sinner .

the Luther with his thes@@ es were then initiated in the split of the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del on the split of the Dutch Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of gold ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the major works created by Ot@@ mar Alt in his entire Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and bi@@ ographi@@ cs .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now been published with magnificent paintings now .
the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations in biblical stories based on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means p@@ etty about &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the particular topics can be adjusted , which is quite dark .
at about three years , Ot@@ mar Old has worked in his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a sub@@ jective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote topics like any of the Cross , plagues , bi@@ ds , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he also fascinated spont@@ ane@@ ously the same number of partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the paintings of paintings with the respective Scri@@ ptures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ills &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ot@@ mar Old Bible stories , thus translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; summary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror by Al@@ ts painting .
they are nestled between the original scriptures of Martin Luther and each one set by the artist , who form@@ ulates his very personal thoughts on their respective situation .
the jewell@@ ery band has gold letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old enables twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
finally the trigger was the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant powers of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time the education was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ work with the Lord , perhaps , too , to carry me again with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to achieve the art in faster time again to more importance . &quot; the perception of visual worlds is min@@ ted from Rek@@ lame today , and that is no@@ isy .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is wor@@ ded .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images always mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disappear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer in the pictures , dis@@ covering and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost started on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he under@@ stands with his images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old don &apos;t have taken care of getting the Bible completely , but chose the most important topics for him , even mysterious topics .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; there was a picture of images .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both lear@@ nt ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
some of the origin@@ als - paper and fla@@ x@@ wall paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on 15 November .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans make , place found , companies engaged to model@@ ed the pe@@ face for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - yet again before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was finally finished .
they were in politics and administration for ren@@ own , especially in the inhabitants who didn &apos;t toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill moved up , new space - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission will enter in October , the first community of the Mos@@ eb@@ ach goat has now able to communicate in a child and youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year is even visible , &quot; she said .
a further commem@@ oration &quot; should be started with the work during the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga continues a clear sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of its own help in ensuring the following problems .
&quot; I think it was the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t go wrong , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in every single person to get this issue into the gras@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ CEO Wolfgang N@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to close the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the office of the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet there , State Minister , Wi@@ zo@@ j@@ u@@ z and Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; since then the theme will play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football could help and help .
the decisive turn@@ outs have to make the policy .
the German soccer league therefore has expanded his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; says Kid@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some of the Federal Government themselves support this program .
as early as this weekend , 36 pro@@ fi@@ eds will already place a clear sign when you arrive at the left Tri@@ kot@@ ni@@ mel instead of the otherwise usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) . we will help to carry # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that everyone should help and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ chief Rud@@ i Ful@@ ler the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and honored the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee &apos;s drama goes back , no one can see . &quot;
&quot; we may have soccer game , no , we must use our beam force , our influence and our ways to help many refugees that already so incredibly much to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig said from a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach recorded support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license deals would have been launched in their own projects , be magnificent .
the same is that small and smallest ver@@ eine are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we have spent is being used in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , introduces 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs usually have called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; says Kid@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP @-@ Bo@@ ats will lose an accident in case of accident
at the beginning of July , the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye to several reports , according to a fall in July .
after the accident on the stairs leading to his brother &apos;s house in the US , he has fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he carried out in his left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , he was beaten and left out of the street - this is what he told us last week , quoted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so LP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could however go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I got a lot of time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes regularly between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to happen to the public with such a personal history , the manager of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every one can happen something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to raise up again if one has fallen . &quot;

review : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : female voc@@ als in the gate
during Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group game of the European League finally proved final .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundesliga in the du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 en / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can unfortunately not use him , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ va on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ EU@@ s on Sunday in the Bundesliga match in the Bundesliga match Le@@ verk@@ usen will be open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the workout on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in light of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ nel will not only change his pedi@@ c@@ els in the R@@ EU@@ s position .
he announced a change in the position of the door@@ keepers .
therefore , Roman Weimar is taking place in the place of family art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave football @-@ teacher to the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ ee is used in all of Europe @-@ League games to use , however , Tu@@ nel let him open .
in a high probability , it will also contest the second game .
the research statement of Mit@@ er R@@ EU@@ s that the final payment for the Bv@@ B in the Europa League had to be the goal of re@@ tra@@ ctable through the game player Julian Bir@@ g@@ l for re@@ tra@@ ctable : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to sei@@ ze the title . &quot;
Ro@@ bot Gu@@ ests : government wants to press a pioneer in Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany shall be the process of the transport technology pioneer .
the Federal Cab@@ inet unanimously decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport , Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile @-@ age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was presented on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase traffic reliability , and provide for less stress , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he plans to discuss the topic even with his counterpart from the G7 states , who are also coming together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the German Ministry of Transport is under@@ st@@ ressing the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a direct access to digital radio stations .
after testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the 9 , in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the driver will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional port number on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions , and to adapt it to new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Germany wants to use it roughly globally that the permissible speed for self @-@ driving cars will be lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also aims to deplo@@ y an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car will take over the management , the driver will be more and more passenger to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that manage the environment in seconds , and process the data within seconds .
according to the study presented by the Economic Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
even haz@@ ard vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must however be clearly defined .
yet the Germans become even more sk@@ ep@@ tical , much more than French@@ man or Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA @-@ tuned survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the exam@@ ining DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans think that self @-@ driving cars will have passed over the next ten years , 32 percent are not reck@@ oned only in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respondents reck@@ on by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent of respondents .
any@@ how , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave for an auto @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital Association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to the control over the entire ride on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , there could be 15 percent present in flowing traffic , at the traffic level 45 percent .
everybody else would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo to the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German BMW R@@ iss@@ head during the EM prof@@ essor@@ ship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a blend of very large Mo@@ den@@ schau and a qu@@ int@@ in @-@ cat@@ alogs exhibition : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights include : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which , thanks to video proj@@ ections , look terrible .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who , amongst others with Mad@@ onn@@ as the stage out@@ fit , became the big star of the Mo@@ des@@ ic scene , so that he put men in the skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say no more today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was very easy , in the meantime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walks ) , it is a good luck that the Mod@@ eller has changed his first loan at the beginning of September 18th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he would have been on the other hand , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a little bit to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you arrive at the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mp@@ se of the eng@@ aging of the man , which has written the history of fashion , without ever completed a qualification .
chron@@ olog@@ ically , the watch is not built , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograph@@ ed master work that has been operated for much effort : to fr@@ ised the d@@ olls , for example a painting is involved .
14 metric tons of material have passed the m@@ acher according to the Cur@@ ator for Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather p@@ ants out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are ch@@ lau@@ er than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
the Gaul@@ t@@ ers &apos; ancient t@@ ed@@ dy is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ onal eyes of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) , dressed in his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and his clothes , he said to Gaul@@ tier .
it was not allowed to play with a doll that his parents were not allowed to him .
but the dis@@ card of fashion did he teach himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion @-@ tim@@ ings and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich first told .
but later I bought it , of course .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to cut off the clothes .

today , not even today , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ lead seats alone .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning times of pas@@ sports , fashion played a major role , then was pushed forward by the textile processing industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called a few examples : top of jewelry , for accessories like bags and regional tra@@ ps .
this is all the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , which leans feet on the Stil@@ ep@@ o@@ chen , an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in Germany in the textile industry is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .

in the last 15 years about 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private stores and business trade does not exist any more .
our products are hardly reaching the customer on this path .
the mass waste in the Asian region are now much cheaper , and almost exclusively distributed with chains .
in addition , export of export , currently to Russia and the United States .
there are enough reasons for new challenges .
the industry association is also tempted by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of nitrogen per@@ es in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we are conducting a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ olog@@ ically and soci@@ ally reliable . &quot;

diploma of U@@ te Schmidt is the head of the Grand @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to intensi@@ fy the competition from the Asian region , they have to find high quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a voltage area between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the farms that need to be economically vi@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , a existing design will often only be varied to keep a customer base .
some years ago , the textile maker Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ painted the historic snow tip .
here the machine reli@@ es on some places small cows .
the Cou@@ pl@@ eted Gold@@ schmi@@ ed Chamber of Bianca @-@ Kr@@ au@@ stri@@ a , inspired him : &quot; before , I was able to start nothing with a traditional P@@ lau@@ er tip . &quot;
now they use the sn@@ ail tip for their jewelry .
in an elab@@ orate method , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of the lau@@ dry tip - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies to the United States , to Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and want to walk a reminder .
this way I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ dry tip .

EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ors and contribute a significantly higher dose of thr@@ ottle .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch is appropriate for the appropriate employment paper in the EU , critic@@ ised their plans : &quot; risks and side effects were lack of bombing and infants , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt stated by F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt estimates the limit values of the nerve tra@@ ction should be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly charged with mercury which , on the basis of still relevant limits , would not be sold around 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be compens@@ ated .
in turn , according to F@@ ood@@ creen , the EU wants to watch the limits in other fish from currently 0,5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
however , F@@ ood@@ watch featured this as a &quot; trick &quot; for minor bugs , such as ni@@ pes usually are so low that they already hold the planned maximum values .
therefore , the absence of de@@ cel@@ ess is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ber@@ ant de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps in the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous in all in pre@@ dat@@ ors , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the Federal Government therefore warned that &quot; already small amounts may cause to cause small amounts of damage to the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced on its homepage to the applicable limit values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury will pass through the coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Green German Bundestag , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ b em@@ its more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of German em@@ itted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , war@@ nings from mercury in front of mercury in fish already accounted for the most common health risks in the EU haz@@ ard system R@@ AS@@ FF .
