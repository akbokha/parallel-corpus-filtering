for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups after the origin of its effective approach .
this does not mean that reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black on white printed label is printed in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid required liquid ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box , in which the individual vessels are located , or the containers related to the instructions : 1 complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid required liquid ,
each shipment is to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons of the group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the A @-@ An@@ tigen containing the A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate does not contain any human red blood cells that are not a A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is simultaneously dissolved in parallel , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group or an equivalent comparison of the equivalent amount of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
if the anti @-@ A serum is mixed with a same amount of 5 to 10 % water @-@ flooded with A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination should be dissolved in the double period if the same attempt is re@@ pressed , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard prepar@@ atory of the same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ odi@@ zed human red blood cells , which contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood bodies which contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is simultaneously dissolved in parallel , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ B blood group or an equivalent compar@@ ing of B blood cells .
if the anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a same amount of 5 @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must occur within the double period if the same attempt at once again dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard prepar@@ atory of same Avi@@ dity is performed .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected persons of the group 0 which can be controlled by red blood cells or specific substances in group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including the sub@@ groups A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are no human red blood cells , which contain no Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of group 0 .
it supports human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ inated in general by anti @-@ A serum samples of group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is simultaneously dissolved in parallel , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison , separated against water curr@@ ents of A1 and A2 blood cells .
in addition , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group or an equivalent compar@@ ing of B blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum is also a easily identi@@ fiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of 5- and A2 blo@@ od@@ or@@ age , so the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must occur within the double period if the same attempts at once again dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the same activity .
if anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with a same amount of 5- to 10 % water @-@ flooded by B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must occur in the double period if the same attempt is re@@ pressed , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ B blood group or a standard prepar@@ atory of the same Avi@@ dity .
an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent of blood cells with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent of blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types that distinguish themselves through the conditions , which becomes hom@@ olog@@ ous hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells .
with others , which are called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ate on obj@@ ections also homogen@@ ous red blood cells that are sha@@ ved in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements to the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly change if International standard prepar@@ atory are available ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or several people who immun@@ ised by an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not containing human red blood cells that does not contain the tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a t@@ its of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ um or equivalent comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum is according to the possibility of blood em@@ bodies , the Do @-@ An@@ tigen , react .
anti @-@ D ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50 percent dissolved in 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or several people who immun@@ ised by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with the flooded red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not containing human red blood bodies , which does not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these ser@@ a are therefore specific for the C an@@ tigen , only when the tested blood em@@ bodies are sha@@ ved in a 0,@@ 9@@ percent cooking solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tit@@ er of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ dee blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contain any form of anti @-@ D ) if they are mixed with a visible ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination of 40 to 50 percent , and the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or several people who immun@@ ised by an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; complete &quot; ) shall have a t@@ its of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not included in any form of anti @-@ D ) if they have a visible ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination of 40 to 50 percent , and ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ c and specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + e can be won directly from the blood immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the specified reaction conditions at the same time .
if the serum is intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ time of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , will not be inferior to the ant@@ agon@@ ists .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which may be immune to blood bodies or specific substances in group A .
anti @-@ A Serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood bodies , the A @-@ an@@ tigen containing A @-@ An@@ tigen containing ones of blood groups A and AB , including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are no human red blood cells that does not contain any A @-@ an@@ tigen , which is called ones of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is used in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison , separated with water curr@@ ents of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if the anti @-@ A serum is mixed with a same amount of 5 to 10 % water @-@ flooded with A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must occur in a double period if the same attempt is re@@ sol@@ dered with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood group or a standard prepar@@ atory of the same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which may be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ odi@@ zed human red blood cells , which contain B an@@ tigen , which is called ones of blood groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells that does not contain any B @-@ an@@ tigen , which is called ones of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is used in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted international standard par@@ at of the anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding comparison , with a flow of blood em@@ bodies of group B .
if an anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a same amount of 5 @-@ blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ am@@ ination must occur within the double period if the same attempt is re@@ sol@@ dered with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard prepar@@ atory of same Avi@@ dity .
