this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ction Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which , as the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , is analyzed in order to report recommendations concerning the use of the drug .
if you need more information on your disease or their treatment , please read the package action ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or apply to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that can dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ tion ( 7.5 mg / ml ) and injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mis@@ str@@ ust and del@@ ici@@ ons ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental disease , in which the patient have man@@ ic episodes altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
Ab@@ li@@ fy is used to treat medium @-@ heavier and severe episodes and prevention of medical episodes in patients who demanded the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of smo@@ oth@@ ed disorder or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to import or the melting tablet in patients who prepar@@ es tablets difficulties .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted to the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that facilitate communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lower degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine is playing a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder that contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which is reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its re@@ acts is prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was examined in three trials up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared to two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases which had been increased by a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which have been resur@@ rec@@ ted to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , which had an increased rest@@ less@@ ness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body accum@@ ulates the melting tablet and solution for inser@@ tion ( up ) .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms when patients receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms effective than placebo .
moreover , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented a placebo for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo before previously treated patients and when it was administered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms of un@@ rest and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , vom@@ iting ( sin@@ cer@@ ity ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( vom@@ iting ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( const@@ ip@@ ation production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ ing ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , as well as prevention of a new man@@ ic episode of patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of smo@@ oth@@ ie and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , when an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is the treatment of even until heavy man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proved , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has been proved .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors just@@ ify it ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ec@@ tive disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of risk of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac disease , cardi@@ ac disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
when using an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y @-@ treated patients and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ un@@ ing , the dose should be removed , reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient &apos;s signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied to patients with cr@@ amp@@ ans in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are related with cor@@ amp@@ ans in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis , were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ des or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em , or death , was reported in patients treated with atyp@@ ical psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment estim@@ ations for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical In@@ psych@@ otic active substances that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally accepted in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to coma , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain is known as side effects , and a healthy life is observed , and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines containing over @-@ related side effects as seals is taken ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is possible to expect that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore , should be made similar to dos@@ ages .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can also occur in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential health benefits should not exceed potential risks for the patient .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ list before the start of the accompanying therapy .
di@@ aph@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with an even increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 method of method@@ ological morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ om@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor when pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation regarding human being and in the re@@ productive studies on animal concerns this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is definitely the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ l@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ace@@ ae , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were treated with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long@@ time phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and on their occurr@@ ence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ill@@ ary events and increased mortality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or deliber@@ ately acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ modi@@ zo@@ l in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , however , it is un@@ likely that hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis occur in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma connection .
it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is con@@ veyed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , to the ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and to the Hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
during the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ aments , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the Put@@ amas .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study , 52 was the proportion of Respon@@ si@@ xes to study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ sk@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Deposit Fund , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study of &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with an increase in weight of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a random@@ ized efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to the lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially improved over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mono@@ therap@@ ist , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation stage before Rand@@ om@@ ization , pointing to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline in the mania &apos;s prevention .
based on in vitro @-@ studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ap@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ cy@@ mb@@ ing is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al &apos;s life is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , with Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) of the metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as demonstrated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical examination sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients no sexually dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or the effect of prey on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and strain y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different gra@@ vit@@ ae of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and el@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull down nuts on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive performance , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and a can@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data left no special dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only for dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans , so they have only limited or no importance for the clinical use .
the effects included a dos@@ ages of dos@@ ing tox@@ icity and / or par@@ ench@@ ant@@ ine @-@ cell exposure ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of human exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the amount of sul@@ fate of sul@@ fate of the hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .

it is assumed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is con@@ veyed .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study of &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with an increase in weight of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ist study about 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic was compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution to include 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form at healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 ex@@ iting was a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a result of the failure of Sul@@ ph@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ fold from the average minimum dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the medium rise of ste@@ ady at the recommended clinical dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and in@@ hal@@ ted disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be completed and started with oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to minim@@ ise the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under orbit of adi@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given dependent on an individual clinical status taking into consideration the drugs already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an additional treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the characteristics of the pharmaceutical with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot tablet or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inser@@ tion .
there are no investigations regarding the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been differently caused by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ ac@@ ep@@ ins in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme reduction or blood pressure . ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations regarding the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not prescribed for patients with alcohol or drugs ( using any plane or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cardi@@ ac disease , cardi@@ ac disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ wit@@ ches and cardiovascular dysfunction ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally accepted in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to coma , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain is known as an additional effect , and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as a mal@@ ine in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ( 15 mg dose ) and at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
105 The H2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the re@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism can also be combined with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ list before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg of dose ) in tram@@ us@@ cular , was the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined after the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral @-@ related Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % were treated with placebo .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long@@ time phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and on their occurr@@ ence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ill@@ ary events and increased mortality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution compared to statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / deteri@@ oration compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement observed from the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS @-@ Compon@@ ent scores at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but a statistical significance could be detected due to reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol study , 52 was the proportion of Respon@@ si@@ xes to study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ sk@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ cence rating scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational @-@ blind study with sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study of &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients with an average increase of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially improved over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ esc@@ ort mono@@ therap@@ ist , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension at man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed consistently regarding the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline in the mania &apos;s prevention .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after injection of the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two formulation .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was reached until reaching the maximum plasma lubrication at 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated from rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment with a system@@ ic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies on the re@@ productive treatment according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns relating to the regional exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and a can@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data left no special dangers for humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; so they have only limited or no importance for the clinical use .
the effects included a dos@@ ages of dos@@ ing tox@@ icity and / or par@@ ench@@ ant@@ ine @-@ cell exposure ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans .
in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the amount of sul@@ fate of sul@@ fate in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ keys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which is 1 to 3 times the middle ste@@ ady dose or the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously an Anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of phot@@ os@@ ane ( in sole gift and as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treat patients compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ contained medicines .
in terms of patients who have been treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines for the first time in metastatic breast cancer such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast to patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ contained medicines .
moreover , it must not be used in patients who have a quiet or before the start of the treatment low ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ hi@@ lic acid in the blood .
the committee for human@@ ist ten@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) noted that the first treatment would not be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines and that it should not be given to other drugs in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the myst@@ ique Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for the per@@ verse of myst@@ ics in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and not shown for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ hi@@ ra &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in case of sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until a improvement is reached at degrees 1 or 2 , and during all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with affecting ren@@ al function were performed and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ reflective of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be dischar@@ ged immediately , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with heavy liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly proven phot@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity was not proven in the related kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiovascular inci@@ dents are un@@ usually unusual , especially in patients with previously anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the treatment of myst@@ ic nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ r@@ he@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive funding .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used with pregnant or at women in the low age , which are not used effective receptions , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ accessible .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with myst@@ ics , a reliable prevention method apply .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , while and up to six months after the treatment there is no child .
male patients should advise prior to the treatment of a sperm conservation , because the treatment with myst@@ ic lies the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can impact on the transport and ability to serve machines .
in the following are the most common and most important events of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was rapidly reversible ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the treated patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of myst@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tose hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased blood sugar in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , genital pain , suffering pain , muscle sp@@ elling , pain in the sk@@ el@@ eton muscles , dis@@ comfort in the links , muscle weak@@ nesses very frequently :
Ru@@ hel@@ oid 1 The frequency of over@@ sensitivity inter@@ actions is calculated based on a definitive respect in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no none related to these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ active ingredient , which promotes cl@@ amping of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ul@@ indi@@ an and stabil@@ ised the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their depression .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a respir@@ ation of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies prove that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in encour@@ ages the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ tim@@ eli@@ eli@@ ft transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ ans and is due to the Albanian protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ colored studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a randomised phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mono@@ therap@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with preventive reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of myst@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ implant@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ asia .
14 % of patients had no chemotherapy alone , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ van@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for the general response rate and time up to progression free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ line therapy are placed below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity across pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who evaluated a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at the time of therapy .
the natural behaviour of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for de@@ sound on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of myst@@ ic to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of myst@@ ic with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intraven@@ ous treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide range of trav@@ trav@@ eller distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ genetic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 myst@@ ic with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent @-@ free pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent pac@@ ed pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was with Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of the human liver micro@@ some and tissue stories is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in the first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 myst@@ ic in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average dose for cum@@ ulative drain of the un@@ modified ratio of 4 % of the total dose with fewer than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a wide non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .
however , over patients aged over 75 are only a few data available , since only 3 patients participate in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ es medicines and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be careful when dealing with myst@@ ic drugs .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ al@@ ds is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur in case before the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ wage must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is shown for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make an own blood flow , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his coun@@ sel@@ ors , provided that they have received an appropriate guide .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control the treatment in order to ensure that no iron ore exists , and ice @-@ energy supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy received , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency an@@ emia or so that the body does not provide sufficient to the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in .

it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
abor@@ tion was compared to administration in a v@@ ein in the context of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either filed on se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the intervention period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
moreover , the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects were studied under the skin spec@@ kled , with the that of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia due to kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients were treated in the same degree as in those of those who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ h showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effects of se@@ wage is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ rating mig@@ rating heada@@ ches and confusion .
se@@ gregation should not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
se@@ amed as injection below the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems as additional studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that a comparable quality of quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o has achieved comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile .
the company , the se@@ dent@@ ist , will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ dic symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ences can be different depending on the age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in to more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided for a period of four weeks .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values may occasionally be observed or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the lasting hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored continuously to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ dic symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) possibly require higher conservation outlets in cases where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) possibly require higher conservation outlets in cases where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 i.e. / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ dic symptoms and - follow @-@ up effects can be different depending on the age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to reach 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored continuously to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ dic symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) , or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained from 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 g / kg once a week .

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ial defects or dust failure , it should not be exceeded under section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not di@@ aly@@ sed in terms of ren@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency .

if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ist @-@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adap@@ tion to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in participation of the respective patients , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic intervention , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the causes of an@@ a@@ emia are examined and accordingly treated .
patients who under@@ take a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic intervention should have an appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular disease , especially with an adequate cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded for treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an output equivalent value of &gt; 13 g / dl of an elevated risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / v@@ ascular events .
in several controlled trials , it was not proven for ep@@ ox@@ y that they improve survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumor growth .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have suffered a little trau@@ matic hips like those who suffered . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days of treatment ; patients with hat@@ ch@@ itis should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) of oral or inj@@ ections in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , in the three days after in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , fierce symptoms , joint pain and heada@@ ches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for z@@ om@@ eta was used for review by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and it was examined the number of verteb@@ rates and hips over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 males and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , which recently had suffered a hat@@ ches ; it was examined by the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in two studies , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in total 357 patients and compared six months with ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) .
the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase concentrations in the serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood once again decreased or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ fication ) was reduced by 70 % for a period of three years compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ fication ) , the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % compared to placebo .
in the study involving males and women with hat@@ ch@@ itis 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 out of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not to be used in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ son@@ ata or one of the other constitu@@ ents .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion place and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors that contains Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment , such as the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients who are explained to the reactions of the drug , when they should apply to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission announced the European Commission Nov@@ art@@ is Europ@@ harm Limited to approval from Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently reduced low @-@ trau@@ matic hips .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended by two or more weeks after the operational supply of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long remission period was observed in patients who demanded the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ char@@ ine or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ um vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended that limited clinical experiences would be prescribed for these patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination with older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as dates for in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ cle@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the start of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid on the bone structure a temporary , taken in symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ cris@@ y , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , for at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .

for patients who need ferti@@ lization , no data available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw zone .
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ ge Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall incidence of hop@@ ed between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted pharmac@@ ological effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney dys@@ functional z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid was associated with kidney disorders that expressed as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the alter@@ ation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in cle@@ ance ( measured by the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ ge@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ avi@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , decreased by 2.3 % of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supplem@@ entary amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical symptoms according to a hips and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical symptoms according to a recent hat@@ eful stress , vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as re@@ dness , s@@ welling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tics in the jaw field , particularly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw field ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ole@@ dr@@ onic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opor@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental agents .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw field at one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in a placebo treated with placebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to an clin@@ ically relevant mort@@ al leu@@ k@@ emia , can be achieved by the gift of a minimal amount of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was observed in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy cycl@@ ed correction or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the cabinet @-@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without the signs of an existing cycl@@ ine .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ or@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly increased over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new cycl@@ ones ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk for cycl@@ ines compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ ctions Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk for hips at 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar sp@@ un acid , hips and at the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total th@@ igh by 6.0 % , the cran@@ k@@ h@@ um by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic cre@@ st were taken .
a micro@@ computer ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ cular bone volume compared to placebo in comparison to placebo and the receiving bone mar@@ row architecture .
bone sales mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ up@@ ti@@ d of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen type ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose acet@@ ate reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly decreased by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value until 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT survey increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the tot@@ alling and clos@@ ets to all points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment was reduced by 5.4 % compared to placebo for 24 months in comparison to placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical symptoms in men ; the frequency of clinical trials was 7.5 % at Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated males compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in a different study involving males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ year administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was in comparison to the percentage change of the Len@@ inist verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D based on the percentage value after 24 months .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially mild to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ times ( specific normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ acid compared to in@@ gest@@ ion of 30 mg ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain are observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ xes at the end of the six @-@ month study ( applied on the therapy ) were able to follow up in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with acet@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate @-@ treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be maintained in 141 of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 who treated with ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate patients treated with a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data resulting in dos@@ ing independently .
after that , the plasma level quickly declined to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ asch@@ es bio @-@ phase disappearance from the big cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with an termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the elim@@ ination of the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the approved dose of urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ cle@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of interest rate concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration on time ) .
a dimin@@ ished cle@@ ance from the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme met@@ abolic systems is un@@ likely because Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ onic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans , because they are not a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent In@@ hibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

from this results in fact that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function is required up to a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ cle@@ ance to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the z@@ ole@@ dr@@ onic acid .
as for heavy ren@@ al kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute Tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ level intraven@@ ous dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients , suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , or which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more
in addition , four studies were conducted at over 7 000 patients , in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to placebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive agent for setting up the room .
for studies on setting up the smoke , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was heavily on this application area .
which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper bre@@ aches . ng The complete list of reactions reported in connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects can be found .
it may also be used in patients that suffer from an existing depression or with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among others , in a small minority of patient su@@ icides .

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse effects in plac@@ ebo@@ arding @-@ controlled trials in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and for accompanying met@@ abolic diseases .
if the incidence was statistically significantly higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng , when evalu@@ ating side effects , the following cottages are basically laid :
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very rare ( ≥ 0.01 % &lt; 0.1 % ) ;

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ction Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which will be evaluated as the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , in which the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) is analyzed to recommendations on the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medication ) can be applied together with another diabe@@ tic medication .
additionally , it can be used to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ p or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be retained at the beginning of Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better utili@@ zed and the blood sugar level is sin@@ king , enabling type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ u@@ yl har@@ p , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional treatment of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ har@@ p in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients who received Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % compared to the patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were lon@@ ging , infections of the upper bre@@ aches ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) versus Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still react in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ et@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ des ( high K@@ et@@ on@@ mirror - ac@@ id@@ sp@@ inal cord - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in part of a mon@@ otherapy ( if used ) is to be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission announced the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited granted approval to the action of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , circular , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ appropriate in which met@@ form@@ ations are in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced car@@ di@@ al reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and ede@@ ma , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular study conducted by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients under 75 years of age were performed with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and an advanced mac@@ ro@@ scope disease .
in this study an increase in reports about heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range are increased , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible once again .
if a patient has developed symptoms that indicate such a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vom@@ iting , out@@ shell problems , fatigue , appetite and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver enzymes review .
the decision whether the treatment of the patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued to be led by the clinical assessment of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir from fat deposits and related to some cases with fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitive hormon@@ al , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is considered as or@@ ale two or triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent therapy , the risk of dos@@ bin@@ ocular hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ din@@ di@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between taking of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , however , doctors should report the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patient reports about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were treated .
the calculated fra@@ gment incidence was 1.9 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medicine .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient has a pregnancy or a patient , the treatment is ab@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the analysis of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ euticals of dig@@ oxin , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker , and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to increase the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under the treatment of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on decreased hyper@@ interest in the pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the ew@@ es and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the Federal Environment Growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
they lead to a temporary change of the tower and the lens system of the lens , as well as in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the three times the upper limit of the norm range went out similar to placebo , but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ p .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ ro@@ v@@ ascular disease was the frequency of a heavy heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than to placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch has rarely been reported via con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
there was a summary analysis of un@@ wanted events of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative drugs .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of current pro@@ active study , freight rates occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine .
when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days did not occur symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to act over an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) of effect which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitive sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ eton muscles .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose monitoring in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to examine the time of therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % of the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood glucose monitoring could be defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( 8.0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ized to insulin was random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue to have insulin @-@ insulin . the group of insulin was observed in the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on group .

the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ weeks study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and mar@@ gin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol level .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one fell to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed .
in a study of over 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this is both an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac study Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ as@@ cul@@ ine disease were random@@ ized in groups that received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on quickly res@@ or@@ ates , with the top concentration of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually takes 2 hours of application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV provides efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was evaluated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
in the study , measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror , pointing out that the blood sugar level was significantly reduced with other human@@ eness .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs which may act on blood sugar ( the complete list is the pack@@ ag@@ ation method to be found ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for a approval from Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , when a fast initiated effect is w@@ ished with a longer lasting effect .
the injection pin must be used at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients , whose blood glucose monitoring has significantly improved by a intense insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( real @-@ phase , long @-@ phase insulin , human insulin or insulin @-@ analogue ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNS compared to insulin animal origin ) can result in that a change is required .
if the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is necessary for a dose of dose , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal insulin were reported , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronounced , or less than with their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals to other times .
the doctor therefore must account for potential inter@@ actions in therapy and in@@ quire after other drugs .
4 Even hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia can develop gradually : • Body hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine can be treated by the or@@ ale supply of glucose and glucose foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ sugar fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ented with consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid bul@@ son or by glucose that is given to intraven@@ ous via the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum temperature is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total length of time is up to 24 hours .

this document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ction Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which , as the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , is analyzed in order to report recommendations concerning the use of the drug .
the immediate effect of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients , possibly sensitive to insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can act on blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for an approval from Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the European Union .
if two kinds of insulin is mixed , first the amount of insulin had to be checked , then the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is necessary for a dose of dose , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals to other times .
5 General Diseases and Complaints at the administration site at the injection site during insulin therapy while insulin therapy can occur local over@@ sensitivity actions ( re@@ dness , s@@ welling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape varieties , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ sugar fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ented with consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid bul@@ son or by glucose that is given to intraven@@ ous via the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients under@@ took the mortality rate of NSC 631570 ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already have signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; stones &quot; ) . larger primitive deposits , which can lead to joint and bone damages ) .
when the urea level is still more than 6 mg per month , the dosage can be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment months , patients still may occur . therefore , it is recommended that the patients will be able to use patients at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy thre@@ er of various Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( p@@ seudo @-@ medicine ) and of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medic@@ inal drug treatment ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems receive only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ure@@ ly pur@@ ification in the blood was at 6 mg / dl under the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily dose an ur@@ inary glucose level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are heada@@ che , diar@@ r@@ he@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash , and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , possibly an increased risk of certain adverse events that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood pressure in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and the blood vessels could be seen .

liver disease During clinical studies of phase 3 were observed in the li@@ vel@@ oc@@ ities of the liver function in with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function prior to the beginning of the Feb@@ . ( see section 5.1 ) .

animal experimental studies cannot be adjusted to direct or in@@ direct harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful not to be careful in the taxes of a vehicle , supervision of machines , or the exercising of dangerous activities until they can be reason@@ ably safe to ensure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the test reported kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ ous events were observed in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term renewal studies ( 1.4 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no none associated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .

7 Open @-@ time extension studies In the open @-@ time extension studies were treated for 906 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those that were reported in phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment events were reported in all Feb@@ . treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .

action Mechan@@ ic Aci@@ d is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ met@@ abo@@ ism and arises in the framework of the reaction cas@@ cade mort@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ure@@ tic .
Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a strong , non @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with an Ki @-@ value for the in vitro inhibit@@ or , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and subjects study as below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point was in any study the proportion of patients with which the last three months of certain ser@@ um@@ per@@ n@@ acid grade is &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol to study ( bas@@ eline ) of ≤ 1.5 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ in@@ ine value to study from &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority among 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) , compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with conventional cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the impact study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in terms of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ en@@ closures &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were treated for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the serum @-@ acid brick was observed at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) during the physician visit in week 2 and maintained permanently on the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with ser@@ um@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x a day .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functional limitations The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney functional limitations ( i.e. h ) .
the primary efficacy point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there were no clinical significant differences in regard to the percentage decrease of the serum concentration of subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with heavy ren@@ al dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
in two years the data collected from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that a decrease in the incidence of serum levels decreased to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) resulting in a decrease of the incidence of tox@@ ic@@ ation ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a gyp@@ sy feed ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the tox@@ icity size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of tox@@ ins up to 24 per month .
increased t@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ time extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for f@@ ux@@ ost@@ at an increase of AU@@ C which is greater than the dos@@ ing increase .
after taking easier or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady pi@@ ady distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary engagement to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration width that reaches doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed primarily through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

the patient must take the tablet into a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or use other medicines ( including att@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the feeding tube , the patient may not take place until after the first meal recording of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not fall .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already separated from one other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the increase of vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low @-@ vitamin D mirrors were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) than for those who were solely al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate income ( 32 % ) .
moreover , the company also submitted data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are heada@@ che , pain of the system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ion apparatus such as abdominal pain , Dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( digest@@ ive problems ) , so@@ res ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , Dy@@ spher@@ ical ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ wers ) as well as aci@@ res .

the following references are precise to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not break the tablet or the tablet into the mouth because there is no risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

clinical assessment through the treated doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients may be noted that they should take the oral tablet in the next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
you should not take two tablets a day on the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day of the week@@ day .

an adult is administered adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver tran@@ spl@@ ant to prevent the tran@@ spl@@ ant of the tran@@ spl@@ ant organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation was presented , with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main inde@@ xes of the efficacy was the number of patients treated after a treatment duration from a year ( as often as a renewed tran@@ spl@@ ant or re@@ intake of the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
moreover , shorter further studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splantation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is taken in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , heada@@ che , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ alkal@@ ine ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ al ) .
in patients with post@@ erior hyper@@ sensitivity ( all@@ ergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ eyel@@ id antibiotics ( e.g. ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied to agra@@ f .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) drugs must be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f at the same time , as the advoc@@ ate dose or the dose of the simultaneously approved medication may have to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ ologic therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant @-@ intensive therapy , should ensure this drug or make changes in the immune therap@@ ative therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ants or to an increased incidence of side effects , including underwater or over@@ flow .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding dosage for daily dosage ; the formulation of the formulation or regim@@ es should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of a physician in the tran@@ splantation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ ages must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on the clinical assessment of sampling and toler@@ ability in the individual case and based on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after transition from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley level , was comparable with both formulation and also in le@@ ber@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ ance , can take a number of days before the ste@@ ady state can take place until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition are not permitted in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Treatment ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of a in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of the application for suppression of tran@@ spl@@ ants has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ splantation proph@@ yla@@ xis for tran@@ spl@@ ant therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ ages can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after tran@@ splantation .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ splantation proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant medication should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted twice daily dosage from pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , thus the change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ splantation After a change@@ over of other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ ves . once daily , treatment with the recommended initial treatment in kidney and liver tran@@ splantation is recommended for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ants .
cardi@@ ac tran@@ splantation In adult patients who are converted to an article is an oral initi@@ ation of 0.15 mg / kg / day to be taken once in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ants receivers , although there are no clinical experience with regard to lung , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ ing patients with oral initi@@ ations of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with intestinal Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces a defect of the dose required .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ en@@ in@@ in@@ insp@@ iegel , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ure@@ volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood . the dose should be based on clinical assessment of sampling and toler@@ ability in a single case under influ@@ encing of full blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirrors controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ mirrors of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes of immun@@ os@@ kel@@ intensive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low cle@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has arrived .
the data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the talents of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in full blood in the first time according to liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and for garn@@ ish and hear@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent replacement therapy of liver , kidney and tran@@ spl@@ ants were generally used blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ants or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage due to the formulation of the formulation or regim@@ es should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splantation , which proved to the other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ ves as therapy , no clinical data for standardis@@ ed formulation is still visible .
proph@@ yla@@ xis for gra@@ ft tran@@ spl@@ ants in adult heart tran@@ splant@@ ations and tran@@ spl@@ ants are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation of agra@@ phs .
because of the possible interaction which can lead to a composition of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels , the intake of vegetable preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) , or other plant bree@@ ders during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ tile concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , the chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which therefore can be found under article .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure and o@@ dem .
as with other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , sunlight should be restricted to the effect of sunlight or UV light because of suitable clothing or use of a solar control using a high protection factor .
if patients who take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of p@@ res like heada@@ che , changing consciousness state , cr@@ amps and vision , should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. , for example ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , lac@@ tose deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable medic@@ inal agents , which are known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and thus reducing the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - Blood mirror is therefore recommended to monitor the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , to monitor and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly distinctive interaction was developed with tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ica such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal compar@@ isons , results .
high @-@ do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute remedy actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in blood , or lower .
effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism would affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and to increase hormon@@ al exposure is particularly careful in decisions regarding the prevention of prevention measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a low number of investigations on tran@@ spl@@ ants do not provide evidence that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ ity res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of undes@@ irable events in relation to the process and the result of pregnancy is made .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommen@@ dable for any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( particularly in terms of its effect on the kidneys ) .
it is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ k@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the low @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va often can be detected because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other drugs .
below are the effects after their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of available data not ab@@ ass@@ able ) .

it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ icious ne@@ op@@ las@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours associated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high ties to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
active mechanism and pharmaceutical dynamic effects can be medi@@ ated by the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by his li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inn@@ s .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ or of signal transmission because of T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us re@@ pressed the activation of T @-@ cells and the formation of T @-@ cells , the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ kin@@ en ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 of the affected patients treated with 4@@ 75 patients who had subjected to a pan@@ cre@@ atic gra@@ ft and used in 630 cases as a primary immune soup .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies published the observations in the large studies , in which Pro@@ gra@@ f at liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ spl@@ ants were used for the primary immun@@ ity .
tran@@ splantation In an intermediate analysis conducted a recent trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ a in a 1 : 1 @-@ Rand@@ om@@ ization .
chronic tran@@ spl@@ ants , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed in the first year after tran@@ splantation less frequently ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ a group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
patients with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treated patients in 21.@@ 7 % of cases of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute tran@@ spl@@ ants occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the requested patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group greater ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ scription 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms with the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treated patients significantly lower .
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ splantation A multi @-@ centric study performed in 205 patients treated simultaneously with a pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney tran@@ splantation , which received a random@@ ized process of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then transported to the targeted talents of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal tran@@ splantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study involving oral gra@@ gra@@ fts showed 155 patients ( 65 only Dar@@ m , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al tran@@ spl@@ ants ) in Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the screening of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mark@@ er , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ists , lower starting outlets from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , lead to Tal@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application will be addressed to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscle or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but it is named after a method which is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) was placed in which they are capable of the formation of the human being factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different medicines in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is similar to differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ sep@@ tic acid had been rated &quot; or &quot; well &quot; evaluated .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , heada@@ che , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ inn@@ itus factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to approval for the In@@ transport of Adv@@ ate in the European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitu@@ tions are determined according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ defect , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity is supposed to fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of patients passed .
during treatment there is an appropriate dose and frequency of inj@@ ections an adequate provision of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ iegel .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ values .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis for patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not to be reached or if the blood flow with an appropriate dose does not have to be accomplished , a test must be carried out if necessary for a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures have to be filled .
the rate of administration should be applied after the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ins , which is quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re @-@ occur of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients who have higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , heada@@ che ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data not ab@@ ass@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated from the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculations . b ) The unexpected waste of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ Spiegel@@ s entered post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was observed during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed a sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnose heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed up a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , the 53 pa@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavier to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) of a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE for inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immun@@ ity of patients on traces of contam@@ inated prot@@ ein was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody tit@@ res against this protein , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell . however , there were no signs or symptoms resulting in an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ er Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes was reported in several repeated product texts as part of the study .

the activated factor VIII works as a co@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated factor IX , and accelerates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the initial approval data , CH@@ MP grants the benefit of risk @-@ risk assessment as a positive rating , but in consideration that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE that requires a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval lover should apply to another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited divided the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes his application for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
normally , the breast , the brain , the bone , or the crossover components ( tissue , connecting other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and reli@@ es ) of it .
it is a kind of virus that gene@@ tically modified so it can bear a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which has been changed in fact that there is no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can trigger affected by humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and enable the cancer cells to form normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body @-@ contained p@@ 53 gene , usually carries a recovery of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA is not restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work correctly , and the cancer cells continue to grow and share .
the company was based on data from a study involving a patient suffering from the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the under@@ mining , in the bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP had examined the answers from the company to which the questions asked , some questions were un@@ explained .
based on the evaluation of the initially submitted documents the CH@@ MP on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP view , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors was given benefits to the patient .
the committee also concerns concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in may be established in reliable way , and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient .
the company appointed CH@@ MP not knowing whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ o @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are thus composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ ylo@@ graphy , caused by all@@ ergy to poll@@ en @-@ mu@@ c@@ ous inflammation of the nose ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ welling ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the s@@ welling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be found on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms that were reported from the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients contributed their symptoms all 12 hours into a diary and evaluated using a standard scale , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the loc@@ ust symptoms , the patients reported Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze income , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.9 % compared to patients who were p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone .
if only the s@@ welling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to patients who des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ ers ( cardi@@ ac fluids ) , harmon@@ i@@ bility , di@@ zz@@ iness , heada@@ che , heada@@ ches , heada@@ che , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ol@@ ence ( ins@@ om@@ nia ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( dro@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be sensitive to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin ( another drug for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) , cannot be applied .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , or already caused a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain blood ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval for the In@@ transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , it is to be swallowed in the whole ( i.e. without taking them to break or cut ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied for children under the age of 12 due to the absence of fail@@ ures and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued with the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can take away .
after the s@@ welling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper bre@@ aths , treatment may be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , the medicine is also con@@ dens@@ ate in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with other v@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ els such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ lid , erg@@ ot@@ amine , erg@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ st@@ iv@@ a , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as remote sho@@ res of the rhin@@ oc@@ ytes ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ haz@@ ard , n@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) .
security and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dose .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , cardi@@ ac disease , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as heada@@ che or an ampli@@ fication of heada@@ ches ) must be removed .
in treating the following patient groups : patients under D@@ IG@@ IT@@ AL@@ IS • Pati@@ ents with cardi@@ ac disease • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder , bladder or bronze ch@@ aps in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying out of der@@ mat@@ ological tests as Anti@@ hist@@ amine has otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or in their dimension .
in the frame of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , with which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition , there were no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo was diagnosed with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was not yet identified , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ conc@@ ord@@ ability of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities occur in comparison to the frequency of normal population .
since re@@ productive studies in animals should not always be transferred to humans , and for the reason of v@@ aso@@ con@@ stric@@ tors of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied , that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms vary between a CN@@ S depression ( Se@@ as , Ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart disease collapse ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ kking , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ es .

a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ iness , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ard rigid and - Dil@@ at@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ ult P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement capacities of the flight power , including the rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective beats or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was determined compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ d or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ amine faced efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall scores for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a s@@ welling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pills with regard to the s@@ welling effect , determines the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a s@@ welling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ cher was badly affected .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , was the exposure of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not recognize any special dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the effects observed were generally speaking with the content of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin .
in re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen .
in March 2007 and module 1.@@ 8.1 the application for the application described pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ anz@@ system is established and works , before and whilst the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ amine contribute to the line of allergic symptoms by preventing that hist@@ amine , a body @-@ own substance , can un@@ fold its effect .

for children ages one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ an .
for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup bz@@ an .
in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in days ) and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to im@@ itate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to import and melting tablet in the same way as the tablets and the use of children un@@ imagin@@ able .
in an allergic rhin@@ itis when the results of all studies were taken into consideration , the twenty @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us were evaluated by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two trials in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symp@@ tom@@ y was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us cannot be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to approval from A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for the effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease and may be terminated after the sound of the symptoms and at their re @-@ occur .
in persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the all@@ ergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , with which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study at simultaneous taking of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not ampli@@ fied the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied , that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were more common than in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ iness ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ che ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse events occurred at 5.9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and in 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ ult P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in a single dos@@ ing study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement capacities of the flight power , including the rein@@ forcement of sub@@ jective beats or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the line of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ment and re@@ dness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as on the basis of the total score of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduce the burden of rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ op@@ hysi@@ ology is similar to the equivalent of path@@ ology in various forms and chronic patients can be recruited easier pro@@ spective .
as the hist@@ ological occupation of a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin except for the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria also leads to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidance .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of squares in the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti @-@ hist@@ amine with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not respond to Anti@@ hist@@ amine from the study .
improvement of the growth rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis @-@ population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no aging points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was not yet identified , so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ thal@@ ates , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical trials performed in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in relation to the tox@@ icity film of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot recognize any special dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ption physician should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data should be found that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and respective laboratory and skin investigations should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have met@@ abo@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and experienced a higher sub@@ stress load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup among children aged between 2 and 11 years , is identical to you , is identical to the children that met@@ abolic normally .
this drug contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inher@@ ent problems of a fru@@ c@@ tose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or suc@@ rose @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , with which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study at simultaneous taking of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not ampli@@ fied the most efficient effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , which were administered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals showed itself .
in clinical trials , at recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was determined compared to placebo .

the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tablet revealed that this formulation is an un@@ likely risk for local irrit@@ ations at clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , who have to use , is identical to the children that met@@ abolic normally .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of a fru@@ c@@ tar int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or suc@@ rose bub@@ ble @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken .
the overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group similar to the placebo group .
in children aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events that were reported more frequently than in placebo , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and ins@@ om@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study involving a single dose of 2.5 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution for inser@@ tion no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years were observed .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see under section 5.2 ) in the child and adult population .
in clinical trials , at recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was determined compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis , depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis .
as on the basis of the total score of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us pills effectively reduce the burden of seasonal rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect flu caused by strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of influenza that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new trunk of influenza is di@@ visible , which can easily spread from humans , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the immune system contained in the vaccine as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms an antibody against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a flu virus of this stem .
afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus has been separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which det@@ ects human body as body @-@ strange ) , clean and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for evaluation of the safety of the vaccine , in order to comply with the requirements of the guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
should you participate in clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your treated doctor .
if you wish further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years associated with human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ generic bladder should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al drugs of the patient before , and the probability have assessed that the virus will speak to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .

in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount is reduced in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS does not cure , however , the damage of the immune system , and thus far , the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases are free .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , however , without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors .

the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after the treatment .

in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger drop of the viral load after four weeks in the patients receiving their existing prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are heada@@ che , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ r@@ he@@ a ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash , and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ leg@@ ase may not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ id@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ generic bladder may also not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a plant preparations for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are being dismant@@ led as aspir@@ ated and harmful to high concentrations in blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ a , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation of syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the immune system ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ generic bladder is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outstanding circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited granted approval for the transport of A@@ chem@@ ase in the entire European Union .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually a@@ generic capsules of the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ ic Boo@@ kings of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resist@@ or and the occurr@@ ence of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are applied without the rein@@ forcement of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ kings ) , higher doses have to be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ generic bladder is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data the dose of A@@ generic capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function distur@@ ban@@ ces to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be exposed to patients with lighter or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ trained ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generic bladder can not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be pointed out that act or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the healing of the HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ generic bladder prevents the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually a@@ generic capsules are to be applied together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver inter@@ actions with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information in this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including a chron@@ ically active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ a and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , which is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the side function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the formation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ generic bladder may be less effective because of reduced plasma samples ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for os@@ pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity in accordance with the high propylene gly@@ col , this formulation of children under an age of four years is con@@ tra @-@ trained and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ generic bladder should be reset to duration 5 if a rash occurs from system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an ex@@ az@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with medication which are associated with the development of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with cancer .
in h@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ectors , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
in the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , in the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ atic reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical resist@@ ors or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fact@@ orial Ä@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immune system , higher body mass index ) , in particular cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates can not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with a low therapeutic A@@ gener@@ on@@ avi@@ r can not be used together with medicines whose substances are mainly related via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , which are primarily associated with severe plasma and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ ro@@ rolog@@ ical failure and can result in a resistance of resistance .
during the attempt to compens@@ ate the plasma glucose levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable effects were observed at the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) The serum levels of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be dissolved by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) .
if a patient can already take Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ t mirror , and , if possible , check the Vir@@ us@@ load and retri@@ eve the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ot@@ er@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max level by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
when Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma was achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a close supervision that is not recommended because the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the anta@@ stic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and car@@ cin@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore there is no dose adjustment in combination with amp@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with eman@@ ating in@@ ence in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or would be min@@ ate .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine to other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be noted that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , beware because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of reducing or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma glucose levels .
if this medicine is used together , caution is commanded ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as a precise forec@@ asting of the combination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase of plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thus resulted in an increase in related side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , gi@@ ve@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ generic bladder can be used to reduce the dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data should be found .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with aspects in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma level of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on the 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , among them including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can lead to inter@@ actions together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with a@@ generic .
based on the data of other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ as can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va which are known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower level of plasma bars of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ odi@@ pine , p@@ addle @-@ pin , ni@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ th@@ pin , ni@@ th@@ pin , ni@@ th@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by 10 by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
simultaneous taking of A@@ gener@@ ase , plasma concentrations may increase considerably and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ations , visual dysfunction and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study carried out in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these Glu@@ k@@ oc@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ t , unless the possible use of a treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism depends heavily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the elim@@ ination of plasma bars are expected at the same time of as@@ generic administration .
because plasma controls of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can result in my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
it will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of mirrors , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same gift of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while with the same application of A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ections indicate a possible increase of plasma bars of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ fa@@ ks .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for os@@ pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of its low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given as the Am@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is given if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
for simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generic bladder , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a depreciation or gain of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not projected , therefore also alternative methods for receiving contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the same gift of A@@ generic bladder ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after pregnancy for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
however , in the milk lak@@ es@@ ome rats , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r occurs in breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the influence in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight loss .
the further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ity and re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r on the womb .
the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated for adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the related side effects related side effects were slightly up to moder@@ ately , occurred early and led to treatment in treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they are used in connection with the taking of A@@ gener@@ a or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects originate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors did not previously treated patients 1200 mg A@@ generic bladder twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as under the treatment of applied laboratory studies ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ iri@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hy of breasts and dor@@ al fat tissue ( stal@@ act@@ ness ) .

the connection between the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in human beings is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r curved treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
at sixteen years of 434 anti@@ retro@@ ents did not receive patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otype .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure within the 59 included , with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance samples , similar to those with adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ rology failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests , Gen@@ otyp@@ ical Inter@@ pret@@ ations can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M together with a reduced phenomen@@ al resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ eli@@ hood of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to modifications by additional data , and it is recommended to move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyze the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations , phen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data to estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests , have clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four , with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns , a certain cruci@@ resist@@ ence against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ ectively patients with which an Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ men ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to the isol@@ ates .
the early break of a vers@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which may result in the subsequent treatment .
the cover of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , combined with PI ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ sid@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with the lowest of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in regard to the previous year @-@ adjusted average ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ le@@ ct shaft of 0,4 @-@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of untreated a@@ generic aspect is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ generic solution for inser@@ tion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of those with PI pre @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value .
19 Based on this data should be considered for the treatment of treatment with PI @-@ treated children who are considered to be the expected benefit of &quot; invisible &quot; A@@ generic bladder .
after oral dos@@ ing the median duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is about 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blo@@ od@@ stream in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the concentration of active concentration in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ id@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ interrupted Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dos@@ ing concentration of the ste@@ ady concentration in the ste@@ ady concentration of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that represent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or sub@@ strate or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ l@@ able than of the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generic solution and A@@ generic intake are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
also the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al disorder on the elim@@ ination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schem@@ atics lead to Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma screens comparable to that of healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ icity with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats competed in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ omas on people who were suffering from 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ular Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas was not resolved and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for human beings is un@@ clear .
from the present ex@@ positions data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients was observed , neither during the administration of A@@ chem@@ ase , after the end of the treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and with am@@ id@@ avi@@ r treated animals a high mortality .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposure that was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage during humans , however , a number of minor changes were observed , including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ el@@ ab@@ normal@@ ities , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are applied without the rein@@ forcement of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ kings ) , higher doses have to be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ generic capsules amounts to 20 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be exposed to patients with weak or lighter liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ trained ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active concentration .
A@@ generic bladder should be reset on duration 27 if a rash occurs from system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to an vi@@ ro@@ rolog@@ ical failure and can result in a resistance of resistance .
508 % increased , for C@@ max level by 30 % , when R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma was achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there is a close supervision that is not recommended because the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
treatment with eman@@ ating in@@ ence in combination with Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or would be min@@ ate .
if this medicine is used together , caution is commanded ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be carried out as a precise forec@@ asting of the combination of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , gi@@ ve@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ generic bladder , the dosage is to be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data should be found .

in a clinical study carried out in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
for simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ generic bladder , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a depreciation or gain of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after pregnancy for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the im@@ itation in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding period of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the decline .
the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated for adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient can be observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures required .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell@@ ular lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is active in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates ; the receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the benefit of treatment with PI @-@ treated children should be considered the expected benefit of &quot; invisible &quot; A@@ generic bladder . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ interrupted Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dos@@ ing concentration of the ste@@ ady concentration in the ste@@ ady concentration of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that represent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or sub@@ strate or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generic ( see section 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible and therefore the effect of a ren@@ al interference caused by the elim@@ ination of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the taking of the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .

in addition , there must be no dose for simultaneous application of a@@ generic solution for inser@@ tion and low do@@ si@@ ated R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided with these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for use , an application of a@@ generic solution for entry in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high @-@ term propylene gly@@ col , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for entry in children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competent in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug , which may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects like cardi@@ ac disease ( z ) .
the patients should be pointed out that act or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the healing of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with A@@ chem@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .

in these patients there should be eff@@ ected between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and with a potential loss of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients there should be eff@@ ected between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and with a possible organ shock or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction @-@ related risk .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ auth@@ orization has been carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is were observed , and one case was observed with one of the circumcision .
in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) in rare cases were observed severe local skin irrit@@ ation , which led a treatment required and / or have led to a temporary impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ur@@ inary tube , some women had difficulties in water that required a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of affected area .
in connection to the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous funds for the treatment of external F@@ eig@@ n in the genital and peri@@ odic range there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data suggest an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ n reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elim@@ ination of the b@@ ular war@@ es however .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od inside 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or hair inser@@ tion was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of this reaction decreases in general during therapy or reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the re@@ generation of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
currently no data on long term healing rates are available from over 36 months after the treatment , in case of super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma other suitable therapy forms should be pulled out .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated b@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences yet , therefore the application of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute Ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose , or the ears , or on the li@@ pp@@ age range within the lip .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute Ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ic areas outside the fac@@ ial and the scal@@ p area .
the available data on the acute not@@ at@@ osis to the fore@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness of this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally take effect in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions have great dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be exposed to a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ companies gain a lower full rate of healing than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

the most frequently shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to adverse events in the studies of three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of the treatment of F@@ eig@@ n ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
most frequently reported , possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection , were in this studies a reaction on the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects , which were reported by 252 in placebo controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute Ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below .
these according to study included assessment of clinical signs indicates that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently used to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / sheets / to@@ bs ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
these according to study included assessment of clinical signs indicates that in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common in these studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very frequently to severe ery@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ oms ( 13 % ) , and severe pain education ( 19 % ) .
clinical studies on the investigation of the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis was as@@ pe@@ z@@ ie with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the extraordinary unique recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , heada@@ che , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe adverse effects , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
following the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od an increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alp@@ ha@@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected in the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 appro@@ vals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete expression of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a full conclusion could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies with the dos@@ ages there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum by the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml on the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 bag ) and in the hands / poor ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated closing time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; that refers to an extended re@@ tention of the drug in the skin .
data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of age and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the paint tox@@ icity at the rat no . doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a four @-@ month study on the paint application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study for car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at the administration of three days a week had no tum@@ ors at the use of the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption of human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk for people because of the system@@ ic exposure than very small .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be sensitive to patients who react strongly ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year all new information , which may review and update such summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is treated patients who observe al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission adopted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .

treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ent met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient rate this , every 15 minutes in single steps may be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as each in connection with in@@ fusion , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be monitored continuously , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ launch facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually found , usually within 3 months from treatment course begins .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , because of the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) , to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of slight or medium @-@ severe reaction , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be reduced and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
the in@@ fusion can be taken up again with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred again .
3 are ( Anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ ca@@ in , because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cell intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow to direct or in@@ direct harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data in new@@ bor@@ ns , who were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the breast milk , it is recommended to feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted medical actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the phase 3 study and their renewal in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older , are frequently listed in the following table following the following capacity : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper bre@@ aths and l@@ ungs in the pre@@ history , heavy reactions came out , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ ic , respiratory failure and fac@@ ial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted medical effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were reported during a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy so@@ unding form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment to a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ o , whereas in the patients at the age of 5 years with a heavy flow rate ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until simultaneous ex@@ crete from the study ) was det@@ ectable with 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients , in which it had never arrived at Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ o .
patients with missing to a low @-@ body mirror reveals a robust reduction in G@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti @-@ body tit@@ ers could be a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing natural effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be found in connection with the incidence of undes@@ ired drug actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse reactions were typically dropped with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and the preventing a further accumulation of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely over Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients showed the mean phen@@ otype and only a patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited when they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute line in the 6 @-@ minute salary test .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the anticipated FE@@ V in this period is not significant and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased more than proportional to the body @-@ size of the children .
of 26 patients with a Hep@@ atomic nu@@ is@@ alie reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ ag @-@ mirrors in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was found , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients , the clin@@ ically significant changes has been taken into account in the 6 @-@ minute salary test , in general improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were under the age of 5 ( 16 patients with heavy so@@ unding form and 4 with the middle class form ) .
in four patients the dosage due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in Har@@ n was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ run form , a normal spiritual development speed , whereas in the older patients with heavy so@@ unding form only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were performed on the dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ atics on the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute salary test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent patients , the difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , represent a representative alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ atics is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by the elderly and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in unique gift , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot recognize any special dangers for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used along with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) if the cancer can &apos;t be removed ( drugs against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( drugs against cancer can be found ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) can already be found on other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that att@@ acking not the record epith@@ el@@ ium cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have previously not been treated with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously treated other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies than all@@ al therapy .
to reduce side effects , the patients should be taken with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition to or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally an &quot; anti @-@ e@@ tical &quot; ( Medic@@ ines against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be decreased , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ft in a main study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study involving 5@@ 71 patients were treated with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients suffering from A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in were treated at an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients who were unable to attack the epith@@ el@@ ium cells in which the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta was prolonged periods of survival compared to the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be charged with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the blood bottle and diluted with 0,9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
a reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment as well as the day after the treatment of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ h , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to obtain in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third control cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins , a complete blood image should be created prior to every treatment , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ess .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of Dos@@ age must take place under the occasion of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the fore@@ seen therapy cycles .
after the recovery , the patients must be treated according to the tables in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood flow .
patients non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity in grade 3 should develop ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ atology tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increased side effects of an increased risk factor exists .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ cle@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients recommended dose custom@@ iz@@ ations .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in cle@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver functional limitations of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper leg value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with ab@@ duction of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not specifically studied in the studies .
patients have to be monitored with regard to the bone mark@@ edly and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ hi@@ lic count once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ sy count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ous treated patients have to be used to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tic measure to reduce un@@ conditional tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency ( N@@ SA@@ IDS ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is necessary to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ams ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular area , a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent is supposed to be wo@@ ken before the P@@ em@@ etic treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ atory events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this drug was usually administered in combination with an other cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed li@@ mp@@ s ( excluding yellow fever , this vaccination is con@@ tra @-@ controlled ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible fo@@ rest@@ ation of the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - G@@ inn , advice on the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oids ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed de@@ position with the result of a multiplied cause of side effects lead .
therefore , caution is offered when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ cle@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDS or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ ylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - ( see section 4.4 ) .
as there are no data regarding interest potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time interval such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of barley status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ la@@ stic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient &apos;s du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed during pregnant women , but as in an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected for an application in pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless necessary , and after careful ab@@ duction of the working for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment start , advice on the sperm change @-@ out .
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk and un@@ wanted effects on the un@@ wanted infants cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) versus the sole Cis@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms flows through an improvement of lung function in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of control .
a multic@@ enter , randomised , open phase III study involving AL@@ IM@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of hist@@ ology in the treatment effect on the overall survival was observed in favour of patients with NSC@@ LC in favour of NSC@@ LC ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately randomised , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analysis of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of the AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ plat@@ in combination across the gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ plat@@ in combination .

chemical therap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
Chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 from 185 ) .
compared to Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these figures were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with severely em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids by adding one before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rec@@ tal age , patients with am@@ nesty compensation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us are monitored according to the injection of eng@@ m@@ esh@@ ed .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , it is advis@@ able to extend the same treatment of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or the extension to such an extension .
in the context of chemotherapy alone , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used to treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after receiving chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical trials hem@@ med Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron detected against tum@@ ours of the five examined Chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , chlor@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ eri@@ r , nit@@ rate and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies cannot be applied , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary from the treated doctor .
clinical studies were the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ che ( 9 % ) and hom@@ eli@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions at the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing expertise .
in the group with the highest dose the similar dose of adverse events were observed , such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ drug relations .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective treatment with a alo@@ xi@@ ation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients were treated with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ o intraven@@ ous .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , patients receiving 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron received 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of clinical @-@ based chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the policy channels of the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved , and extend the duration of the promotion .
the objective of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. and administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration of a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ating time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in general in the entire dos@@ ages range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in visions and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average mean ( ± SD ) increase in pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration is 42 ± 34 % .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical sim@@ ulations indicate that during a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days , total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved comparable value after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the amount of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have compared to pall@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 have been involved in the metabolism of the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron found approximately 80 % of the dose found in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was found as an un@@ altered substance for about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous fix@@ ture , the overall physical activity was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time and the average system@@ ic exposition with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after exposure , which are considered adequate for the maximum of human exposure , which indicates a small relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 Some clinical trials showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block up only in very high concentrations of ion channels that can extend to the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ) were given in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , tri@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses and da Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low as for people .
the holder of this auth@@ orization for the In@@ transport must inform the European Commission on the placing on the subject of this decision approved in the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the provision of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should be similar to a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same path@@ ogenic components that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long and persistent ) Hepatitis C ( one by virus infection ) .
during a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue damage damage , in addition , values of the liver enzymes in al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by an yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was placed , which stim@@ ulates the formation of the effect .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon contributed data to determine the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
patients with hepatitis C was compared to the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon with the effectiveness of reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus at blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Author@@ ised for non business days . what were the greatest concerns that caused the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendation to reconc@@ ile approval ?
in addition , concerns increased because of the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market@@ able pharmac@@ euticals have not been sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that were on treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon infl@@ amed the disease in more patients than with the reference point ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more effects .
apart from that , the study included in the study test for the investigation of the question of how far the medicine forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficient vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) and small in@@ fest@@ ed In@@ dic@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pped ) , bend dic@@ als and wires .
Al@@ tar@@ go shall not be used for the treatment of infections which have been proven by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because alarm against this kind of infections may not affect this kind of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , the surface area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should re @-@ examine the patient and drag alternative treatments .
it works by block@@ ades of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacteria ) in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ an indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was observed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo said to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in were observed in a similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together at skin care , about 90 % of the patients were treated in the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ awa ( eit@@ er@@ ated hollow spaces in the body tissue ) or of infections which have been proven by MR@@ SA , which is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
the Committee for Human Reg@@ ard@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections occur towards the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ings , ob@@ struc@@ tions or wires .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. for approval from Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
the patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be demonstrated once more and an alternative therapy will be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sensiti@@ zation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is abandoned , the oint@@ ment should be carefully caught and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections where MR@@ SA is known or assumed ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary @-@ infected wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ itis in patients with infections which caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered when after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to its low plasma concentration which have been achieved on human skin , or infected superf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant Hem@@ p is not to be expected in vi@@ vo ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times daily , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the dic@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to its low system@@ ic exposition of top@@ ical use in patients , dose custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required for treatment if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive distribution of oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement of effects on the birth and the feder@@ ate / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
in case of decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / terminated , between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the su@@ cking child and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go were used , the most frequently reported adverse events at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
active Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis of the bacter@@ i@@ ellen of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the connection of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
due to binding to this binding point , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ bra@@ ti@@ line the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer to block some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub @-@ units .
due to the local prevalence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some Inf@@ ection forms should be informed about experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates are sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non@@ respon@@ sive to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ance factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was raised 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be a day under Ok@@ klu@@ sion to intact and put on the skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were won .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake on humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % Sal@@ be s@@ me@@ sted to 200 cm2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirts .
met@@ abolic Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , among small participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation .
neither in male nor female rats signs of reduced Fer@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , reducing one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 the dic@@ ed skin ) :
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study in rats were observed at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development st@@ icity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ fication ) and subsequent tox@@ icity .

ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is applied in the frame of one of two doses existing , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that one can be led out of two doses of existing vaccines required .
if a final dose of hepatitis A or B can be desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine is given .
vaccines have in effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; strange &quot; and antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the registered vaccine Twin@@ rix adult and the Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ inations are applied to protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one of three doses existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as proof for the application of ambient temperature .
the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
ambient temperature between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protective ambi@@ ence of ambient temperature was similar in a sixth and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of ambient temperature ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are heada@@ che , he@@ et deficiency , pain on the injection site , re@@ dness , matter ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not respond to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) will not be used .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a approval for the In@@ transport of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standardis@@ ed plan for basic equi@@ pping with ambient temperature is made of two vaccine doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six months and twelve months .
if a collection bag is required for hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination imp@@ etus .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies observed in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
it is not completely secured whether immun@@ ity individuals who are demanded on an Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , as they are also protected as protection , as they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory by immune memory .
3 As for the rare cases of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended to the combination of the hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with interference from the immune system , no anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody being achieved , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses can be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular dos@@ ing could result in a sub@@ optimum stim@@ ulus , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie or blood cl@@ inn@@ itus , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the shape of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined mas@@ on@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , was the response response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients under immun@@ ologic therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is generated .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccine doses of adults , the frequency of pain , re@@ dness , s@@ welling , mat@@ ologists , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , heada@@ che and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ an@@ - and preserv@@ ative in@@ hal@@ ent vaccines .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccines were administered at the ambient temperature of 10@@ 27 imp@@ ot@@ ers at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of ambient temperature was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination .
only exceptions were the higher skins of pain and matter on a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambient temperature , but not based on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the treatment of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the test subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the treatment of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination .
according to the complete vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who received the ambient temperature was administered over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ory was comparable high ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the ambient temperature , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % compared to the subjects , which received the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing method ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and so@@ id was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine scheme .
in a comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ old imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the occurr@@ ence of local actions and general actions in the ambient temperature was comparable to the hepatitis C virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , with the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per sample , reports .
the share of imp@@ fl@@ ingen , which reported over heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination , with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units . in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was not statistically significant .
in clinical trials which were conducted at imp@@ fl@@ ingen during the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparable study which was conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses of ambient rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose nutri@@ ent significantly higher than with ambient temperature .
the response , which were achieved in a clinical study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , reached a month after the completion of the full vaccines series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the imp@@ ot@@ ers received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccines with ambient temperature or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units . in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of floor di@@ vin@@ ation ranged from 12 to 15 years , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immun@@ re@@ action against both anti@@ gens was comparable to both antibodies after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination mold , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other way , as by bathing waters contam@@ inated through waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ anium , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms which may be a stationary treatment .
as for all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can protect not completely from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus from the administration of both vaccine doses or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccine can not prevent any disease .
a protection against other infections which cause the liver damage or symptoms that are similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by ju@@ ck@@ eting skin supplements , respiratory failure or s@@ orting of the fac@@ ial or the tongue . • If with you / your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • When you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
in a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambient temperature .
instead , he will advise you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C virus ( 360 ELISA units of a formal@@ in activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ inations of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine before the termination of the vaccination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix comes with people who are inj@@ ected in heavy bleeding problems , under the skin and not inj@@ ected in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or a treatment in your own body defense , or if you / your child moves to a hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the response of these persons on the vaccine can not be sufficient , so a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction on the vaccination is .
21 If you take your doctor if you receive / your child further medicines / enter ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without dis@@ agreement ) or if you have vacc@@ inated your child before / or Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given or that in the near future is planned .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is given at the same time with ambient rix , should be vacc@@ inated to separate places and possible different limb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix is at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ort@@ lob@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women are not given , except it is ur@@ gently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second impulse , please contact your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 imp@@ imp@@ ed cans ) : • pain or complaints at the inclusion of pain or re@@ dness • mat@@ ure@@ ability • heada@@ che • App@@ et@@ it@@ deficiency

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the opening of the first approval for the In@@ per@@ missions , the CH@@ MP occurred the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix is only placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug may be limited due to its low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzymes or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) .
ammon@@ ium is divided - split into several single doses at meals , mixed with food mixed or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ der ( through the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a nose @-@ probe ( by the nose into the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
there was no comparable study , because ammon@@ ium cannot be compared to other treatment or placebo ( a hypo@@ aller@@ gies , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium is also able to reduce loss of moisture content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , heada@@ che , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid or taste version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin rash or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the end that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with interference from the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium values .
ammon@@ ium has been approved by &quot; unusual circumstances &quot; due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the application is indicated in all patients , with which a complete enzyme already manifested in the new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ lasting form ( in@@ complete enzyme defective , which is manifest after the first life of life ) an indication of the use when An@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ rec@@ tile Dys@@ function AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in granite .
the daily dose is individually calculated into account of protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manipul@@ ated lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ rist@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ rist@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets must not be given patients with si@@ p disorders , as a risk for the formation of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not reach immediately into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) , sodium per 20 g of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium re@@ flux and ede@@ mic formation only with caution can be applied .
because metabol@@ isation and de@@ position of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the meaning of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ trained ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate in young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
in a delay , matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ alen syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted if Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is divor@@ ced in breast milk , and this is why the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not in connection with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old ano@@ dis@@ ischen female patient , which developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ un@@ break@@ able en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old small child with an extraordinary single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active connection which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
phen@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxi@@ des ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the removal of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with interference from the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of recorded sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen are produced .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the forecast of the earliest symptoms of the disease was almost always infectious disease , and the disease led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog computing within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen de@@ formation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to diagnose the survival rate of neu@@ tered disorders ( however within the first life month ) to increase ill@@ nesses to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy during the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical deficit .
in patients with a late @-@ clinical form of the condition ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , re@@ covering from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , and subsequently treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is born .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in wet healthy adults and patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were found .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is det@@ ectable in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in the plasma level was five times higher than after the first gifts .
the drug will be ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans were not en@@ lighten@@ ed effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low up tablets or patients with si@@ p disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ver or a Nas@@ ens@@ probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with an adult and adult .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , Car@@ nit@@ ine and Ser@@ um@@ prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manipul@@ ated lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ rist@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ ir@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat in front of the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) were exposed to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the Hir@@ n@@ rin@@ de .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old ano@@ dis@@ ischen female patient , which developed a met@@ abolic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ un@@ break@@ able en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ t@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
phen@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxi@@ des ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the removal of excess weight .
on the basis of investigations on the elim@@ ination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with interference from the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that each gram of recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0,12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
already existing neuro@@ logic defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after intake meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration were detected by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the final product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
with this approach , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring sco@@ op . 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medicine about a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes require certain liver enzymes so that they can not ex@@ crete the stu@@ ffs of protein in the body after the consumption of proteins .
in case of laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken if it is not prescri@@ ption drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding time , you are not able to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may be over@@ taking into the milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ence , heada@@ ches , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , re@@ tention of the ear , des@@ ori@@ enti@@ ousness , memory dysfunction and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately rely on your doctor or with the emergency recording of your hospital for purpose in connection with an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

an@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example , at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest @-@ cor@@ k with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ing &quot; ( abnormal value for electro@@ cardi@@ ograph or EK@@ G ) .
when an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with anxiety or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the traditional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and an GP@@ I .
while the PCI was frequently a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they received another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - during preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days and one year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ subjected a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than Hep@@ arin .
an@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ estones or other components .
it cannot be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox on the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval from An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) in case of emergency access or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous charge of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in other sequence a PCI should be given an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion of the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI in clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a dispens@@ ing of 0.5 mg / kg is supposed to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of these intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second layer should be charged 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney functional limitations ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that can be subjected to a PCI ( whether using Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower rate of rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT once again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which led to approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adap@@ tion at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 If patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis cases , angi@@ ox is con@@ tra @-@ trained ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be directed 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous treatment of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Dutch Hep@@ arin .
• a well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other blood pressure or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • Active bleeding or hyper@@ tension disorders . • heavier un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial irrit@@ ation . • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sed patients
patients are carefully monitoring during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood flow , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients appear under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most of blood cells in arter@@ ial point levels , in patients receiving a per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) can occur during the treatment of principle everywhere .
in patients who are treated War@@ far@@ in and with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be treated , an monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be observed in order to ensure that the value after removal of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will be reached before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ants or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in parameters in any case regularly .
the animal experiments are related to the effects of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see under Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in those with Hep@@ arin was treated for women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding have been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measurements for heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding also occurred at Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone compared to the groups of Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known blood pressure , Re@@ operation due to a blood supply , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood locations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; misc . &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ th@@ ic , ears , nose and neck .
the following data on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6,000 patients who under@@ go a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in Group as well as in those with Hep@@ arin was treated for women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding also occurred less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less often than in the comparative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system classes in table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in immediately break down and the patient can closely monitor a blood flow with regard to signs of blood .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ o@@ or , which bin@@ ds both in the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the A@@ ni@@ otic @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the engagement from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ iting the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , with serum of patients who had come to h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ie / h@@ ep@@ ar@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , was not induced .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in represents a dos@@ ing and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is used by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention at 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , an un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ synchron@@ ized syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B also were random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent Isch@@ a@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased kar@@ di@@ ale biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of patients under@@ gone a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four and triple @-@ end points of a random@@ ized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients receiving a PCI ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients requested limited information about the application of angi@@ ox on patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in were evaluated in patients who subjected to per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in as Pep@@ tide is a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acids with subsequent recovery of amino acids in the body @-@ pool .
the primary met@@ abo@@ lit , resulting from the split of the Arg@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through th@@ ru@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of his aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
the elim@@ ination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a process first order with an termin@@ ale half @-@ time of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , or re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not recognize any special dangers for humans .
tox@@ icity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10 @-@ Fa@@ er@@ ase of clinical pl@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ological effects .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regul@@ ate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood , or insulin is not effective .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter times as a short @-@ effective human@@ eness .
A@@ pi@@ dra was tested in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in one study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , with the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ an indicator for the efficacy was to change the concentration of substance gly@@ c@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal levels .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can act on the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal pain@@ s or the delta angle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection through continuous in@@ fusion within the range of abdominal bags .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin level , the insulin requires reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any changes to the effectiveness of the brand ( her@@ e@@ ers ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin demand .
3 An in@@ adequate dose or demol@@ ition of a treatment , especially in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ des ; these conditions are potentially life threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be stored under str@@ ingent supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia depends on the impact profile of the insulin formation and can therefore change to change the treatment schem@@ atic .
to the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the ti@@ lt of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , an@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , mono@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ics , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effect of symp@@ a@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ting , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ches must be weaker or missing .
animal experimental studies on the re@@ productive therapy showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ins and human@@ eness in relation to the pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if insulin is over@@ taking into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , yet it is res@@ orted to oral use .
listed below are the cases of clinical studies listed , group@@ ed by system classes and ordered after decl@@ ining incidence of adv@@ ances ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available ba@@ it data not ab@@ ass@@ able ) .

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection range , can occur in the result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ roph@@ y at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ented with consciousness can be given by a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an intraven@@ ous person or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ ism projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify and avoid similar episodes for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the peripheral glucose consumption ( especially due to sk@@ el@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous st@@ ion in the effect of insulin occurs faster and effective duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal levels .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melan@@ oma , insulin @-@ relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose level of glu@@ ed effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a sub@@ proportional increase of the glu@@ ed impact effect , exactly as human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human@@ ess and achieved the full glu@@ ed effect effect about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ism .
from the data was deliber@@ ately that during an application of Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin was placed in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ale control was given as with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if the insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 tablespoons before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at the gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison with human beings , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - downstream ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to human@@ kind , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
