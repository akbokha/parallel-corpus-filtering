<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Beurction Report (EPAR) in which, as the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP), is analyzed in order to report recommendations concerning the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information on your disease or their treatment, please read the package action (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish further information on the basis of the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that can dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for insertion (7.5 mg / ml) and injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), misstrust and delicions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental disease, in which the patient have manic episodes alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ablify is used to treat medium-heavier and severe episodes and prevention of medical episodes in patients who demanded the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of smoothed disorder or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to import or the melting tablet in patients who prepares tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted to the same time as Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that facilitate communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lower degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamine is playing a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which is reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and its reacts is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was examined in three trials up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared to two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which had been increased by a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which have been resurrected to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, which had an increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the patient was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body accumulates the melting tablet and solution for insertion (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms when patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, Abilify prevented a placebo for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo before previously treated patients and when it was administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms of unrest and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), vomiting (sincerity), vomiting, Nausea (vomiting), fatigue and exhaustion (constipation production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insoming (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in Bipolar-I disturbance, as well as prevention of a new manic episode of patients who were predominantly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of smoothie and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance, when an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is the treatment of even until heavy manic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proved, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has been proved.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify it (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of risk of Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiac disease (myocardial infarction, cardiac disease, cardiac disease, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure sensitive drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there was occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">When using an ABILIFY-treated patients and symptoms of late dyskuning, the dose should be removed, reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient's signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be applied to patients with crampans in the anamnese or at states that are related with corampans in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis, were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovasculine events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazides or hyperosmolarem, or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical psychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment estimations for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical Inpsychotic active substances that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored in terms of deterioration of the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally accepted in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manie due to coma, the use of antipsychotics, with which weight gain is known as side effects, and a healthy life is observed, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central medicines containing over-related side effects as seals is taken (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, although this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is possible to expect that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore, should be made similar to dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">In the CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism, the joint application with high-effective inhibitors of the CYP3A4 can also occur in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol as a comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential health benefits should not exceed potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protector inhibitors, might have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosishlist before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diaphazem or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with an even increase in the Aripigezol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3 method of methodological morphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethomorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor when pregnant or pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation regarding human being and in the reproductive studies on animal concerns this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is definitely the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parlonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinaceae, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol Treatment and 13.1% were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at bipolar-I disturbance - in a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed with patients under Aripiprazol Treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the longtime phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between patients groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol. compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and on their occurrence with Aripiprazol, the malignant neuroleptosis syndrome, late dyskillary events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberately acute overdose with Aripiprazol alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information about the effectiveness of a hemmodizol in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol, however, it is unlikely that hemmodialysis occur in the treatment of an overdose of benefits as Aripiprazol has a high plasma connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to the Dopamine D4, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenches and to the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">During the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers showed a dosisdependent reduction in the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligaments, on Nucleus caudatus and on the Putamas.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks), Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol study, 52 was the proportion of Responsixes to study medication, similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messskals, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Deposit Fund, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study of 'weight gain' was significantly less patients with an increase in weight of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed a randomized efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapist study of 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychological characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a compared to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to the lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially improved over 2 weeks not on lithium or valproat monotherapist, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients treated with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation stage before Randomization, pointing to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar retreat, mainly in the prevention of a bipolar decline in the mania's prevention.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyapulation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealcymbing is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal's life is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol, with Extensive Metabolism on CYP2D6 and for nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") of the metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as demonstrated in pharmacokinetical examination schizophrenic patients no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no reference to clinically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or the effect of prey on pharmacokinetic by Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and strain ydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney insufficiency in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different gravitae of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and elydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to pull down nuts on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive performance, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and a canogenic potential, the preclinical data left no special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only for dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans, so they have only limited or no importance for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dosages of dosing toxicity and / or parenchantine-cell exposure (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponding to 10 times the mean Steady state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of human exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was found as a result of the amount of sulfate of sulfate of the hydroxy- Metabolites from Aripiprazol in the Galle of Monkeys after repeated treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human genall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulfate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol no more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of Monkeys were found, and lie far below the limits (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold of the medium rise of steady at the recommended clinical dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">To minimise the resorption and minimize the variability, an injection in the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus-maximus muscle is recommended under orbit of adious regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given dependent on an individual clinical status taking into consideration the drugs already used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an additional treatment with Aripiprazol is indexed, see the summary of the characteristics of the pharmaceutical with ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY hot tablet or ABILIFY solution for insertion.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations regarding the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with agitivity and behavioural disorders that have been differently caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar-I disorder.</seg>

<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was compared to the sole gift of Aripiprazol, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) was used as a maline intramuscular (15 mg dose) and at the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the reorption rate of Aripiprazol, although this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In comparison to CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolism can also be combined with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripivzol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- Protective inhibitors, could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosishlist before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral-related Aripiprazol as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13,1% were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% was in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the longtime phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol Treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between patients groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agitivity and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding agility and behavioural disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement observed from the output value on the PANSS-Component scores at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agitivity, a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed, but a statistical significance could be detected due to reduced patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks), Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol study, 52 was the proportion of Responsixes to study medication, similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>

<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34% in Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a Olanzapin-controlled, multinational-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study of 'weight gain' was significantly less patients with an average increase of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg in an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially improved over 2 weeks not on lithium or valescort monotherapist, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension at manic patients treated with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase, Aripiprazol showed consistently regarding the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a bipolar decline in the mania's prevention.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% bigger in the first 2 hours after injection of the same dose as tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulation.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was reached until reaching the maximum plasma lubrication at 1 to 3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was tolerated from rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated treatment with a systemic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>

<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for security harmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and a canogenic potential, the preclinical data left no special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans; so they have only limited or no importance for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dosages of dosing toxicity and / or parenchantine-cell exposure (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponding to 10 times the middle steady state-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a Cholelithiasis was found as a result of the amount of sulfate of sulfate in the Galle of Monkeys after repeated oral treatment of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (which is 1 to 3 times the middle steady dose or the 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubuli-active ingredient, which promotes clamping of microtubules from the Tubulindian and stabilised the microtubuli by inhibiting their depression.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a respiration of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vitational interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediates the transzytosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies prove that the presence of Albumin encourages the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transentimelielift transport through the gp-60-Albans and is due to the Albanian protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Beurction Report (EPAR), which will be evaluated as the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP), in which the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) is analyzed to recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) can be applied together with another diabetic medication.</seg>
<seg id="751">Additionally, it can be used to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylharp or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylharnant or insulin can be retained at the beginning of Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulfonylharnant or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better utilized and the blood sugar level is sinking, enabling type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphuyl harp, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glykosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value which suggests that blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional treatment of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphuylharp in a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin, a decrease of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% compared to the patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were longing, infections of the upper breaches (cold), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) versus Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still react in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetetic ketoazides (high Ketonmirror - acidspinal cord - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in part of a monotherapy (if used) is to be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission announced the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited granted approval to the action of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, circular, curved and wear on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inappropriate in which metformations are inappropriate (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For application of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardial reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and edema, if pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular study conducted by Pioglitazon patients under 75 years of age were performed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and an advanced macroscope disease.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study an increase in reports about heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors up to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range are increased, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible once again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient has developed symptoms that indicate such a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, outshell problems, fatigue, appetite and / or dark harn, are the liver enzymes review.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patients with pioglitazon should be continued to be led by the clinical assessment of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dosisdependent weight gain was detected, which can stir from fat deposits and related to some cases with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction in medium hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparatively controlled trials with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitive hormonal, the pioglitazone is considered as orale two or triple combination therapy with insulin-dependent therapy, the risk of dosbinocular hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thiazoldindions, including Pioglitazon, on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between taking of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, however, doctors should report the possibility of a macular edema when patient reports about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon were treated.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fragment incidence was 1.9 Fraktures per 100 patient years with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractions per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 Fraktures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient has a pregnancy or a patient, the treatment is abated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the analysis of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceuticals of digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, Cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker, and HMGCoA reduction inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC of Pioglitazon to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon (cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC of pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under the treatment of Pioglitazon decreased hyperinterest in the pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the ewes and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the Federal Environment Growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">They lead to a temporary change of the tower and the lens system of the lens, as well as in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon the three times the upper limit of the norm range went out similar to placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylharp.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease was the frequency of a heavy heart failure under pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than to placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported via congestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of unwanted events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative drugs.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of current proactive study, freight rates occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day after seven days did not occur symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to act over an activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ) of effect which leads to an increased insulin-sensitive sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose monitoring in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued for two years to examine the time of therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% of the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy, a blood glucose monitoring could be defined as HbA1c (8.0%) by Pioglitazon in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomized to insulin was randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazon reduced the middle HbA1c - value by 0.45% compared to the patients who continue to have insulin-insulin. the group of insulin was observed in the Pioglitazon group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotify comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-weeks study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels and marginally, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone fell to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, while under Metformin and Gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks Pioglitazon did not only reduce the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this is both an effect on the triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiac study Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macroasculine disease were randomized in groups that received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon quickly resorates, with the top concentration of unaltered pioglitazon in plasma usually takes 2 hours of application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV provides efficacy in about three times the effectiveness of pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical costing of digoxin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or with rifampicin (cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the barrels (55%) and refound at a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The medium plasma-elimination time of unaltered pioglitazon amounts to humans 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rationality of the oral cleance of the parent.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration. plasma-magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversible of eccentric cardiac trophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under the treatment of Pioglitazon, it is diminished in the formation of hyperinsulanemia and increased insulin resistance of the womb and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the Federal Environment Growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family-adenoids polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazoldinions led to an increased frequency of colontres.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fragment incidence was 1.9 Fraktures per 100 patient years with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractions per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 Fraktures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, with pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotify comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks Pioglitazon did not only reduce the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this is both via a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing in terms of their primary endpoint, a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, strokes, acute coronarisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, put the results that with the intake of pioglitazon are not associated with cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of unwanted events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon, showed up an increased incidence of bone quarries in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 Fraktures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was evaluated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycemylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease of the HbA1c-mirror, pointing out that the blood sugar level was significantly reduced with other humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During clinical studies of phase 3 were observed in the livelocities of the liver function in with Febuxostat treated patients (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function prior to the beginning of the Feb. (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas not performed ineffective studies to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibiting may lead to an increase in the theophylline (a inhibiting of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">The simultaneous gift of Febuxostat and Naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Febuxostatic exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors were not related to clinical significant increase of undesired events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with colchicin or indometacin, without that a dose adaptation for Febuxostat or the same other active substance is required.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily showed a medium 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak senic effect of Febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide contains the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and caused a decline of Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy Data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies cannot be placed on side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or health of the foetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies cannot be adjusted to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful not to be careful in the taxes of a vehicle, supervision of machines, or the exercising of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably safe to ensure that ADENURIC does not affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the test reported kardiovascularious events were observed in the Pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term renewal studies (1.4 versus 0,7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no none associated with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinical significant differences in regard to the percentage decrease of the serum concentration of subjects, regardless of their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with heavy renal dysfunction).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serumharnacid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40% of patients (baseline) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">In two years the data collected from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that a decrease in the incidence of serum levels decreased to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulting in a decrease of the incidence of toxication (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gypsy feed).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of the toxicity size, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of toxins up to 24 per month.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased tSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open-time extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration is easier and multipler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for fuxostat an increase of AUC which is greater than the dosing increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking easier or multipler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax amounts to approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration, if this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1231">In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are formed primarily through CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C8 or CYP2C8 or CYP2C8, and that Febuxostatic glucuronide is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marker Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose occurred in the urine (3%), whose well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metastases (3%).</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, the gift of oral prednison (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically significant change in oral bio availability (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Alendronat is distributed after intravenous treatment of 1 mg / kg temporarily in Weichteilings, but then rapidly distributed in the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">3. after intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronat, about 50% of the radioactive substance was divorced in 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the barrels.</seg>
<seg id="1330">According to intravenous treatment of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal cleance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic cleance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronat is not excreted by acidic or basal transport system of the kidneys, and therefore it is not thought to be influenced by human drugs through this transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">The exploitation of radioactivity in vitamin D3 with healthy volunteers was the mean decrease of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4%, in the barrels after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients preclinical studies have shown that the percentage of alendronate, which is not shifted in the bone, will be eliminated quickly beyond the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is pre-contained, it is possible to calculate that renal elimination of alendronate as in the animals are also reduced with reduced kidney function in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, in patients with reduced kidney function, a somewhat elevated cumulation of alendronate is expected to be expected in the bone (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunologic therapy and treatment of transplant-intensive therapy, should ensure this drug or make changes in the immune therapative therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, it can lead to transplants or to an increased incidence of side effects, including underwater or overflow.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding dosage for daily dosage; the formulation of the formulation or regimes should only be carried out under the engaging control of a physician in the transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosages must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based on the clinical assessment of sampling and tolerability in the individual case and based on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After transition from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talmirror should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systemic exposure, measured as a valley level, was comparable with both formulation and also in lebertransplant patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Talmirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation, to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate aftertransplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of sereninininspiegel, a calculation of the creatinine and monitoring of the urevolume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to the conversion of a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see section 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the valley mirror in full blood. the dose should be based on clinical assessment of sampling and tolerability in a single case under influencing of full blood-Tacrolimus-Talmirrors controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus Talmirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talmirrors of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosisadaption, changes of immunoskelintensive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low cleance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the steady state has arrived.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level should not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the talents of Tacrolimus lie in full blood in the first time according to liver transplants usually in the range from 5 - 20 ng / ml and for garnish and hearted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent replacement therapy of liver, kidney and transplants were generally used blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe adverse events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage due to the formulation of the formulation or regimes should only be carried out under the engaging control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplantation, which proved to the other immunosressives as therapy, no clinical data for standardised formulation is still visible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis for graft transplants in adult heart transplantations and transplants are still no clinical data for the retardant formulation of agraphs.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of the possible interaction which can lead to a composition of the Tacrolimus levels, the intake of vegetable preparations, the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated), or other plant breeders during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tactile concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, the chamber or septum hypertrophy was observed under Prograf, which therefore can be found under article.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders, are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, liquid exposure and odem.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosressiva, sunlight should be restricted to the effect of sunlight or UV light because of suitable clothing or use of a solar control using a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or vegetable medicinal agents, which are known as Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can increase the metabolism of Tacrolimus, and thus reducing the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, the Tacrolimus- Blood mirror is therefore recommended to monitor the CYP3A's metabolism, to monitor and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1455">Effects of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs of Tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism would affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reduce the clearing of steroid contraceptives and to increase hormonal exposure is particularly careful in decisions regarding the prevention of prevention measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially reduce the cleance of pentobarbital and phenazon and extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of investigations on transplants do not provide evidence that under Tacrolimus compared to other immunity ressiva, an increased risk of undesirable events in relation to the process and the result of pregnancy is made.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application will be addressed to whether Advate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscle or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but it is named after a method which is called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell where a gene (DNA) was placed in which they are capable of the formation of the human being factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different medicines in the European Union called Recombinate, but is similar to differently, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood-septic acid had been rated "or" well "evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies compared to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against human clinnitus factor VIII, mouse or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to approval for the Intransport of Advate in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitutions are determined according to the severity of factor VIII-defect, after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity is supposed to fall under the specified plasma level (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of patients passed.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment there is an appropriate dose and frequency of injections an adequate provision of factor VIII-Plasmaspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and have different half-values.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis for patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not to be reached or if the blood flow with an appropriate dose does not have to be accomplished, a test must be carried out if necessary for a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective, so other therapeutic measures have to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be applied after the patient, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG Immortlobins, which is quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modifying Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 expositions is the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnetically known inhibitors, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the re-occur of (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who had previously untreated patients who have higher risk for the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (1 / 10,000), very rare (frequency based on the available data not abassable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated from the sum of the individual patients (234) calculations. b) The unexpected waste of blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels entered postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in one patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood coagulation was observed during the whole time and both the factor VIII- mirrors in plasma as well as the Clearance Rate showed a sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnose heavy to moderate hemophilia A (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed up a low inhibitors (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>

<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients, 5 out of 25 (20%) were treated with ADVATE for inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immunity of patients on traces of contaminated protein was analyzed by the investigation of the antibody titres against this protein, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the anti-Cho cell. however, there were no signs or symptoms resulting in an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval data, CHMP grants the benefit of risk-risk assessment as a positive rating, but in consideration that the safety profile should be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP is based on the basis of safety profile of ADVATE that requires a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the approval lover should apply to another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited divided the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) officially that the company takes his application for approval from Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, the breast, the brain, the bone, or the crossover components (tissue, connecting other structures in the body, surrounds and relies) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that genetically modified so it can bear a gene into the body's cells.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been changed in fact that there is no copies of themselves, and therefore no infections can trigger affected by humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumours and enable the cancer cells to form normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defect in the human body-contained p53 gene, usually carries a recovery of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA is not restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-cancer, with which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work correctly, and the cancer cells continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company was based on data from a study involving a patient suffering from the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the undermining, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP had examined the answers from the company to which the questions asked, some questions were unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initially submitted documents the CHMP on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP view, the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors was given benefits to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin may be established in reliable way, and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company appointed CHMP not knowing whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or "Compassio-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed active release" "" "means that the tablets are thus composed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is released over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (haylography, caused by allergy to pollen-mucous inflammation of the nose) in patients with nasal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes of the severity of the hypocrisy symptoms that were reported from the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients contributed their symptoms all 12 hours into a diary and evaluated using a standard scale, how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the locust symptoms, the patients reported Aerinaze income, over a decrease of symptoms by 46,0%, compared to 35.9% compared to patients who were pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a decrease of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% compared to patients who desloratine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycarers (cardiac fluids), harmonibility, dizziness, headache, headaches, headache, fatigue, insomolence (insomnia), Somnolenz (droplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be sensitive to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adrenal agents or Loratadadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies), cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a bottlenangle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension), cardiac disease (hypertension), or already caused a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain blood) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval for the Intransport of Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, it is to be swallowed in the whole (i.e. without taking them to break or cut).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied for children under the age of 12 due to the absence of failures and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued with the sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can take away.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes of the mucous membranes in the upper breaths, treatment may be continued with Desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrin, the medicine is also condensate in patients who are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity with other vseudoepheels such as Bromocripitine, Pergolid, ergotamine, ergydroergotamine or other deonstiva, the peroral or nasal as remote shores of the rhinocytes (phenylpropanamine, phenylephrine, ephazard, nhazard etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Security and the effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective, and the data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerobaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data are not sufficient to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">The patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or tachycarcinoma, cardiac disease, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or an amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In treating the following patient groups: patients under DIGITALIS • Patients with cardiac disease • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, bladder or bronze chaps in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before carrying out of dermatological tests as Antihistamine has otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or in their dimension.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the frame of clinical trials with Desloratadine, with which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition, there were no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences between the desloratadine and the placebo was diagnosed with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin was not yet identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconcordability of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities occur in comparison to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies in animals should not always be transferred to humans, and for the reason of vasoconstrictors of pseudoephedrin, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified, that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms vary between a CNS depression (Seas, Apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart disease collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, trekking, convulsions) with possible letes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, values Miction, muscle weaknesses and increased muscle tension, Euphoria, arousy, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, astaxia, tinnitus, hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin typical symptoms (mouthiness, pupillard rigid and - Dilatation, bonding, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the Adult P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement capacities of the flight power, including the reinforcement of subjective beats or the tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg. daily, no increased frequency of drowsiness was determined compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympaimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycard or manifestations of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamine faced efficacy of aerobaze tablets, determined by the overall scores for the symptomatic (except for nasal mucosa swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin in the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze pills with regard to the swelling effect, determines the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study to pharmacokinetics of aerobaze is Desloratadin detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow-weight of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrin was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, was found that four subjects Desloratcher was badly affected.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin, according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrin, was the exposure of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety spharmacology, for toxicity in repetitive gift, for genotoxicity and to reproductive Toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desloratadin does not recognize any special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as their individual components, and the effects observed were generally speaking with the content of pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-stoological studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin, in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogen.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and module 1.8.1 the application for the application described pharmacovigilanzsystem is established and works, before and whilst the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamine contribute to the line of allergic symptoms by preventing that histamine, a body-own substance, can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze pills lens symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal rhinitis (hastats), such as Niesen, running or jucketing nose and tanging eyes with simultaneous constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1722">In a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies on patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance in days) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to imitate that the body uses the syrup, the solution to import and melting tablet in the same way as the tablets and the use of children unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In an allergic rhinitis when the results of all studies were taken into consideration, the twenty-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius were evaluated by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials in Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptomy was after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius cannot be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval to approval from Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical trials for the effectiveness in the application of Desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the previous disease and may be terminated after the sound of the symptoms and at their re-occur.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy time.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, with which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study at simultaneous taking of Aerius and alcohol is not amplified the most efficient effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should be clarified, that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to an impairment of traffic light or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were more common than in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouthiness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse events occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratine and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg desloratadin (nine-time clinical dose), no clinical-relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the Adult P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses, in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovasculature effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosing study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement capacities of the flight power, including the reinforcement of subjective beats or the tasks that are connected to the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the line of symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, lacriment and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As on the basis of the total score of the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduce the burden of rhinitis caused by seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of Urtikaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the equivalent of pathology in various forms and chronic patients can be recruited easier prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histological occupation of a causal factor in all urtikarial diseases is expected that Desloratadin except for the chronic idiopathic urticaria also leads to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidance.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improvement of Pruritus and the number of squares in the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with anti-histamine with chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not respond to Antihistamine from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the growth rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients with Desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to assess these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhinitis-population, a higher concentration of desloratadine was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no aging points for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin was not yet identified, so that interaction with other drugs will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratine inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetthalates, calorie rich breakfast) does not apply to the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials performed in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in relation to the toxicity film of Desloratadin and of Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity in repeated treatment, genotoxicity and for reproductive Toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin cannot recognize any special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, roasted wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data should be found that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of the anamnese, physical investigations and respective laboratory and skin investigations should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have metaboise desloratine and experienced a higher substress load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup among children aged between 2 and 11 years, is identical to you, is identical to the children that metabolic normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherent problems of a fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or sucrose-insufficiency of this medication should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, with which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect flu caused by strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of influenza that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepandemie breaks out when a new trunk of influenza is divisible, which can easily spread from humans, because people still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the immune system contained in the vaccine as "body-alien" and forms an antibody against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a flu virus of this stem.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membranes of the virus has been separated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface which detects human body as body-strange), clean and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for evaluation of the safety of the vaccine, in order to comply with the requirements of the guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenera, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immunreactivation of syndroms (symptoms of infection that are caused by the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenera in combination with other antiretroviral medicines in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Ageneric bladder is usually taken along with the pharmacokinic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefits of Agenera in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protector inhibitor is not proven.</seg>

<seg id="1927">For usually ageneric capsules of the pharmacokinic Bookings of Amonavir are administered together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amonavir should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistor and the occurrence of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amonavir as a solution for entry is 14% less than one capsule; therefore, Ageneric capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for ageneric capsules is 600 mg of Amonavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase Capsules are applied without the reinforcement of Ritonavir (Bookings), higher doses have to be applied (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for ageneric capsules amounts to 20 mg Amonavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amonavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenera in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protector inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneric bladder is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the failure of data to inconceivable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetical data the dose of Ageneric capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disturbances to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be exposed to patients with lighter or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-trained (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements, the Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amonavir during taking Amonavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be pointed out that act or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to the healing of the HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportunist infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Ageneric bladder prevents the risk of transferring HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually ageneric capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer chronic hepatitis B or C with an antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information in this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including a chronically active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenera and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other Glukokortikoids, which is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroids effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the side function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the formation of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor of CYP3A4 is dependent, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Ageneric bladder may be less effective because of reduced plasma samples (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amonavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva can be changed, however, the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given at the same time with Amonavir, patients should therefore be monitored for ospiracy symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="1957">In the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), in the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop a inflamatic reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunist infections which leads to severe clinical resistors or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a Multifactorial Ätiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immune system, higher body mass index), in particular cases of osteonecrose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates can not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also substrates substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic Ageneronavir can not be used together with medicines whose substances are mainly related via CYP2D6, which are primarily associated with severe plasma and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin caused an 82% reduction in AUC of Amonavir, which can lead to an virorological failure and can result in a resistance of resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1962">During the attempt to compensate the plasma glucose levels by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often undesirable effects were observed at the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated) The serum levels of Amonavir can be dissolved by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with Johanniskraut (hypericum perforated).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient can already take Johanniskraut, the Amonavirt mirror, and, if possible, check the Virusload and retrieve the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amonavir (see also Eoterenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax level by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amonavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Amonavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and inconceivable of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">When Amonavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amonavir in plasma was achieved twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amonavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amonavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there is a close supervision that is not recommended because the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanosene in combination with didanosin, but is recommended because of the antastic component of Didanosin, however, that the revenue of didanosine and carcinase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore there is no dose adjustment in combination with ampavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with emanating inence in combination with Amonavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protector inhibitor would be minate.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine to other protector inhibitor and existing limited data can be noted that Nevirapine possibly lowers the serum concentration of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used simultaneously, beware because Delavirdin may be less effective because of reducing or possibly subtherapeutic plasma glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medicine is used together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise forecasting of the combination of Amonavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amonavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase of plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin at 193% and thus resulted in an increase in related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, giveutin together with Ageneric bladder can be used to reduce the dose of rift in at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data should be found.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aspects in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma level of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole on the 2.69times compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, among them including substrates, Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can lead to interactions together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions, which are associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with ageneric.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protector inhibitor, it is advisable that Antazias can not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulva which are known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amonavir can lead to a lower level of plasma bars of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, diodipine, paddle-pin, niodipine, nithpin, nithpin, nithpin and Verapamil may be increased by 10 by Amonavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous taking of Agenerase, plasma concentrations may increase considerably and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotations, visual dysfunction and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study carried out in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily), while endogenous Kortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% reduction intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Ageneronavir is not recommended with these Glukocortikot, unless the possible use of a treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism depends heavily by CYP3A4, the elimination of plasma bars are expected at the same time of asgeneric administration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma controls of this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can result in myopathy including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of mirrors, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at the same gift of Amonavir. (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with oral Midazolam (see section 4.3) while with the same application of Ageneric Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protections indicate a possible increase of plasma bars of Midazolam around 3 to 4-faks.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon is administered together with Amonavir, patients should therefore be monitored for ospiracy symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of its low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given as the Amonavir- dose is given if Amonavir is administered at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Ageneric bladder, an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a depreciation or gain of antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not projected, therefore also alternative methods for receiving contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the same gift of Ageneric bladder (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after pregnancy for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">However, in the milk lakesome rats, Amonavir-related substances were detected, however, it is not known if Amonavir occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the influence in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period of Amonavir, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including Fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Amonavir on the womb.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The inconceivable of Agenera was investigated for adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the related side effects related side effects were slightly up to moderately, occurred early and led to treatment in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified if they are used in connection with the taking of Agenera or another at the same time for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects originate from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protector inhibitors did not previously treated patients 1200 mg Ageneric bladder twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigator as in connection with the study medication, were performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as under the treatment of applied laboratory studies (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fairial fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and doral fat tissue (stalactness).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretrospants not previously treated with ampivudin / Zidovudin combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin was treated over a medium term of 36 weeks (&lt; 1%).</seg>

<seg id="2016">Amonavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the processes of viral gag- and Gag-pol- polyproteinous levels with the result of a formation impackers, non-infectious viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amonavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both acute and chronic lymphoblast cellular lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Amonavir is active in the area of 0.012 to 0,08 µM with acute infected cells and 0,41 µM in chronic-infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amonavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication in human beings is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir doses have been observed - as with other Ritonavir curved treatment schemas with protector inhibitors - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen years of 434 antiretroents did not receive patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred until week 48, with 14 isolates genotype.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, with a virological failure within the 59 included, with protector inhibitors not previously treated patients showed resistance samples, similar to those with adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protector inhibitors occurred in patients with virology failure over 96 weeks, the following protector inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance tests, Genotypical Interpretations can be applied to the estimation of the activity of Amonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protector inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance than the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / G, I84V and L90M together with a reduced phenomenal resistance to Fosamprenavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to modifications by additional data, and it is recommended to move the current interpretations to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypical interpretations, phenotypical interpretations can be used in conjunction with genotypical data to estimation of the activity of Amonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protector inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests, have clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four, with reduced sensitivity to Amonavir associated genetic patterns, a certain cruciresistence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistant between Amonavir and other protector inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistors, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretrospectively patients with which an Fosampavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saaviavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insmen) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amonavir reserves its activity against some other protector inhibitor resistant isolates; the receiving of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations to the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early break of a versing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits, which may result in the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the efficacy of Ageneronavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, combined with PI (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidavir (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with the lowest of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity compared to Agenerase, at least one another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI Group in regard to the previous year-adjusted average (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sublect shaft of 0,4-10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of untreated ageneric aspect is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children between the ages of 2 and 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Ageneric solution for insertion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose of Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of those with PI pre-treated patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients included in the study included plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered for the treatment of treatment with PI-treated children who are considered to be the expected benefit of "invisible" Ageneric bladder.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing the median duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amonavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax, reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amonavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amonavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amonavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is about 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of Amonavir from the bloodstream in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the concentration of active concentration in plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amidavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of uninterrupted Amonavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing concentration of the steady concentration in the steady concentration of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that represent CYP3A4 inducing or inhibits or substrate or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution when they are given simultaneously with Ageneric (see section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amonavir exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amonavir is made of the solution 14% less bioverlable than of the capsules; therefore, Ageneric solution and Ageneric intake are not interchangeable on a milligrammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal disorder on the elimination of amidavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schematics lead to Amonavir plasma screens comparable to that of healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amonavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for canogenicity with Amonavir on mice and rats competed in male animals benigne hepatocellular Adenomas on people who were suffering from 2.0 times (mice) or 3.8- (rat) of exposure to humans, according to twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular Adenomas and carcinomas was not resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present expositions data on humans, both from clinical trials as well as from therapeutic application, however, there is little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (ames test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test on human peripheral lymphocytes, was Amonavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (by its effect in relation to lowering the Gag-concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme found the Gag-concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver in the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, osteropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycards (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is treated patients who observe aldurazyme as regards the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission adopted Genzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammals (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative for the long-term enzyme of patients with secured diagnosis of a sample-accharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place through a physician, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherent metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient rate this, every 15 minutes in single steps may be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as each in connection with infusion, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be monitored continuously, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment in which relaunch facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against laronidase are usually found, usually within 3 months from treatment course begins.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with Aldurazyme using Aldurazyme (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, because of the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antihistamine and / or antipylock), to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of slight or medium-severe reaction, treatment with anti-histamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be reduced and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-induced reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, treatment with anti-histamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be taken up again with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred again.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (Antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with the intracell intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data in newborns, who were exposed to laronidase via the breast milk, it is recommended to feed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical trials were classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medical actions in connection with Aldurazyme that were observed during the phase 3 study and their renewal in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older, are frequently listed in the following table following the following capacity: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper breaths and lungs in the prehistory, heavy reactions came out, including bronchospic, respiratory failure and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted medical effects related to Aldurazyme associated with Aldurazyme that were reported during a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with mainly heavy sounding form and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients occurred within 3 months after the start of treatment to a Serokono, whereas in the patients at the age of 5 years with a heavy flow rate (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until simultaneous excrete from the study) was detectable with 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients, in which it had never arrived at Serokono.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing to a low-body mirror reveals a robust reduction in Gag-mirror in Harn, while in patients with high anti-body titers could be a variable reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutralizing natural effect on the enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of Gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be found in connection with the incidence of undesired drug actions, even if the occurrence of adverse reactions were typically dropped with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and the preventing a further accumulation of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and cells into Lysosomes, most likely over Mannose-6 phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients showed the mean phenotype and only a patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had an ongoing expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute line in the 6-minute salary test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme treated patients compared to placebo group an improvement of lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the anticipated FEV in this period is not significant and the absolute lung-volumes increased more than proportional to the body-size of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with a Hepatomic nuisalie reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of the Gag-mirrors in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was found, which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, the clinically significant changes has been taken into account in the 6-minute salary test, in general improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients who were under the age of 5 (16 patients with heavy sounding form and 4 with the middle class form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage due to increased GAG- mirrors in Harn was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined after the Z score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium-run form, a normal spiritual development speed, whereas in the older patients with heavy sounding form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations were performed on the dynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schematics on the Gag-mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute salary test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent patients, the difficulties with weekly infusions, represent a representative alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schematics is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2377">Patients also need to obtain intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetremixed dose as well as after each third control cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetreins, a complete blood image should be created prior to every treatment, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombozyteness.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartat transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course, a dose of Dosage must take place under the occasion of the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the foreseen therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, the patients must be treated according to the tables in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood flow.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Patients non-hematological toxicity in grade 3 should develop (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 doses of hematological toxicity or non-hematology toxicity 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above, compared to patients at the age of 65, an increased side effects of an increased risk factor exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non-sufficient data to inconceivable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a creatinin-cleance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments that are recommended for all patients recommended dose customizations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin cleance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver functional limitations of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper leg value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3-fold of the upper limit value (with abduction of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (at presence of liver metastases) was not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients have to be monitored with regard to the bone markedly and Pemetremixed must not be administered to patients before the absolute Neutrophilic count once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocytes increased once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose of dose for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute Neutropsy count, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 hematological and nithological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients with Pemetreous treated patients have to be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce unconditional toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible forestation of the reproductive capacity by Pemetreboxed, men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - Ginn, advice on the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-cleance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroids (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g per day) to a reduced Pemetrexed deposition with the result of a multiplied cause of side effects lead.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is offered when in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-cleance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDS or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or Acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and mindes- (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As there are no data regarding interest potential with NSAIDs with long half-time interval such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of barley status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the INR (International standardization ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient's ducks with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed during pregnant women, but as in ande- antimetabolites are expected for an application in pregnancy severe birth defects.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemical therapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like Cisplatin), as well as chemical therapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as anti-antics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is known as a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin which prevents the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemical therapies, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemical therapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">Compared to Dolasetron, these figures were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with severely emetoed chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a corticosteroids by adding one before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colorectal age, patients with amnesty compensation or signs of a subacute Ileus are monitored according to the injection of engmeshed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, it is advisable to extend the same treatment of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or the extension to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In the context of chemotherapy alone, Aloxi is supposed to be used to treat nausea and vomiting in the days after receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical trials hemmed Palonosetron detected against tumours of the five examined Chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady metoclopramids, an CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Cimetidine, chloroperidol, paroxeterir, nitrate and terbinafin) no significant impact on the cleance of Palonosetron had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies cannot be applied, therefore, Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary from the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common with a dose of 250 micrograms to observed side effects (a total of 633 patients), at least possibly with Aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and homelipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity and reactions at the administration site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing expertise.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose the similar dose of adverse events were observed, such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-drug relations.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective treatment with a aloxiation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients were treated with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-time 7.3 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours), which was given to day 1 without dexamethaso intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of pallonosetron, patients receiving 32 mg Ondansetron received 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of clinical-based chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetoed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron was comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the policy channels of the ventricular de- and repolarisation involved, and extend the duration of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. and administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentration of a slow elimination of the body with an average terminale half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrating time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in general in the entire dosages range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in visions and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average mean (± SD) increase in pallonosetron plasma concentration is 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">The pharmacokinetical simulations indicate that during a daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days, total exposure (AUC0- ∞) achieved comparable value after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax after the amount of 0.75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have compared to pallonosetron in less than 1% of the antagonist effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron found approximately 80% of the dose found in urine, Palonosetron was found as an unaltered substance for about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous fixture, the overall physical activity was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function, the terminale Eliminationshal time and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after exposure, which are considered adequate for the maximum of human exposure, which indicates a small relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Some clinical trials showed evidence that Palonosetron can block up only in very high concentrations of ion channels that can extend to the ventricular de- and repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose) were given in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, trinierenmark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the provision of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should be similar to a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same pathogenic components that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long and persistent) Hepatitis C (one by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">During a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damage damage, in addition, values of the liver enzymes in alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by an yeast in which a gene (DNA) was placed, which stimulates the formation of the effect.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon contributed data to determine the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of the medicine, effectiveness, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">Patients with hepatitis C was compared to the efficacy of alpheon with the effectiveness of reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus at blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns increased because of the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the market-marketable pharmaceuticals have not been sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that were on treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon inflamed the disease in more patients than with the reference point; Alpheon had more effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study included in the study test for the investigation of the question of how far the medicine forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not sufficient validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (one with crust formation) and small infested Indications (Riss- or chipped), bend dicals and wires.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo shall not be used for the treatment of infections which have been proven by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because alarm against this kind of infections may not affect this kind of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years, the surface area should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should re-examine the patient and drag alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blockades of bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacteria) in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indian indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was observed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo said to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin were observed in a similar response: when the results of both studies were taken together at skin care, about 90% of the patients were treated in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was caused by the treatment of Abszawa (eiterated hollow spaces in the body tissue) or of infections which have been proven by MRSA, which is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Regardant (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections occur towards the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirings, obstructions or wires.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. for approval from Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients who have no improvement within two to three days should be demonstrated once more and an alternative therapy will be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is abandoned, the ointment should be carefully caught and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections where MRSA is known or assumed (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary-infected wounds, the efficacy of retinitis in patients with infections which caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered when after a 2-3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma concentration which have been achieved on human skin, or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant Hemp is not to be expected in vivo (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times daily, 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the medium retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to its low systemic exposition of topical use in patients, dose customizations are not required for treatment if topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive distribution of oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement of effects on the birth and the federate / post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical bacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In case of decision whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued / terminated, between the benefit of breastfeeding for the sucking child and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo were used, the most frequently reported adverse events at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation of Clitopilus passeerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis of the bacteriellen of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosomes, which differs from the connection of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding of ribosomales Protein L3 is involved in the ribosomal P binding and the peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding to this binding point, Pleurobratiline the peptidyltransfer to block some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomaler sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin should appear at least some Infection forms should be informed about experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates are sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a nonresponsive to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulance factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was raised 1% Retapamulin Salbe a day under Okklusion to intact and put on the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical use of 1% Salbe smested to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP shirts.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolic Metabolism in vitro oxidative Metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, among small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microcore test for in-vivo investigation.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither in male nor female rats signs of reduced Fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, reducing one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2 the diced skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats were observed at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development sticity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillfication) and subsequent toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP's "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Repuse products", the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated point show, you should end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salaries, creams or breotiations on the surface that is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied in the frame of one of two doses existing, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is only used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that one can be led out of two doses of existing vaccines required.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a final dose of hepatitis A or B can be desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine is given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have in effect by bringing the immune system (the natural defence of the body), "as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as "strange" and antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the registered vaccine Twinrix adult and the Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccinations are applied to protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adult and Twinrix children are administered as part of one of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adult, also used as proof for the application of ambient temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indian indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient temperature between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protective ambience of ambient temperature was similar in a sixth and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of ambient temperature (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, heet deficiency, pain on the injection site, redness, matter (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not respond to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic) will not be used.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a approval for the Intransport of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardised plan for basic equipping with ambient temperature is made of two vaccine doses, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six months and twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection bag is required for hepatitis B as well as for Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or with a combination impetus.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured whether immunity individuals who are demanded on an Hepatitis A- vaccination, as they are also protected as protection, as they are also protected by immunological memory by immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for the rare cases of an anaphylactic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardisation scheme is recommended to the combination of the hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemalysis patients and persons with interference from the immune system, no anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody being achieved, so that in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular dosing could result in a suboptimum stimulus, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombozytopenie or blood clinnitus, Ambirix can be injected as an exceptionally subcutaneous in these cases according to intramuscular injection.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the shape of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheria, tetanus- and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib), or with a combined mason- mumps vaccine, was the response response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients under immunologic therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is generated.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccine doses of adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matologists, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thiomeran- and preservative inhalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines were administered at the ambient temperature of 1027 impoters at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of ambient temperature was compared with the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher skins of pain and matter on a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambient temperature, but not based on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the treatment of Ambirix at 50.7% of the test subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects after the treatment of a dose of 3-doses combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccine cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who received the ambient temperature was administered over pain, compared with 63.8% of the subjects that have been vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matory was comparable high (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, the ambient temperature, compared with 36.2% compared to the subjects, which received the 3-dosing method).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and soid was small and comparable to the combination of the combination vaccine with the 3-cans vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1 to 11 year-old impflingen, the occurrence of local actions and general actions in the ambient temperature was comparable to the hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per sample, reports.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of impflingen, which reported over heavy side effects during the 2-doses vaccination, with the combination of 360 ELISA- units. ininactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B- surface antigen, was not statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials which were conducted at impflingen during the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparable study which was conducted at 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses of ambient rix and 147 received the standard combinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose nutrient significantly higher than with ambient temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The response, which were achieved in a clinical study of 1 to 11-year-olds, reached a month after the completion of the full vaccines series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the impoters received either a 2-doses vaccines with ambient temperature or a 3-cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units. ininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of floor divination ranged from 12 to 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with ambient temperature in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction against both antigens was comparable to both antibodies after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination mold, consisting of 360 ELISA units forminactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were comparable for 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 month vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambient temperature is administered at the time of a combined diphtheria, tetanus-, azellulary pertussis-, inactivated Poliomyelitism and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, inactivated Poliomyelitism and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccines, was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotect- and serum conversion rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since the opening of the first approval for the Inpermissions, the CHMP occurred the view that the benefit-risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix is only placed in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug may be limited due to its low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzymes or with hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentration).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is divided - split into several single doses at meals, mixed with food mixed or via a gastrostomieschlder (through the stomach-leading tube) or a nose-probe (by the nose into the stomach-leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparable study, because ammonium cannot be compared to other treatment or placebo (a hypoallergies, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium is also able to reduce loss of moisture content in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid or taste version, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) came to the end that ammonium is effective in patients with interference from the urinary cycle to high ammonium values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium has been approved by "unusual circumstances" due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indicated in all patients, with which a complete enzyme already manifested in the newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-lasting form (incomplete enzyme defective, which is manifest after the first life of life) an indication of the use when Anamnese exists a hyperammonium encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sirectile Dysfunction AMMONAPS is also available in granite.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated into account of protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manipulated lack of Carbamylphosphatristase or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of Citirlin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a arginosuccinatristase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets must not be given patients with sip disorders, as a risk for the formation of Ösophagusulcera if the tablets do not reach immediately into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol), sodium per 20 g of sodium polyphenylbutyrat which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with congestive heart failure or severe kidney insufficiency as well as with sodium reflux and edemic formation only with caution can be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolisation and deposition of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of this results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contra-trained (see 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year-old anodisischen female patient, which developed a metabolic Encephalopathy associated with lacunbreakable encephalopathy, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5 month old small child with an extraordinary single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacacetate that showed a dosislimiting neurotoxicity in a intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacacetate is a metabolically active connection which is conjugated by acetylglutamine with glutamine acetylglutamine which is excreted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxides); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the removal of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with interference from the urinary cycle can be assumed that each gram of recorded sodium polyphenylbutyat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the earliest symptoms of the disease was almost always infectious disease, and the disease led to treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their nitrogen-free analog computing within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen deformation (sodium phenylbutyate, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacate), proteinated Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to diagnose the survival rate of neutered disorders (however within the first life month) to increase illnesses to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy during the first appearance of a hyperammonium encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological deficit.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-clinical form of the condition (including female patients with heterozygotes form of the ornithintranty bamylase deficiency), recovering from a hyperammonium encephalopathy, and subsequently treated with sodium polyphenylbutyat and a proteinreduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurologic deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is born.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after a single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyat in wet healthy adults and patients with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat were found.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycles or hemoglobin, according to different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning, no phenylacate is detectable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium polyphenylbutyat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentration in the plasma level was five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The drug will be excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium polyphenylbutyat with toxic and non-toxic cans were not enlightened effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example, at instabiler Angina (a form of pain in chest-cork with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebing" (abnormal value for electrocardiograph or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">When angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with anxiety or heart failure to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with the traditional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and an GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was frequently a stent (a short tubes that remains in the artery to prevent a clasp), and they received another drug to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without gift of GPI - during preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or Revascularisation) after 30 days and one year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undersubjected a PCI, angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients, possibly sensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other milestones or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It cannot be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as with people with high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox on the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a approval from Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (IA / NSTEMI) in case of emergency access or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous charge of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in other sequence a PCI should be given an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion of the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI in clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a dispensing of 0.5 mg / kg is supposed to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous intravenous of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of these intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Safety and effectiveness of a certain Bolus-gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second layer should be charged 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolusdose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney functional limitations (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that can be subjected to a PCI (whether using Bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower rate of rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose is 0.3 mg / kg, and the ACT once again check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitoring during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood flow, especially when Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if PCI-patients appear under bivalirudin most of blood cells in arterial point levels, in patients receiving a percutaneous Koronarintervention (PCI) can occur during the treatment of principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are treated Warfarin and with Bivalirudin should be treated, an monitoring of the INR value (International standardization ratio) should be observed in order to ensure that the value after removal of the treatment with bivalirudin will be reached before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombozytensionshemmer), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of blood.</seg>

<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding have been defined according to ACUITY and Timi measurements for heavy bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding also occurred at Bivalirudin alone compared to the groups of Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular bleeding or bleeding intervention, hematoma with diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known blood pressure, Reoperation due to a blood supply, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood locations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "misc." points, retroperitoneal, gastrothic, ears, nose and neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin in 6,000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin Group as well as in those with Heparin was treated for women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding also occurred less frequently under Bivalirudin significantly less often than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system classes in table 6.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinoor, which binds both in the catalytic centre as well as on the Aniotic-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The engagement from Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin siting the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin, with serum of patients who had come to heparininduced thrombozytopenie / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), was not induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin represents a dosing and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is used by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg of Bivalirudin should be increased and the infusion for the duration of the intervention at 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, injected the thighs or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood, or insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter times as a short-effective humaneness.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was tested in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in one study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, with the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indian indicator for the efficacy was to change the concentration of substance glyclized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive to insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can act on the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra was used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal pains or the delta angle or subcutaneous injection through continuous infusion within the range of abdominal bags.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin level, the insulin requires reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes to the effectiveness of the brand (hereers), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dose or demolition of a treatment, especially in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoazides; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be stored under stringent supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycemia depends on the impact profile of the insulin formation and can therefore change to change the treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the tilt of hypoglycemia, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, monoxyphylline, propoxyphics, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effect of sympaolytics such as Betting, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenches must be weaker or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on the reproductive therapy showed no differences between insu- linglulisins and humaneness in relation to the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin is overtaking into the human mother's milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, yet it is resorted to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the cases of clinical studies listed, grouped by system classes and ordered after declining incidence of advances (very common: ≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of available bait data not abassable).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection range, can occur in the result of a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemented with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an intravenous person or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a Glukagonism projection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify and avoid similar episodes for the severe hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially due to skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous stion in the effect of insulin occurs faster and effective duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melanoma, insulin-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucose level of glued effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a subproportional increase of the glued impact effect, exactly as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal humaness and achieved the full glued effect effect about 2 hours earlier than Humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was deliberately that during an application of Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before meal a similar postprandial glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was placed in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpale control was given as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If the insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is given as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 tablespoons before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at the gift of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given in comparison with human beings, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - downstream) after the beginning of the meal in comparison to humankind, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
