to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M &apos;s just displayed website . as the default , the display begins with the root marks of the document , example : the element , all other no@@ des are under @-@ elements of this root no@@ des .
the module &amp; fs@@ quer@@ or ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in it , emb@@ ell@@ ished folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graphic . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of a object small or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in this way . in this way , large files can be easily detected when they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . consequently , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a graphical and interactive version of the UNIX Â® -@@ command you are considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; it is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . simpler navigation possess the right corner of meaning@@ ful colour and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode , can either represent a depth for the light detection of the dis@@ course or picture of a different file size such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can define whether they are displayed at all , only if sufficient space is to appear or whether the surface errors can occur in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can define the relative position of the labels in the rect@@ angle .
when defin@@ ing algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should rule the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this target will not always be maintained , and this frame will not always be available to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square .
as split the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is always adv@@ anta@@ geous to avoid space losses due to space . the best methods are in terms of lines , columns or recur@@ sive two locations .
you can set the minimal surface area for an entry on the menu entry in area . instead , a yield sample is drawn in the area of the superior entry to show that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .

what is a Digital Stock Management - off of the process that follows the image and the permanent storage . each of the photos took up , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips as you can back up , inv@@ ent and use photos how to use photos . we look at the procedure for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ics . we look at downloading , ren@@ ame , rate , stored , stored , stored , stored , editing , editing , and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Exchange takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secu@@ res , transformed , trans@@ duc@@ ed and exported content that hab@@ its a mon@@ et@@ or or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is according to your definition data containing information on or a documentation of other data provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim to find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to know how many photos you have , then you will not know &amp; digi@@ ous ; . the way to store met@@ adata in a database as well as in the image files are guaranteed very quick search and a secure archi@@ ving on which you can easily access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you have to maintain any system in contrast to data structure . your image files must be arranged on your computer . you must decide whether to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc ; Be@@ ware that you have to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found rapidly over your location . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes st@@ acking processing easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies securing strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to activate the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently add the met@@ adata of the database into the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change ? there is a met@@ adata Editor for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , as you need to select any photo passwords , labelling and evaluation . of course you can select all images that need the same attribute and then start the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best pictures .
let us know now with key@@ word , keywords , how to continue with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you have catalog@@ ed images from another source with embedded j@@ ars , then &amp; digi@@ p@@ ses ; automatically insert the tree for you , then add images to the right place . the Chang@@ ing of Hier@@ archy is not done within the tree . the modified topics will be done by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while keeping the under@@ trees .
the graph shows how different met@@ adata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are all of the pictures .
enough of the key@@ word - the next section refers to labels or comments using the third important tool to catalog@@ ize your met@@ adata .
you want to just see most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
check out this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then you will start to see some details , people , space .
and now I tell you that the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! it starts to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence . so you can see your perception this panorama completely .
for others , the title is possibly more important than the image itself to produce an interest . if you are showing pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him about the motive that you can understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can store any text in an international alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export your images in web @-@ galleries , then these labels will be exported according to your wishes into the labelling and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ System .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a bo@@ red planet before Earth ? well , because with pictures the train from the spatial presentation is now already with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ ism are already in@@ numer@@ able and are still going to be deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can download the photos at the entrance site . you can also download the photos at the entrance site . you can also export the pictures at the entrance site . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .

the following description tells you what information in the interior page of &amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; as information should be deposited to :
author ( syn@@ onym for educ@@ ators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographers , for example to protect the photographers name , then the name of a company or organization can be used . after which this value was saved , he should not have changed any more . this field does not support Com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for Writ@@ er Line ) : associated with the author . examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be title as : employee photographer , Free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the authority , this also must be filled .
editor ( Syn@@ onym for Provider ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify who offers this photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press , then this organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing picture , the group / Agency will be displayed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not offer protection against abuse . anyone who have a little more than basic knowledge is able to delete or change . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ens ; will be available in the near future such module for st@@ acking processing .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same which you can pass through traditional paper pictures or negatives . this section is about problems in the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has the reasons a data loss .
in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated as a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality , you can also get more difficult and more expensive . there are offers on Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe this is in your meas@@ ur@@ able space .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can store good dis@@ cos and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheap , but you &apos;re writing much reliable . so it &apos;s the right to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able for errors even if you just have been written only . therefore , they use a control plot mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they use chemical aging , ultra @-@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not available for Mac@@ s . there is also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to store the format War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything about CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media . read then the media with a description , date &amp; author code and then in a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read this media or software that can read these media .
flo@@ ppy manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : disk is missing
in brief : dis@@ cos will keep the longest error rate . by lower temperature control , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART can not notice the imp@@ ending failure . these are in particular reading errors and shift counter . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally reset without any big problems .
while most electric devices are not much account , these can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes , complete data loss , hard@@ war@@ e@@ age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against power gri@@ ds is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , it is usually included in the form of a plug @-@ to @-@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a specific minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects protection against lighten@@ ers and protects the right connected devices .
since a cable can use each cable to your computer , you should also ensure that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cables that include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specifically designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling .
while a over@@ voltage protection protects your system against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of indispensable data . it can therefore be meaning@@ ful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ tension , these tools can automatically add battery power when a power loss occurs . some models allow them to be able to run up until current . when you purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they might meet the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare his safety at power disorders with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think that your computer is so good for you to drink all cables before you go to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service provides S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as your backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities on data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com makes online storage services available on photos . your free storage is available to you in full resolution online . the professional version offers you more at your disposal , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited storage that should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , web solutions are very secure . data transmission errors are automatically adjusted for adjusted and with the large firms it is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory . there@@ with , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to data transmission errors . data file system and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one occurred when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection for that day . no one seems to be thought of your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to be thinking about it . the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer data set than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transfers , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data flow . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you &apos;re not particularly affected by transfers problems , you should see in the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seem to be one of two candidates that can be handle and highly scal@@ able . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available soon . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the losses in not@@ ebook and 46 % at work@@ top systems . in Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of ste@@ els is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the mei@@ osis . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody had been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of investig@@ ative processes during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and final result . even DS@@ LR cameras have a limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk can be found today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make it any other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . so you ins@@ ure your data frequently after one plan and test this backup before you do anything like the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange plates or size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected during the moment .
a Des@@ aster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect all the space or the whole house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ction means a non @-@ local storage . bring your sick@@ le up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a moment of a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete system . this creates a complete moment of moment@@ um on two points : the complete backup and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : one backup of the files have been changed since the last f@@ use . this creates several moments at any time . you can restore the original status at any time again . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that it is only shared and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily install on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer tran@@ scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files actually changed . this happens un@@ compressed and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
backup key images directly after you have saved on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ tics medium .
this approach allows you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come to a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of work for at least one month and a moment of moments for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , associated with IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copy the images on the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet .
thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that about the period of time you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable because of your nature . unfortunately , there is no other way to leave with caution while the time flies . unfortunately , there are no other option to be used as certain wax . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s go out , which you have to have the scal@@ ability with the area and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and close to a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db ; par@@ ted re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read more , then you can create these themselves . this task is simpler from year to year easier .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . it should therefore no longer use .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard developed by GIF . however , it can save much more . it is loss of loss , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . however , the down@@ side is that it is relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IFF needs and a slow compression . this format we would like to save you to store your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as a picture format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can store your images in this format . however , there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open shell file format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on T@@ IFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ adata . a hand@@ ful camera controllers are now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information will be specified using the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it before an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , it can be arch@@ ived separately for the link between the met@@ adata and the image file and as above already notice is the raw format . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application purposes and business models . to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fied efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as pictures on the camera &apos;s camera , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your personal archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you return the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ al . edit , then you should add the met@@ adata . these were cut under circumstances from the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ galleries , use in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ al . in the section adding a photos to an album you can add a description as you can already have on your hard disk , but you can add many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the computer , turn the camera to display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator can be displayed on the lower end and the front images of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras are not available . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of the file order will appear for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on any entry . with the lateral features and met@@ adata of the camera @-@ interface you can see the characteristics of a single entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialogue displays file properties and the photo information that are internally stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all information is available .
the met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata , such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer of manufacturing , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata will not be available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then the selection of all . this invites all photos of their camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; . at download the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to delete pictures of the camera before you delete photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all of the photos , you can only choose the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the photos selected , use the button to download and then select selected . the kno@@ b chosen is out as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available to download . these images have been downloaded yet not by &amp; digi@@ ous ; download . in this case , the new pictures are downloaded from a star in the front window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you want to download the buttons of all , a dialogue with which you can select the destination , displayed in the photos below . the list of existing albums will be sorted as usual folder . details on the folder version can be found in the section of my albums . then choose the destination from the list and press OK .
after you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; invites the photos of the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them out of the camera by using the button delete All er@@ ase . if you only want to delete some , then you need to select this first and delete delete dis@@ chosen .
please note that there are no possibility to restore photos from the camera . they should not be careful if the photos have been successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ album you should be careful if you want to extingu@@ ish them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera memory , you should make it much faster than the camera name , since that is substantially faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaning@@ ful names . this can lead to double file names in the same album . so it can be useful , the date and time , at which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors the image and for the data base . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the options During the broadcast will open three other options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information into the IP@@ TC field . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . then turn the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the Camera fil@@ en@@ ames option , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; for a photo , is displayed below the name displayed the camera in preview . your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera for the next time .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ens ; can all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording to perform an automatic turning during the her@@ ed@@ ity . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and when your camera does not supply these information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic turning off , use the button extended and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera is made about the date where the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ ous ; this sub@@ lime is based on the picture data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ title . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ title . not all cameras can be found in the same sub@@ title . in the page strip Meta @-@ data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in that case stores &amp; digi@@ p@@ ens ; photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to fix this option . use the button Extended and select the option @-@ based lower than the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their hosts on their camera is the button Download . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that can be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images should be uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that a position is meant by the US GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , to the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graph@@ s an area by automatic up@@ take of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphic . Umwelt@@ plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a browser to another &amp; digi@@ ous . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users want to document the site of the photos , or simply document this aspect , it &apos;s good to connect the position of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data into the image ? first you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are many GPS data fields , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about manual setting of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there is a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you need to save these data in the GP@@ X format as it is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign@@ alling code names that can be created e.g. from map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street species . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ; tries to change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous works as possible . there are many settings that change the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ ous ; change in the menu settings digi@@ ous ; enter the settings dialog in eight pages . you can select between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
this promotion can be selected on embedded preview or image processing . they set up the standard behaviour of &amp; digi@@ al ; firm when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ ac@@ ity and copyright data . these data are written automatically into the respective IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is synchron@@ ised to download from the camera monitor . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s professional photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the car field it must be filled .

&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats . to prove , you can add the file expan@@ sions of this list and remove . any file in one &amp; digi@@ came ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no of these enh@@ ancements , will be ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the kno@@ cking right from each category .
the settings of the light from &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be switched on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . this option &amp; quot ; in the whole image size of lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better access results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be selected with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this review can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
using Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next statement .
with the P@@ NG compression mode , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a quick @-@ loss algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high compression . in this case 1 : a low and 9 provide a high compression .
with the T@@ IFF file compression , you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of T@@ IFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm .
with the adjustment of loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can save losses free . even if you were written the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard measure is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at od@@ d rows , this difference is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ ing pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the camera is used to use camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , based on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors the effect can get more details in four steps more details in peak power . for other cameras , this option will ignore this option .
the standard is the top @-@ light , so the parts of your images are on display the top @-@ hand white in the settings . the setting colours generates some exceptional results since it shows the top speed in various ros@@ at@@ ys . la@@ stly , you can try to re@@ design some parts of the missing information from the val@@ ents .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ design the missing green and red shares in the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set up a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the l@@ umin@@ ous value according to your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the default 1 . but this can also be made in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing is done too . to keep the time for the demo field , you should be conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ field algorithm is a digital imaging to calculate a complete image from the part @-@ filtered image sensor that produces many cameras and that is known as a matrix color pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it has been used as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm that used by me . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you will be carried out during the shell .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and are instructions as these should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ p@@ ments ; information like the color information from a color space in the other to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavi@@ oral questions , if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile file S@@ ing here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug ; the folder exam@@ ines during the start .
settings of ICC @-@ profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; default value for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen .
input profiles should be used for the camera manufacturers and model you need . not all profiles are produced on the same type . currently , there are some examples such as Canon , which does not need any color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ correction . this means that you do not need to carry the color command itself for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are further options like the soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could manually correct , instead of leaving on the fl@@ ashing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is planned for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this response is of course un@@ official :
the Canon Profile Extension can detect the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for neutr@@ ally , P for neutr@@ ally , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image analyses and image work@@ ings supported . many modules support , which were written in order to work together with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are loaded by &amp; digi@@ ous ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main seat and beyond . furthermore , you can also see some also in the context menu of the pre@@ text menu .
sh@@ orth@@ le for tasks that are carried out of modules can be set to set up settings in the Settings menu .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjusted the time between the image passes , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes on met@@ adata is one or off , which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during display .
the camera qualities indicate a list of all the cameras supported on the left . if you want to use it , make sure the camera is connected , switched on and in image display mode . currently , serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices are currently supported .
at the bottom end , you can place the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field will only be active if you have chosen a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you &apos;ll have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera , or / m@@ nt /
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer to put them into the display mode .
check out if &amp; digi@@ p@@ came ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can manually set camera models and port manually . after you set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can choose any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when del@@ eting a photos in an album . find more details about the del@@ eting of a photos and del@@ eting of a album .
editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be tac@@ kled by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the display of the Welcome Screen Saver &amp; digi@@ plug ; when starting with Star@@ ts , this will accelerate the start process of &amp; digi@@ al .
the start to search for new photos are forces &amp; digi@@ ous ; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ al . if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ p@@ came ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can select below settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be seen below :
these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will find further information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to the correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by selecting the entry menu / editing menu .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; so they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in section image processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
one menu bar at the upper edge and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common features .
the processing functions of image processing changes your photos . none of the functions will however change the original photo before you have used Save or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo again as soon as you have saved the picture .
you should therefore possibly start a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save with file stores .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by rest@@ oring the image processing and restore the button to restore the image processing into the tool bar . you will then lose any change that you have carried out at the photo since the last store .
almost any promotion of image processing can be re@@ produced or restored . the last promotion can be reset , retri@@ eve and re @-@ manufactured by editing editing and restore them from the menu .
if you often use this , you should use the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ switch @-@ Z to restore .
when you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you will receive a moment longer in the tool@@ bar or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a text menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also made in the same way or restored .
once you have started image processing , you can easily move between photos in the same album or same key@@ word by using the image buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image r@@ unter or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom @-@ out in the photo and you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ oleum or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the Es@@ c key . in default , you can change this in the setup dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; change this window . see this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or entire propositions . you only have to select images with the default methods and select from the menu album Export printing assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation devices , even in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear , or disappear again in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can add labelling with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labelling are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after you have comments on , use either the button user or change to the next image , which are stored then .
besides the user button there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting , which will always be written in the pictures .
the section evaluation shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ cer@@ ations . it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ age C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar will always be used on a picture . in order to evaluate more images simultaneously , select these from and use the text menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding is followed by the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ word overview shows a search box to filter words , the j@@ wor@@ ries and a selection box with the previously available in this &amp; digi@@ al session .
the key@@ word is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the given search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering the key@@ word in a picture series . if you have posted different j@@ words , these are stored for quick access .
passwords can also be set up by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all tags of a picture will be stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be used on the highlighted image and not applied to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the side@@ bar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed in the main window . usually the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , j@@ ector and searches . if additionally one or more j@@ ute filter out of the right side will be displayed only the cutting volume of these two . all passwords are available .
you can also drag and pull off . suppose you have selected several pictures to be provided with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists already , you can simply draw it out of the right side bar and place the selection . then a dialogue that asks you if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the j@@ igsaw is on no sample , which was reduced to three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then , a key@@ word from the right hand side was drawn and put there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will be held at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or later , you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or character string , which is already in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I used it mainly on &amp; digi@@ ous ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one is using a color @-@ administered workflow , you can achieve a predic@@ table variation of your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ administered workflow , you can achieve that the colours are using your camera or scanner . you can print or publish the colors on your digital dark chamber from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme comes on color management , everyone wants to express what buttons he must press for the results that he would like to provide informed decisions at any point of image processing work@@ . the sense of this tut@@ orials is to you provide sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , you will receive links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result .
if your image sequence meets all of the criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works well and the life for all so easy , why should you use another colour space and make your thoughts on color assets ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ ons region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sion@@ al representation of s@@ RGB using some bigger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working spaces .
do I have to worry my monitor if I have decided to work only in the s@@ RGB space space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB space space , as s@@ RGB you will have to close your monitor . if you are working as the color space of s@@ RGB , you will need to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , final , Autom@@ atically and contra@@ sting the menu correc@@ tions automatically from your colors to make the best . they will be experim@@ enting with these effects , to see what is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the characteristics of the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour shaded . this function is often a lean correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same method is adjusted to the lumin@@ ance factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity difference is as flat as possible . thus , this is the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in one image or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusted the red , green and blu@@ epr@@ ints on the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the shift of the lowest and highest levels of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ p@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white @-@ like photos .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per suit . if you can do so far from the original image , you can do so far from the original image , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ bal@@ ancing algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start the menu entry colors white and image processing .
the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image is also adapted to the preview of the tool . if you want to see the preview of the tool , if you want to see the original protein bar , then click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of pixel under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you can change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be indicated . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and Gamma . the shadows Adjust@@ ment lets you improve the shots of your photos or down .
an@@ stat with the above insp@@ ections , you should use the colour temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then click anywhere on the image preview for the correct colour temperature of white balance . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values automatically .
additionally , you can set the white @-@ down with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the predic@@ tive dict@@ ator increases the colours when more than a colour channel of pixel pitch is displayed . this will be displayed as a pure indicator as pure indicator , and does not have effect on the final image .
buttons stores than and store accurately this . every setting of white equ@@ ates you have set to store in a text file and re@@ load again later .
the button pre@@ ferences sets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will be a different photo when your original will be revealed . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the code intake per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suitable for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also needed for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more record , calcul@@ ating time and is available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool gives the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour coding can be done by the sub@@ window for the magn@@ itudes . a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can draw up the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of audio files . this tool ensures you to use multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always do the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . you can find further information in the manual .
a very powerful way to correct loading problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find at colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects brings you four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ onal filter available .
in times of chemical processing , solar thermal , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created when one developed a partial pressure of a short flash light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas of dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative image of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . another increase is a negative picture , that is not to be created on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy effects . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the process ( 2 ) . the applied intensity lies at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filters sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ assy . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one of daylight optimized color film of the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contra@@ sts . but Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colours are also some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially of which the un@@ suitable landscapes are too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates neutr@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large pictures the filter can remove the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the colour con@@ tra @-@ effects of your photos with the tools in the menu below . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you want to make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ment / contrast / Gamma is the tool of audio @-@ value correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders . in concrete , the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window includes a Graph@@ ene of Int@@ ens@@ ity values , a hist@@ ogram , active channel or selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sli@@ der can be turned into the inside and to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control kno@@ b and consider how the image changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , on the settings the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this select box can be set , whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is frequently used . images of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic sub@@ division is useful .
three control : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image used to automatically adjust the input of the shade , medium and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
outputs : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range . there are also two controls that can be used in order to evaluate the output values . for example , the compression values can be used for example . the compression of output values can be used for example , while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values are automatically set in terms of intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and re@@ charged later . in addition , Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour cartridges , the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun @-@ rays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to apply the input of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ load dict@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is indicated . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically dependent on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel of which module is modified by the module :
in addition to this bugs there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . mostly the linear mode of sen@@ su@@ al mode is mostly created . in this case , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding to dar@@ ker or dar@@ ker the associated image pixel .
in the preview of the original photos is a red marking . if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value , create the original value . create a point on this line and move on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you can create in the file system and later loaded , the file format is the Gim@@ p cran@@ ks@@ format .
if you want to create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and sunny . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ load dict@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here , it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below , you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in a lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun beams has been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer der &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels , or modify the colour shaded colours of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer to the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be regarded as a comparison of its own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are below : kno@@ b for red , green and construction allows you to activate these channels . if you activate the respective color components , this is particularly convenient if you are also able to activate the option of mon@@ ochro@@ me , as the channel mixer is then used to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you come Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from colour@@ less . color@@ less . if the case is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ less first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ load dict@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white a work step , as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .

with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , a pop portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture text texture apply for image processing .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the slopes of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper text aspect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the relief relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of an viewer to keep the limits of a photo is no easy task . to keep the image of a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier for scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , select the desired screen type for your image . the image with a white line , Nie@@ p@@ ce surro@@ unds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white pictures ) , it displays it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : there is the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will have larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert a simple @-@ format text in a picture of any popular place . this also goes on several digits when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type text , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need them . if larger the image , the larger must be the character set . to the end , you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . already , the picture is done .
every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; OK &quot; button . after the image has been saved , the text part is part of the image . it can &apos;t be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool templates can apply template on a picture .
the menu template can be used in image processing , to put templates on a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be able to add to the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of &amp; digi@@ ones , just send an e @-@ mail in english to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; ma@@ iling list digi@@ plug @-@ Us@@ ers @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool to first use , you need to put your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder where you will notice the templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder will update the template strip of templates .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b enlarges the indicated image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduce this button : this button shr@@ inks the bottom of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole image , you need to adjust the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move the template underneath the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use templates on your image . the picture will then be adapted automatic of the front size .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ one ; presents three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy to produce , especially in dark areas , gra@@ vy images .
un@@ shar@@ pen@@ al mask works on the contrast of the edges to look at a picture shar@@ per . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather psychological . you can use it to remove atmospheric d@@ ost and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by Win@@ ston Chang .
the focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is that sharp edges will be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . this is the same phenomenon can be observed when colour@@ ings are printed on paper . SLR cameras will normally require more subsequently effective shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private user .
at JPEG pictures often a camera has been applied internal sharp@@ ness . images in the shell format must always be pushed in during processing .
some scanners apply a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo by shar@@ pen@@ ing throwing . this allows you to correct the menu entry .
you should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness technology increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise of a picture . in general , you can adjust it via the menu entry . under realization , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ isp@@ y . the solution to fix the image a bit soft and experim@@ enting with the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the menu entry . the front window on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter in@@ sharp m@@ asks is a very good tool to remove mu@@ gs from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help the image . the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should be tried out . if you make the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask to strongly , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats will create in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger et@@ ches . they should therefore shar@@ pen images at the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the missed picture one of the original is added , thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the s@@ welling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the differential amount . one can define a minimum difference to ensure an edge of the filter . in this way , areas can be used with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of un@@ sharp m@@ asks filters . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working picture ( 2 ) . im@@ perfec@@ ting was applied using a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ welling = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ one ; tool re@@ focus is focused on a picture of improvement of the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected fil@@ ming filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create a picture on &amp; quot ; re@@ focused approach as just to try the photo . it uses a technique to shar@@ pen@@ ing images . this is using a technique named F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ing . it is used to start better results than un@@ sharp . you can start it from the menu by using colours repro@@ duci@@ ble in image processing .
in practice , the circular f@@ iller works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ split . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ess is also moving from the source pix@@ ies , which is far away from the original pixel size . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the G@@ auss is influenced in most cases very strongly from distant pixels . the un@@ wanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the most important parameter for use this module . it is the most important parameter for use this module . for most images , the default value should place 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very sharp then , but on Heiligen@@ sch@@ a .
correlation : a correlation of the correlation can help reduce arti@@ fact . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ fact . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is added even further .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your un@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive filter causes them . in most cases you should use this value to 0 , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transformation matrix . if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter . in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any repro@@ aching parameters that you have set will be stored for later and then can be re@@ charged .
try all the cutting , color and intensity blocks on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by this , the un@@ sharp m@@ asks a larger neighborhood used as shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to be solved in@@ sharp m@@ asks always arti@@ facts . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it can never show the effect of the lens filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the infin@@ itely mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ clear colour image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing la@@ sty in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator : if the lens has been dar@@ kened , it has been dar@@ kened to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour content allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want to use blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired art@@ e@@ facts with unprecedented speeds .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences of starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pre@@ ferences are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass place above the picture . a value of 0,9 should get details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note that the details can always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
angle depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value gl@@ oth evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gra@@ ins or CCD noise will create a high value of wave similar pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best eliminated from a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this is the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of space in your image .
control resistance : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is required , the more is smo@@ oth@@ ed . this is necessary when it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ let effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repeat : is how often the algorithm will run through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle of angle &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , there should also be small . be sure to create a small angle a long run@@ time . you should therefore choose this value as maximum possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step @-@ wide &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ per in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ and and never exceeds 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More to quality you get by selecting this option is only low . he doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
buttons stores than and store exactly this . any setting of image errors can be correct with a text file and later re@@ charged .
correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a very long and a high CPU load . therefore , you can remove the calculation at any time with the button ab@@ orted .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with little arti@@ facts . as you see , there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film location during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ens ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear .
this tool provides selected image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts which are used for example dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ v ; effects of single @-@ called images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot depic@@ ts a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ dient space that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the lower window details and the lower window of advanced settings can remain on the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time of filters per pixel and can be p@@ amper@@ ed by the radius listed above the image and the color in it is smo@@ oth@@ ed and therefore smaller faul@@ ts adjusted for adjusting .
sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ pen@@ ing gel . this value sets the pixel pitch to reset the filter to the front . if the value is too high if you need to change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image data can &apos;t get more and noise or repro@@ aching .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole noise can occur or smo@@ kes . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak smoke or JPEG arti@@ facts , without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings will not affect the smoo@@ thing process that will be controlled through the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . this settings will not affect the smoo@@ thing process that will be controlled through the details settings .
gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically increases stronger , however , the shadow areas are contam@@ inated .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ os@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance , when it is too high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove pir@@ ate tips and is the recommended method for this .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise level you have set , can be stored in the file system and later .
this is an example of how cat@@ ching your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the fixed with ( 2 ) . the noise level was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture to cra@@ ck for your purpose . lu@@ ck@@ ily , the solution is a bit easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to fix the menu with the menu entry and experim@@ enting with the smooth . the front window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools used by photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable ar@@ tic@@ ulation of your images . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s pre@@ conception , scrat@@ ches , compression parties and local errors that makes it possible in digital , original or retro@@ sp@@ ectively digit@@ ised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the picture con@@ tours and receives the content as it also makes human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for paint and tex@@ turing . the tex@@ turing is performed with another tool , the image error correction , developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ Ã­ and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts minim@@ ize : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it even produces some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these issues .
buttons stores than and shop make exactly this . any setting of photo rest@@ oring can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a very long and a high CPU load . therefore , you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce a photo with equality noise .. The module is applied on a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film @-@ gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and adjusted under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be used on an old color photograph , which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts which have been detected by scanning lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos that were covered with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by the copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the picture dark . the tool is automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to you to discover the dark picture right within the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the proper dark picture to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant re@@ members the last dark image and re@@ loading this automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview help you correct within the picture . the front window shows the output of the movie with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted up in all imagin@@ able areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the following filters are available :
Dur@@ ation : there is an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a gap of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ 6 ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ 6 ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixels in block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ming method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block is pulled to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ 6 ) or a group of quad@@ r@@ atic curves ( 1 @-@ 6 ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ 7 ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ 6 ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , used . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the adjusted picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ animal correction is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ ation , i.e. , lower corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially in the medium and large photo format , can often not shed the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ animal quot ; ( shaded ) they reach the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light into the sensor . teleph@@ oto lenses show that this behavior can also show this behavior .
but he also has dis@@ advantages . a lot of Center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens , also with center filter , a opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects through movement arise .
with the large exposure ranges of modern movie cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using a equi@@ valence of a c@@ enter@@ filter , which is used without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ animal correction apply the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or random a lumin@@ osity of 2 , deci@@ ding the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ation , reduce him to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
leu@@ ch@@ ment , contrast and gamma settings : the edit of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction is reduced the lumin@@ ance of pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the regulator will only increase positive values as you need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re@@ jection of the exposure of the target picture , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ation in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . it was also carried out with the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second order deals with the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ ot form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round @-@ effect , but fla@@ w@@ less due to the edges . this correction is not used in the mold .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distortion is almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second order . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distortion is corrected and positive values are broken down distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger in changing the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls the &apos; corners Par@@ ameters , the inver@@ ted signal of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads to a correc@@ ting first degree . negative values increase as positive the image .
clear : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values improve it .
in order to help you the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of distortion correct . the values you use for your image are stored and the next start as default values are used .
the tons or ho@@ id @-@ shaped correction should be done before all conc@@ ision or size changes . if you want to re@@ cut this correction as all first by . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and carry out a ton @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ se .
to help you the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal support line . move it into an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in connection , you can correct the tonne / kis@@ ses distortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a ho@@ op shaped distortion is corrected the resulting image of black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the Menu transform@@ ers from the image processing or via the zoom kno@@ b .
for most photos the ton @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some mot@@ ives as e.g. photos from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture below 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always keep a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ cu@@ cum@@ ber and org website that can be found under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a @-@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you want to sim@@ ulate two parameters of film @-@ gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film production and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
because the filter channels are mixed for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information are missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the peak power .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter film production is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures , e.g. the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , well known to increase the sensitivity of the films by the manufacturer of large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ effects effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ ce@@ ful view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the KÃ¶r@@ ner . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ based effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper elec@@ ts the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better for big pictures . smoo@@ thing the smooth or from the other hand , the ar@@ iness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and the # 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter coal drawing uses colour and int@@ ages gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ bage k@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , images of their gra@@ dients are slowly changing . it is helpful if you imagine what scene would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . these are good pictures to start .
there are two controls with a range of range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b sel@@ ects the foundations size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the charcoal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is the image in 3 @-@ D when it was stamped on wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engraving is a quick tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , with which color does not use the most important at content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the picture into a grey , landscape landscape .
the depth allow to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by distortion @-@ effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : the image is divided into cells and can look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by means of un@@ shar@@ pen effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lens : wi@@ per the image along the constellation lines to go out from a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive camera and produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al effects : wi@@ per the image by rotating the pixel by a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the lens of a turning camera .
distances : kno@@ w@@ out the picture to create a non @-@ focused camera content . the object seems to come back into the background .
motion shar@@ pen : kno@@ w@@ out the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
turn@@ out un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing : wi@@ per the picture soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and sub@@ tle light .
SchÃ¼t@@ te shar@@ pen : wi@@ per the image by random shift the pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ises : finds the Far@@ ms in the picture and wi@@ pes these without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . therefore , this calculation can therefore cancel any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelf drops on your picture . this makes it natural your images a great look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n cop@@ y@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
the drop size makes it possible to change the size of the drops . since the drop @-@ size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the amount and density of drops . fish change the optical effect on the image .
you can keep up with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing a field free of shelves . use the range of tools to select the area , e.g. a face that shall be free to remain free . if you start the filter shelf , the area will remain free of shelves .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the proper orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers .
photo auf@@ asen is definitely one of the most developed tools to get a photo , with a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is how you can zoom in a picture ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm which is used here is a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool used to change a linear interaction method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to bub@@ bles .
many educational programs use a sort of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the riders new size and count down below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio should be retained at the input of the new size .
control resistance : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is required , the more is smo@@ oth@@ ed . this is necessary when it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tower effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons stores than and loading will be used exactly . every application for photo , can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the larger image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison .
the cut of a photo is not only an frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the mouse allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and move the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle when you move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview as your photo look like your photo after cutting . you can create the size of the cutting area by moving to the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle create by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting button , use the kno@@ b button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or file Save to the File menu to save the new cut @-@ cut photo .
in the frame area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by changing the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the width format is assigned .
the tool After side effects uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , ir@@ respective of whether you use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons for selecting the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool according to aspect ratio , its settings depend on the image sequence ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data can be reflected in the image image and not the original image .
you can help grab the settings of the interaction for help to put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ious parts are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third row , harmon@@ ic triangles have a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that can be found in different natural growth patterns , such as spiral in a Nautilus shell or the bub@@ bling of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we are as nice .
the golden pitch is the Ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already in the old Egyptians and Greeks , who used their temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos together to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is guided from Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where every number is equal to 1 : 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows as visual harmon@@ ious .
the golden middle makes fluid aid lines available when you assemble a picture . these help are shown below :
the Golden spiral becomes good results for your photos to get closer . compared to third @-@ party gel , the golden spiral line produces a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
a further rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angle . there should be something that the eye is in the center of composition . this can be a line of its or different objects . this can be just as being without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also discussed by the golden spiral . their ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden @-@ corner . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles have no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to place a static object of dynamic .
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame you will create a effect from professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options horizontal and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the kno@@ b color you can set the colour of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this type you can adjust the color of your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture , where things are rot@@ ated vertically or horizont@@ ally . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target range .
turn your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide is specified in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module is provided a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture , you can find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function transform@@ ers cut from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic . choose one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing should be smo@@ oth@@ ed the picture a bit after the turn . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transform@@ ations are carried out around a reference point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right side of dialogue , you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
at the top left : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
at the right above : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle links below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right edge of the transformed territory .
after the adaptation of the perspective , the image will be dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations generates an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after completing the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . a possibility to ber@@ some it is the image with transform@@ ers cut from image processing .
the tool bar is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . with other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transform@@ ers .
sciss@@ ors your image by using the Horizont@@ al angle and the vertical angle . if you press the default settings , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown on the right of the front section .
to help your help become a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point like e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool bar to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the shot , the picture becomes a bit smo@@ ked . this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes are twice as much as the amount and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the picture , the picture has a nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the image with transform@@ ers .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ens ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . therefore , the available formats are related to your system and in some cases , from the type how these libraries comp@@ ile have been comp@@ ile . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to process a large number of images formats with &amp; digi@@ al .
due to these depen@@ dency on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ; displays only files in formats to know . this is done by file expansion and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ al ; accepts . in section configuration you will find further information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select that file format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia , and supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures based on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw material converter from &amp; digi@@ plug . in section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ b , which is in &amp; digi@@ ous ; this includes more than 200 raw material formats . this table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; digi@@ ous ; they are supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . but if you click on a movie file , show &amp; digi@@ p@@ ments . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use the program to play playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward when you went back before .

all configured cameras are displayed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check in the camera after further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you &apos;re doing the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four directions with the module white .
many tools that you need the phot@@ os@@ el@@ ab@@ oration are included in &amp; digi@@ al . their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ sign , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp m@@ asks , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Text@@ ur applicable quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left you will allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the site area . these modes are :
vertical , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left side shows the original and the right shows the filter used on the right of the selected section .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter used on the area below the selected section .
vertical section . the left area shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper section shows the original and the lower to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the presence area , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . used colors can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can move this frame with the mouse within the picture and want to look at the part of the picture , which you want to see the preview section of the dialogue process is updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on their default values . all entries from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely declared . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider provides an intuitive graphics card based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull off a square . all pictures within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course that your pictures will be Geo @-@ data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and to select and ren@@ ame colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can either be used for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color , and last used colours .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder into files .
the cur@@ sor will be displayed as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used too . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . then move the mouse at pressing left mouse button .
if the check box is activated via the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the check box below Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used along with the promotions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line signs , if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;
the colours in the palette and output of the colour choices can be pulled with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color register on the left .
&amp; graphic viewers ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing and graph@@ ite ; programmes are free layout programs . graph@@ s are available in science , particularly in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ ut@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graphic viewers ; is a K@@ DE programme for viewing &amp; graph ; -@@ dot ; Graph@@ ene . displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the Graph@@ ene is newly calculated and in &amp; graphic viewers ; represents )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; graph ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ Compon@@ ent to open
load of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to read more than this node )
another required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which the &amp; graph ; tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s are required . in detail :
the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in its own lower window . initially , if you start &amp; graphic viewers , the main window will only open the Symbol file and opened the ( empty ) list . click on the first icon to display the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse bike ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; graphic viewer , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the alter@@ ation . &amp; graphic viewers , can also realize your decision whether later also . should you want to change your choice later , you can use the menu item settings : setting up ... see , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei out of a running &amp; graphic viewer ; open @-@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , or to be able to display the loaded graph in a lower window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but then change them with the setup dialog .
in the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use several sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ ite , which are on a side , will be fixed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph@@ ite .
page description with one on several pages shared graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different font
the page again loading the option to determine if a file is changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or re@@ viewing the modifications ) or the program each time .
the site opening gives the possibility to establish the behaviour of &amp; graphic viewers ; setting up when a graph outside of a current session is opened . you can open a standard behavior for this case or determine that each time is being asked for each time or in a lower window of the already running session .
the page seat management gives the possibility to establish the starting behavior of &amp; graphic viewers ; setting up a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required at any start .
the text menu , which normally appears in a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph ; -@@ lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms choose . entries as shown on the web site of &amp; graph , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or historical represent@@ ations of related graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as possible few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for invali@@ d graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations in accordance with the dive model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equally significant with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for invali@@ d graph@@ s a jump model - layout . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ aling , and includes a multi @-@ gr@@ ate timer for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .

open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should give the graphical file to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such layout command , you can add &amp; graph ; the &amp; graph@@ ite ; algorith@@ ms have special options , or change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or un@@ done ) and apply the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invali@@ d graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not display and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the -@@ mouse button . click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to obtain further assistance to that element ( if present ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images give tools available to read new pictures and fl@@ atter@@ ing them .
this module can be used to convert new pictures from external sources and fl@@ yers . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner which supports the San@@ e project or another source like e.g. video streams . so that &apos;s how you need K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
if you scan the menu entry pictures , a dialogue which you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears that you can replace the default value of the default settings in order to read the image and adjust the area your needs . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window is completely displayed , since some settings will not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target pattern . here you can also see the compression and type of image file . here you can also select the file &amp; # 160 ; select or create files by the image .
screens you can generate after you have selected in the menu of Imp@@ or@@ acle &gt; screenshot ... selected . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop in order to convert a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the opening program will disappear , so you can read other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read off after a short delay , the currently visible workplace . if you have read the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen photo will be waiting before it starts . if you have to switch on other work@@ space , you should select that delay much enough to get the time to navigate there .
once the screenshot was made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ .@@ Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit the met@@ adata of a picture . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF sample of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization is provided by images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo , is used to loc@@ alise . height , long@@ itudinal and latitude are used .
to cor@@ related your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as a XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialogue appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file also contains data the same time taken at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , there is an automatic correlation between the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set here your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera capacity . lies the deviation among them are collected . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related to all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a wide time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then cor@@ related the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialogue . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same site . as the dialog , the coordinates of a call to the next you need to use only the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge . choose the relevant region and increase . add this always through , until you have an adequate accuracy . the card must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to add a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module allows you to export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums used as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to enable an best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings . you need to select these albums only . the albums will not select hier@@ arch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text of the text will appear in the head of the HTML page .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ expl@@ aining . the option for each image has a page . when you click on a picture a new page will be opened in the image . otherwise , the picture will be shown directly with your default image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed on the picture .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery shall be stored with all your associated images . choose a folder on the write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
in case you have chosen the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other colour depth , you can change the default color depth . the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are expl@@ aining itself .
the tab Pre@@ views allows you some of the settings from the album tab for the front images , that are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press off to break the process .
if the module produces the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programming interface to determine whether defects occurred during the creation . web browser will automatically start to show the preview of the gallery . press the Cl@@ ose button to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and on them basic oper@@ ations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming , or shifts . the viewer can be used with short sleeves and po@@ ets . it was developed for a quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after launching , a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to alter images without blocking your quality .
this module allows you to save images from the JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is rising since no comp@@ ressing of the color information takes place . this can also be found at P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ click is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ Kli@@ ent is currently not a documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ .@@ Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata Editor is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the ma@@ iling list k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org des K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the met@@ adata model , you can copy data from a picture to another copy . then select the import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the sequence option with which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JPEG is in writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of Di@@ ash@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , add the packages of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background colour for the slide . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you must select the images that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can start the module about Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are then included in image files in the portfolio . there you can also s@@ orting the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the picture is set down below . a low value creates a very sudden , high contrast , very smooth image changes .
the background colour can be set next . in doubt , you should send them black . the name and the path of the generated file you can set under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension of the extension .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . once you can cook your wishes to the movie . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can now drink a coffee or drink a coffee when you come back again .
if a hint appears that code or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right settings below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on one sheet paper along with a sheet of paper . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM respectively .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ b by Dave Coff@@ in . a original score from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results like the software from your camera brands . sometimes you will get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re@@ define the values in order to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option decides , whether the camera settings are to be used as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further refine the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and store the conver@@ gence result . the file name remains equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file size .
the tagged Image Format , T@@ IFF , reserves all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W Com@@ pression .
in case you often have to edit your pictures or later , you should not use the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ated . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a memory format , the met@@ adata will contain in the RA@@ W file , stored in JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the stack mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time . use this mode therefore if you are sure , for example through testing an individual image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress report shows how far the conversion is gone .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of one album . you can pre@@ fix the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the time .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image and enlarge . in addition , four types of the image will be provided :
proportional ( 1 ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of photo paper . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it &apos;s also possible to change the size of the selected images in advance . more images can draw on the list of these images and remove them there .
after you start the module , the images captured by you are displayed with the selected pictures . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview of the right shows will be displayed on the right .
you can also draw pictures on the images and add the list to the list of images .
the selected pictures are removed from the list of selected pictures from the list below .
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new message from your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and subject to the subject . these pictures are already attached as an app@@ endix .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the sent e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used once again until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must install the G@@ mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images into a text file , and the mail was enclosed .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG pictures on file format and are original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the latest images .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed with you . however , your e @-@ mail program is started automatically at the end . with the button Cl@@ ose you can sh@@ it this window ? EN .
after the start of the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have shown your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose between you selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Trans@@ itions option is using very elegant image outputs using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the Di@@ ash@@ au is very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ames option indicates that the file name of the images will appear in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop makes it possible to display the presentation in a end@@ los@@ se loop . you can manually break it manually with Es@@ c .
the option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random sequence . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album .
the time difference between the images can be set between each images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should get out this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . randomly cho@@ oses any other effect between pictures .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a tool bar at the upper left screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn off .
with this tool bar , you can start the presentation and start again , stop the previous and next image jump and stop the dip .
at the lower edge of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ .@@ Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the lower menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; a photo album ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , then in each group , so in people , places and in the group topics are available .
in the browser window you can see the categories , for which you have entered more than you have provided your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the actual presentation pictures . in the following is described each for itself .
if you press with the mouse on the entry , changing the browser view . see picture .
if you are able to select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible . by this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images on a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view images with presentations to view the images of your activity area .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can store up &amp; photo album ; however , for every person there is an own pre@@ conception , this also applies to places , j@@ ector and other categories that you have defined themselves . see the picture .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button on the right outside on the tool bar . in the published context menu , you can select that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can display a sample with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of key@@ word ( if you have no appropriate pictures ) .
however , you must select a picture displayed for each individual person . in order to view this , you will have to select a picture editor , as shown in the picture . here you can select the picture for the appropriate person . in the saf@@ est window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and that part of the image will be displayed or cut off .
when you sign up in the main window , give you a dialogue , which is very similar to the dialog for the cerem@@ onial of the image properties . this dialog allows you to see on the picture even once .
if you want to enter a string in the box type or description , the labelling or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , such as 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images as well as you can see in the picture . here it will see pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and look at the fast @-@ up , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; photo album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu help the menu entry in a photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some example will be uploaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the lower edge of the main seat of &amp; photo album ; see the timer . a picture of this cor@@ p@@ est you see here : . as the name suggests , this Lei@@ sts show you data about the images in your database .
the timer can display you several different time units . each body shows a different unit . you can change between units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the timer can be interactive to the following ways : you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you see a date , you will always see the first picture of this date displayed in preview ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images at the moment when you will navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of time line , so the time values , pull you in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can pick up the selection by clicking on a bar at the time bar .
&amp; photo album ; you can create two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; a photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user book it will be described in &amp; photo album ; built @-@ in version , which you can create about the menu HTML ... instantly .
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following is exactly described above .
first , enter the title of the review and description , which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example pages you can see an example for this settings .
next , choose from whether a &amp; a photo album ; -@@ export file should be created on the reviews page . ferry information about export files can be found in .
last you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . this allows you to be shown that all pictures of a party are obvious . note that all pictures are exported ; currently all pictures exports . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain amount of sight .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most import@@ ation options are clearly , why this is not made special .
below the page you can set different resolutions for images . this allows you to view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures more than the resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
you can change the resolution of your site at any time . it can therefore change your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time , as well . if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL , where your website is stored .
best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for any subsequent proposition a new sub@@ folder .
first you must select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically adds to the next time . this folder allows you to select either a file or a K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check that this really all visible for viewer . if you select a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL , which you can define here , should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong file .
in the case that the HTML @-@ files created not yet in the final target file you will need to manually copy them manually . this means the import function , see , right now you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files but the basic folder where all sub@@ folder are located .
the just configuration options are related to all three on basic folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder created whose name can be specified in the output file .
if you are interested in a family party , a meeting or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; a photo@@ album ; you might want to add a HTML page to viewing the images . if you &apos;re already looking for a lot of time for viewing the images , persons on the pictures , entrance location , etc . , you need to be able to do with &amp; a photo album . this work cannot even be done .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . image properties will be included with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they distinguish themselves in the file or whether the images are stored in the file or if you have any pictures taken into the file , you can keep all pictures together and this file can be stopped independently . the obvious dis@@ advantage is however the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for a double way . first searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if you are not found the images of the URL , which you have given to create HTML files , this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export images are described , which you can export about the menu Export ...
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three options available :
when you enter the manual close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the automatic copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; photo album automatically ; the images automatically set for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ress the files . if you like this , simply select the export file compression .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you can send the pictures maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can say the size limit , for example , that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from a web browser or from the menu file imports ... select &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to the import@@ ation consists of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folders import images to be copied .
it can be that you are to use the category persons to be imported to the imported file ( if you are a d@@ ans ) while this category is asked for your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported into account in your database .
in the fourth step you can use the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this you can see on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and look at : when you see images , one would often jump in from different picture groups jump &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture of your friend , you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) of the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ability to pass through .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos . thanks to many places in this manual it will be spoken about images , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; records all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top @-@ file of their images . this is a simple XML file that allows you to back up a dis@@ kette or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; photo album ; note the folder where your images are stored and used this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another database with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry settings of photo@@ album ; insert ... come to a window , which allows you to change the settings of &amp; photo album . in the following section of the book booking you will discuss the various setup possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can call the setup possibilities of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available that you can retri@@ eve a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you as you can define for each image , for example , people , locations and tags . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each available group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue options you can set complete membership groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained in a group rather than in a group .
in view the setup possibilities you can choose to specify the member groups . you can select the category selection list . in the left hand side , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . you will find the homepage of Ki@@ pi on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; a photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules themselves .
since the modules of multiple applications are common with each other , it can be tested with the demo database , before you use these on your own images . demo @-@ database allows you to either call the command line with the command &gt; photo album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; a photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that are also using K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order for albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; a photo album .
to sim@@ ulate &amp; photo album , the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture review currently .
in addition to the current album &amp; photo album , the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then every record this category represents an album for the module .
or there will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums , so you can do so for example the category people , so do if you had selected persons to view and continue the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the modules , which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you can start &amp; photo album with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the top one menu and a tool@@ bar . under the tool bar , you can &apos;t have any information about your images . in this section we will be back on this window , and now click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes , where the picture was taken on the picture , where the picture was taken either separately or for a larger number of images may set up certain notes at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box , setting people , locations and passwords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; when you will always use information about your images .
the following idea is the shift of images within the list : if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can find that the names are shifted upward , which can be found faster and arrange them .
if you prefer a alphabetical list of alp@@ habe@@ tically , click on the icon for s@@ orting to date under the list .
if you have chosen notes for each image , you might have to process all selected pictures and provided these pictures with notes . click here to check the back and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the access di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add a entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also add a entry to a category and place there to make this entry on a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this is ahead that you just sort your categories alphabetical order .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the di@@ alog@@ ical di@@ alog@@ s by forming the top @-@ edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a window of its own window by drag him out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , you are pleased with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the option to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame too complete . if you want to get displayed this window later , use the button options ... and click here a / out window . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select images in your browser , you will receive an overview of the currently selected images , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have any filter here . for example , you can see the size of the front images , configure by simple to drag the mouse with the medium mouse button . try it easy .
if you place a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this image will appear on the picture . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures from the images . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to er@@ ase and press either the removal key or select either the removal button or select the menu Edit . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use photos stored on the hard disk . of course , you need to record images anywhere , thus &amp; photo album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album . if not all necessary pictures from the hard disk can be loaded .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the images are available , so that &amp; a photo album can indicate that you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see this feature you need to copy files from folders and copy it again . if you don &apos;t want to avoid troubles , like the passage to your images , please buy a bigger hard disk to save all images on it .
in the menu images you can find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , you can view the images that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on the current view . alternatively , you can also select all images that can see your little sister , cont@@ ests and the menu entry everything except current view .
so you have set that pictures in the case of the fish are to be hidden . if you want to lock the laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , making all images that you have been locked . if you want to display the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to establish a password , which must be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , choose your password in the privacy .
please note that this picture protection cannot be sure . for one you can read off all pictures on the hard drive and to the other one can read the password as a turn@@ key text or delete the password as an un@@ turn@@ able text . this type of password protection is only to be familiar to those who are with &amp; a photo album ; not very familiar with view to private pictures .
the reason why you spend all your images with &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to view them sometime . for this reason you can look at some point . for this reason &amp; photo album . this is a picture _ and video viewer . you can look at the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer . it is of course the image , but an additional information you can enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily move it with the mouse , and you can also configure which information displayed and whether all of these options are available on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , matching entries to this page . if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can jump between them and back by using the keys picture high and image below . you can jump on the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a dip . &amp; photo album . as frequently it can print a new image after a few seconds . as frequently it can be controlled by the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus or Min@@ us by pressing the button C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; photo album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer , you can easily pull out into the picture . with the mouse button , you can easily pull out a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom back into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ ic .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the default setting up the zo@@ oms , so each pixel is equal to a pixel of the picture .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work on videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ sta@@ ste .
with the shooting functions of the context menu , you can turn the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make any comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you see images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put it on the picture . at the moment you can watch the image and view configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . but you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and consider further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on paper to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you see one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics while you see . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in see a picture of which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , you can see them in the browser . so you can see all the pictures you want , print or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . afterwards you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the front view , then you can add features to the pictures , then you can simply add features to the images by pressing the letters for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you are allowed to paint &amp; photo album ; on the picture .
the brick is not stored with the image , but in the database . you can do this way back later .
you can see a picture on the painted way . in order to switch off the painting mode of &amp; photo album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . simply remove the cross in the tool bar at the top at the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; do not have to rule the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely prevail , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood them .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then the properties will be displayed in the object properties and the object included in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the object of an selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will allow you to choose the right position :
you can select selected objects from the scene either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you &apos;ve changed properties , click user to check these changes . if you enter invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can click the input errors and re@@ dis@@ card the changes with break .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter your documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
if you are editing a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview of your own view .
press a preview of The Sc@@ enic View and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture . if you want to ren@@ dering a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element , even if you want to ren@@ dering a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross it locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotating as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through drag with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a fe@@ asi@@ bility stage . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level or as absolute value . objects will be displayed only when they are selected or their Vis@@ i@@ bility stage less or equal to the scene selected in the tool@@ bar level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need another order , you can save them as well . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and switch between different assign@@ ments .
to set a window over or under one view , drag the memory to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the memory to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the facade in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card pack re@@ ite above into the views .
the last possible window order are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the ri@@ pen@@ er on the desktop or click on the small to the left @-@ pointing arrow on the top left .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu , you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can ro@@ p them in any place .
the current window view you can save with window window order ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can submit many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview of up to full images in the highest quality .
if you click on the icon of the object in the tool@@ bar or select in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the wrong image . if you want to ren@@ ame only a small area of the image , select the bottom section and enter the image section to ren@@ dering to the input fields .
in the combination field quality , you can select the features that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering , this is based on a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the cleaning features can be found in the user manual , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture with just a beam per pixel , different errors can be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ Ã¨ pattern or chair effects in curves and lines , besides , sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general , pictures are better from this feature .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , then connects and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ ting because each pixel is again split again and adap@@ tive because each pixel depends on calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values indicate the specified threshold , then two pixels will be calculated using a specific number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , a grid of 4x4 is calculated using a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values the pre@@ defined threshold is divided , the pixels is split into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which will continue to be pursued individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ u@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the Ra@@ ys to avoid frequent pattern .
the final setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this cart@@ on card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file impulse ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently it supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet not the complete command @-@ up of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when when import@@ ing error messages or warning messages , a dialog box shows a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can remove objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds text file in the editor . to import objects in the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag him into the object tree .
with copying and insert into &amp; po@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is divided . usually this po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the help in your own view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the quoted object . set the path to your document tion and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ dd@@ les ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characters .
you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and shooting .
larger values give an accurate wire model and thus a better se@@ wing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as ball , you can set the details stage for two directions .
when you cross high detail accuracy for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections of the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this feature makes a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects are rounded . the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you cross the floor , a bottom right below the objects are rounded . the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you activate Cant@@ onal terms , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering scenes . the values for depth and s@@ welling can be adjusted . precise information about the parameters can be found in the section of R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in section window arrangements is explained how you can create and store window arrangements .
the combination field standard window system : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order in the start of the program .
the list of pre @-@ hand shut@@ ters shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can easily create and remove a selected arrangement with the kno@@ b button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below shows all the views for the chosen window order . new views can easily create and select selected views with the kno@@ b button .
the position of the new window . with new columns you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with im@@ pe@@ e you get the window under the existing window , using map card together with the previous view and sli@@ pping the view , not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow without any more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should easily create the ultimate but easy scene : a ball on a plane .
but you should have carefully notice the following warning before you compl@@ ain that you can only get a result of a black screen . if you use a 3D program to first use , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t adjust camera , no rules can be applied to the ren@@ dering , as a result you will receive a black picture .
if you don &apos;t add any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture .
if you have anything faul@@ t@@ less installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ set window order :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their use .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and select the menu entry editing . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view . this is the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera will find . in user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for instructions , but note that you can change the camera in view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of camera . just click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button user or button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a controversial method of the solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire @-@ model view is now also the level , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ounce the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
if you see the object tree exactly , you will find out that you can click the options for each new object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shift . choose one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene you should move the soil to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just so you can get to know some of these parameters . choose differences and adjust the values as follows :
first , choose the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment .
in both cases a dialogue , where you can choose to select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a sheet black material because you can still need to enter the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . also , you &apos;ll have the colors for the pig@@ ment . now there are many possibilities for this , but take the easiest ways now .
if you see in preview no color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click the button to check the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you get your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course you are not the colour . here you are necessary to enter two new attributes . in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this entry twice , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree every time and change the colors in view of the object characteristics :
this step you should also easily execute , since you should have understood the fundamental work mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the bul@@ let can be just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input button or button to press the button ) , so you would like the ball over the ground , as you have moved the ground down a unit below .
of course , the ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a m@@ ole black material . put a suitable material in the following steps .
if you have selected the ball , you can now show a material now . as in the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select the right object and change the name for example in spher@@ ical pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , then choose single @-@ hand and set the values as follows :
but you may reach more interesting effects if you take time to set some final features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of it which allows you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , hopefully you have already learned much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you &apos;re looking for a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing , the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will result in the scene and how atmospheric effects , such as ne@@ bula . thus , the scene will be mach@@ ined to pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously every scene must be saved , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the Standard file dialog , you can select a file that you &apos;ve created before using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space .
presents the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry , if you do not have any changes stored in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . you can only select this menu entry , if you are used to do editing .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or add an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , the keyboards and change the default behavior .
opens a dialogue to change the keyboard abbrevi@@ ation . you can change or add new settings for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands or newer .
open a dialog for the device of tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to f@@ ake rough surfaces without any bending on the surface without changing without the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then be mach@@ ined to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ball show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images on display .
images can either be displayed in a single window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with Click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the Return button .
you can set if any picture is displayed in a single window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , you simply type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then , a small input field is found in the right corner . if a proper file name is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box - &amp; ball show ; there are five boxes maps . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the working mode of &amp; ku@@ l show ; set in the two , sh@@ orth@@ and for the browser , the key need for the respective window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour that you can go down below . the default is not full screen mode .
this point is enabled , invites &amp; ball show ; the next image in the folder while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for slide show .
with this option , &amp; ball show ; in case of opening the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ball show ; this folder will be opened in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ball show ; so do that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display windows to the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
specify whether the sli@@ deshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time period between the picture change in a slide show . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is cancelled by the user . to enter the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here , change the key short@@ cut for the various modes of &amp; ball show ; in the card pack short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of file system with folders and files in a window .
displays great symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short setting .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short setting .
shows pre@@ images for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in short setting .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .

in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color when the under@@ - or over@@ load dict@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ies should display the colours with what you should display in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure of a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ case photo ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also find this page in the image processing . you can click here in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; channels l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that won &apos;t make more than pictures to scan and fl@@ atter@@ ed .
&amp; channels l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images , which do not make more than pictures to scan and retri@@ eves . can save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before the image .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E Project page by entering the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projection @-@ projection .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; channels . if this scanner can &apos;t be opened , or if no standard scanner is given , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop and finish al@@ l@@ ite .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not contain these options .
in order to convert a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ ach@@ able and then the scanning area for the final scan is started . the front button is started by the preview button .
in order to select the picture better , the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom so that the complete preview can be missed into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if there is a preview of Search for the Settings , then the image will be selected in a pre@@ ten@@ se window , as shown below . if store is pressed , then the image stored and lie ? EN will lead to a departure and you will come back to the main window .
through the button Settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened in front of the main window . you can change here the most important settings .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before storing a preview . if this preview is not desired , the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the species such as &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; pictures saves the dialog in front of each image opens the dialog in front of each single @-@ called image . when &amp; channels , this automatically opens with a generated name in a defined file , then you will need to ask for a file name .
this setting defines where images are stored in the Save without after a file name . if the pictures are stored in any scan , this folder will be used as standard for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a image pre@@ fix to save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . it automatically receives a num@@ eric s@@ ff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to the store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the kno@@ b help starts the K@@ DE aid with the &amp; Cal@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; Cal@@ l@@ ite ; The button settings dialog shows the dialog for the Settings and Cl@@ ose can be used to finish &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs key short@@ cut . below , you can click on a list of these cuts and their function . please click the &amp; amar@@ ok ; specific key trac@@ ts you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button to click on the right button and select short commands .
you may be able to set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this will make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample set for the D@@ COP @-@ function break could be &amp; z@@ b ; like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ lines options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; Amar@@ ok has some own command lines options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all the modules are present and use the dialog , so the user suggests why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ identi@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; . dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the file scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or use it simply to expand the required features . they will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple .
using D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every K@@ DE installation should be enclosed .
most scripts languages allow external programs and commands . this will usually be called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; sent noti@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts are written continuously on the default of scripts . for this reason , scripts should react on their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use of it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change signals that a new piece is used . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu entry , Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be added . in order to add a menu entry , the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script add@@ res@@ is used to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script Mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; end , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed by a web server . these packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be compressed as b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept the script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right right away .
the main subscription must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and the link to the Viking scripts page of &amp; amar@@ ok ; add up for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , but is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily move music into the play@@ list , instead of going through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very particular title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide what you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is just getting difficult for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ list will automatically choose the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many more generic USB devices . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
usually , in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to comp@@ ose the following , to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have any difficulties when comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ list .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; like most applications , some options that can enable or dis@@ able to enable or de@@ activate . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ ile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; in@@ scri@@ bed on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card maps for setting up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the play@@ list , the Player window is switched on or off . if the option is switched off , only play@@ list window will be displayed .
start @-@ up : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
impressive : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able is compiled . this makes the used colour scheme for the mood changed considerably .
place files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ wav @-@ files are stored on the memory location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ wav @-@ files are stored in the settings file of &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / de@@ od@@ ine / mod@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok ; if a browser is needed .
other browser use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not included in the list .
play@@ list of play@@ list when saving , stores the current play@@ list automatically with the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; dis@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of play@@ list , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
updates to the piece of the piece , causes the play@@ list window to open / down , to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing to context @-@ browser , the Cont@@ ext Browser will automatically display the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next piece is used .
in the image of appearance , you can adapt &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ section .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can select the use of various writings in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can select files for the following area : play@@ list Windows , Player windows and context @-@ browser . press out to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you have to set the Qu@@ al of choice and can set up an own color scheme . do not use them in front and background colour for front and background colour .
play at the start is that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start playback will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , which it was stopped at last .
the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text in the O@@ SD .
your own colors are possible to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . click on the colour surfaces opens the dialog for color choices . if you are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the input field display text introduces the text in the O@@ SD . by selecting space , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . you can define it on which screen of a multi @-@ speed monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the card audio version allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this cart@@ on card .
the card collection will be used for setting all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; as well as music files . to enter a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains instructions for adjusting , as with the selected folders .
browse the sub @-@ folders : these causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both crossed as well as their sub@@ folder to music as well .
changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e. g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes in your collection .
import play@@ list : causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) are added to your collection . the play@@ list will then appear later in play@@ list browser .
the part Collec@@ tible database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can you select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another installation is necessary in the lower window MySQL .
the MySQL @-@ mounted section is used to set up the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is used to enter the MySQL database . later , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use us@@ ern@@ ame : and password : to enter the data that are needed for the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music @-@ recommendations in terms of the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ern@@ ame and password for your la@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces of pieces and thus the profile : this setting makes it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of mir@@ r@@ ins@@ ed pieces to your la@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters retri@@ eve : after activation of this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . note : you can download the list in context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have K@@ deli@@ bs installed so ( including the programs contained , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find such modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD is prec@@ urs@@ ed that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang also the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly there is that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s from this file crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is a bit mature .
make sure all of &amp; amar@@ ok ; used for libraries with the same compiler version . if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to descending at the processing of met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatically if in@@ active for ... in setting up the sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace to the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically occur at a crash ) . if it comes to a frequent back@@ drop and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is that many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but they are not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; NEW $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random play@@ list / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) are always forgotten . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the status disabled on grey and half transparent . please note that in some cases , you need to click on a symbol until this setting shows their effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : un@@ cover symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be re@@ viewing with the &apos; Key amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ di@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first .
there are several options . most installation problems are on the easiest way through the help of an expert your unique or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only an error , if something happens to the device of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank play@@ list . how do you come to music there ?
it &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window is converted into the statistics @-@ window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate the pieces of the play@@ list , the evaluation list must be displayed in the play@@ list and select column review . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press release on your keyboard . or click on your right mouse click on your selection and then select From play@@ list from the folding menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files . just like that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of play@@ list , right next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the button play@@ list . click here .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look even to lib@@ ations , this package includes many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it on the menu bar under Extras Equali@@ zer ....
yes , that is really true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question that supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / WC / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every only possible audio format . G@@ stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG de@@ coding !
it may be ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux in which default no MP3 de@@ cks are supplied ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Cont@@ ab@@ et@@ aste
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well , so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ EM @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables several applications to use the device at the same time and can be reached simultaneously with the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . check out the help for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and a solution . you need to specify another ink ( e.g. oss@@ acks ) .
this does &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media are first de@@ coded for most people , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them , and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .

either you do not use the Arts drivers , but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to receive the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less then react to visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , pl@@ ung@@ ed &amp; amar@@ ok ; as of why ?

read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that &apos;s not helping you can also ask for IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit am@@ aro@@ K earlier ! ) : - Download @-@ m@@ peg videos , comp@@ ile and install it . then you will find the module folder of G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run register regi@@ sters . start well &amp; amar@@ ok ; .

norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , to create a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 @-@ collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the in@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be re@@ produced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch by CD and play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . click on one entry opens the project .
stores the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be asked , otherwise it will be asked to a new fil@@ en@@ ames .
stores the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s dialogue Save is displayed , with which you select a file and file name for the project file .
saves all ge@@ aring projects . this is the same when you call to store every single project .
closes the current project . if a project changed and not saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then choose between store and changes . furthermore , you can break the closing also and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , which should be done , just as would you have called for any project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any un@@ saved project will be asked what should be done , as if you had called File Cl@@ ose .
if you call this entry , you can select via the released dialog files to add the project . this has the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project exhibition . if the current project is a data CD , the added files in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Br@@ ame &quot; for the current Project . this dialog is basically the same as the features dialogue of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open if the project already contains data .
opens the features dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described ? ( reachable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you don &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you don &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is thought for you rather than help you can already see existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustrates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function is removed no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the files imported .
opens the CD @-@ copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another radio . alternatively , you can also create only a copy of a CD which you can then burn some time later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create copy of a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also play a copy of a DVD using copying dialogue . the conversion / cr@@ ushing of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for the form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialogue you can format a DVD Â± R ( W ) which will be completely er@@ ased out of the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
burn a pre @-@ set CD image . the dialog appears after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning pop @-@ fs . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously er@@ ated DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which then can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously trained DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , coding settings and even opportunities for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . these information will be presented in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when a entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small body at the bottom edge of the window is indicated . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is bl@@ ended .
if the folder view is on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the drive or dis@@ card the medium .
switches the content view or off . the content view allows to select and pulling files into the projection view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
turns off the head bar into the projection view or off . the head bar is a narrow area that contains only visible when the projection screen has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialogue window for changing the keyboard arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part you can adjust the key order .
this starts k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant , so you can set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileg@@ es are required , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator to the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings are performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for Person@@ alize and refin@@ ing the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; it is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ scription .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which includes the teach programs .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make sure that &amp; D@@ COP ; functions can be used , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common &amp; co@@ de ; program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and more functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) of the COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) of the tom@@ y@@ d@@ vd ( ) of the tom@@ y@@ d@@ vd ( ) of the bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ image ( ) of the bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ image ( cat URL ) of bur@@ n@@ d@@ vd ( K@@ URL URL )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created Project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) altern@@ ate a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the top of K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
other cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String containing ) An add@@ ess ( URL : : list UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String cube ) , re@@ plac@@ eable items ( Q@@ string path ) for ren@@ ame items ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) with set@@ op ( Q@@ string path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ dable / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT sc@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT sc@@ ate@@ able / d@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; it can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and from many Ko@@ di@@ ers , which are encoded with WAV files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) and FLA@@ C ( without loss @-@ free compression ) . more co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
become in a second step this WAV files ( usually a pro title ) comp@@ resses into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats like the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the read &amp; CD is used by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost any distribution has put together a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already been installed , but it is highly likely not necessary to comp@@ ile yourself . but if the code is not used for example FLA@@ C , its installation is not necessary .
which code / file format is to be used ? chapter Which co@@ di@@ ers provides a small introduction on co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word for copying audio CDs : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case , it is not possible to avoid an protected audio CD ; do not avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ier protection . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once , ( the setup dialog can be found as often called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily use of an &amp; CD will be found on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , where you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ ers are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB file from Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of the commands of the main road . on the page step for step example , there are further information , such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the regi@@ sters for the program configuration .
it starts the CD@@ DB on request of CD data according to the establishment of the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the register card settings in the set @-@ up configuration - encoding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that selecting with another encoder can be read as the default . it is recommended that before the encoder can be configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be chosen to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
open the setup dialog for the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
open the main sequence dialog by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; with different card maps ( such as encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression ratios , and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats used by data compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG have the most common . OGG likes to have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame will be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG @-@ play@@ devices is present .
MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - these tools do only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set media &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate of about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo devices . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely have the absolutely highest quality , you choose the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that manually entered or automatically taken by the Free@@ DB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed / k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; and the code program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with code programs there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or help to the code explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s must be coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator must be added ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
that &apos;s what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , where you can download the audio CDs that can download the information , so that all other these information can be downloaded to the calcul@@ ator . it is to note that here only from text is said : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ ais ) is not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist can still be added to the music company . all information can be found at a bo@@ wel by a &amp; CD ; shop , physically or virtual , can be obtained .
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; it is active to select a check box ( sending a address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems to use the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ eving data from the server ( this can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; for use by Free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically is needed to use the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the computer .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates on the database .
which output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that it is used with cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to be more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed , if this is not yet to happen .
to store the selected WAV files , the code can be chosen to select the desired file format . during the first opening , there are pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) on the Regist@@ er@@ ers tab . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about co@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter of Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a codi@@ le , more information on its switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ di@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal command line . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the shell &amp; CD . do not check out the CD &amp; CD .
there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can indicate how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow are still un@@ certain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ to @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
it must be installed in cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . if it is not fully compatible for your Linux distribution . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files as you can do , of course .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd consists , and that you write permission to copy them ( eg ; try to copy the quer@@ or into something ) .
the first section is the basic set of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - , something probably what is done only once , and
the second section describes this approach to read &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each download &amp; CD ;
here we define the use of using the compression ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . because we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the Free@@ DB to download the data from the Internet .
although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read &amp; CD , but once the appropriate settings are found .
the device record is handed over to the read range that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to create existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the boxes of the General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only if you ask for complete information , so that you will be informed if you are missing information on the information of key@@ word ( tags ) .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD automatically download via the Internet from a Free@@ DB machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; with the internet , so that he can access the Free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately when you are un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or day entries , they can easily change files and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
in addition to this example , if you want to manually enter all manually , select the selection fields and Free@@ DB if you want to download the database before . however , this is worth 620 MB in the offline mode , the two select fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cart@@ on card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB @-@ Server on the Internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . put everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the Con@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look at a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . this setting will however work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls protocol 88@@ 80 &apos;s standard@@ ly bo@@ xed , is maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf in the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , is there a reason why more than one at the same time at only an existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folders for temporary files : if you &apos;re sorry , the path / folders will be specified in which the WAV files are stored . if the box is not connected , the files will not be crossed in the private file . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files .
all such as it is on the screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances must be blo@@ wn up to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo system . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &quot; Tags can also be deleted as required . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of simultaneous WAV files : using a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be coded simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading the CD @-@ CD . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , as we are convenient , and the CD ; data from Free@@ DB has to be arranged . the process is described in this section , must be repeated for each download &amp; CD .
since we are a &amp; CD , which is not included in Free@@ DB , see screen photos a bit different than those for one &amp; CD ; with successfully run from Free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data can be used manually , instead of sending them out of the internet . comments will refer to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now must be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as shown in screen photo . this only when the CD @-@ CD can be identified as audio CD ; can be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous paragraph concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from the Free@@ DB , all titles of the songs are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are indicated .
for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window in the database , and you can select the database entry , which fits your opinion on your &amp; CD .
if you do not have selected the check box for automatic query by Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can manually remove this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but you will need to collect the data from the internet , you will need to connect to the internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - typ@@ ing the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update Title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ que per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( such as if all words with upper@@ case begin or not ... ) , but also to verify if there are any undes@@ ired remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have a maximum of this option . this option is set up on the counter display settings ; take a look into the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of the code to obtain more information .
simply select a entry , the obviously with the style of the un@@ loaded CD ; this example is not important because we don &apos;t review the &amp; CD ; for more information , please go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are available at Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edit@@ ors appears again and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the specified data , which we &apos;ve recorded for the first piece . enter the items for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece for any event and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded data from Free@@ DB . it is sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool bar . note that the artist and album are displayed on the part list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before every line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . make sure that all pieces are selected , or enter the button All pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection read the reading process , this window appears to confirm the confirmation . click OK and then we will see a view of the window with the essays and follow what is going on .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a code which you still have not installed . pieces have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for the temporary files and the targets ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus you can read and en@@ code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program does not find the configuration settings to in@@ hibit this behavior . the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . with performance weak machines the result is un@@ clear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 doesn &apos;t seem to be able to read and en@@ code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the waiting period of the code . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you will need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; today , CV@@ S is able to download an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled Package , da &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package includes . if you read this , you have already done it ...
this section is addressed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help with the program your needs can be adjusted if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs on settings . at the best you can read the step for step example to get the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different card maps of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the aid menu was clicked on the first time of the program , without any indications how it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , presumably the program has started . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , not e @-@ mail . the author can not add this manual . it is the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ - . who is also always something to add or change , may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has read this section and therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange , if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Car@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time tracking of texts also some properties that are other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound projectors , which is required for G@@ US cards , as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of the activity of each MIDI channel by pressing the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can go into &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; per@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the procedure .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; at the finish of a song , KM@@ id starts again with the same song the next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also create a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and get the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry menu from the menu piece or get the space key .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces , they are added to a collection and then follow succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump in any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the control .
when you find that a song is too fast , or too slow , you can click on the arrows to turn left and right the speed display . to get the original speed again , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space key has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the empty button , or select the menu entry into the menu , interrup@@ ts the playback . enter the space during no play , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically dis@@ able , allowing you to manually change the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set a event type , choose the menu settings and rec@@ ie@@ ves from the menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summar@@ ize . these are played in row after . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the Point Organ@@ ise .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original .
if you have more than a collection , you can adjust the each c@@ apped to the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . read that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting manager . there you can add a song . there will be again the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on setting Autom@@ atically the collection .
if Autom@@ atically enabled to activate the collection , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order is fixed .
to play a song , select it in collecting manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump on a song , select the next song next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to jump on a song back , select the button predic@@ tive piece , the entry predic@@ tive pieces from the menu or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button del@@ eting .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General @-@ MIDI capable . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events that under@@ stands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts to the change of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore lets you sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM -@@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all necessary re@@ els for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section which may seem as often as desired . pre@@ condition for this is that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Another Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email , so I can provide support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard , as follows :
please note that the left side of the DC sign is ignored . it is assumed that GM patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the tones that need this instrument on the tone with the number M ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a ri@@ f@@ ical surplus . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ Section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ ensive surplus ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant , with each sound a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , tank , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) is , and not the one that means the clay @-@ height of the same drums ( such as some keyboards have ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify how notes are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section is the sequence of lines very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use various names in the first line .
keyboards are used especially to form tones on the per@@ imeter channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ word .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to replace the first and the second channel , simply make it simply in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will continue to use the name name for this channel . if you are ignored the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will ignore that patch can be changed on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the perc@@ us@@ sions patch on the perpet@@ ual channel .
the value for P@@ itch@@ Ben@@ der ratio can be multiplied in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be converted to the value n , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 4096 is used to be in the map file no dec@@ imal number ) .
this setting is used because GM says that a keyboard with the value 4096 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards up to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ vi@@ ets ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ ves you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . if you have changed a instrument , the button does not have any more green but red , to show that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . select the settings in the menu Settings under the Point channel : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD shows the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so you can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file requires a similar sound quality . in addition to a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binding distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s main page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
to agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , dis@@ able the settings Autom@@ atically St@@ oring the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow button to the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double click .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desk a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , only into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull out .
if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them directly to a collection , turn your setting Autom@@ atically to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open from files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. . you only want to play the first file . so , adjust the setting Autom@@ atically to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then join also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all many thanks ! if I listen to these songs or the postcard , animated me further on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I &apos;m written in the third year , so I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I &apos;m trying to give me a bit time . as hob@@ bies , I &apos;m able to program MIDI files , making music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; do , or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , if you want to send a MIDI file , you should get in touch with me because I might have the file maybe already .
I &amp; k@@ mid ; I wrote &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my free time and it &apos;s not getting tired of money . I would therefore pray that I will only get my programming messages because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. BÃ¼h@@ ler - Keep the error that the pitch is too high for AW@@ E cards .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can be found on h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , information look and pictures . you can find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you have no sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs when you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if you have problems , contact one der &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ list or send an error alert directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for MP@@ layers , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files created by MP@@ layers or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; on this calcul@@ ator has been installed .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new releases , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is the window with play@@ list . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed if information is repeated within it .
it is possible to connect the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category definitive play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ hood . if you like an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the post @-@ listed entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed through direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that by using a editor , but also through the application itself . it is simply click on a name of a category click on the menu , and next processing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content is displayed .
after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected with play@@ list , and select either the edit mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the processing mode left or another group is chosen without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and end can be de@@ activated by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / or / k@@ m@@ player / or .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / or / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at Star@@ ts does not need to be short , it will automatically end by opening a different source . however , this would be anno@@ ying with the end animation but the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of an start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G major = &quot; in@@ sol@@ ete ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; in the directory tests / k@@ m@@ player ; are included in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to configuration of MP@@ layers in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the MP@@ layer and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c as the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ os@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the p@@ co@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; you can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list .
to restore the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash will be specified in the setup dialog file of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or &amp; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is able to search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur , the backup output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ o should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV maps , either using MP@@ layers or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV , the scanner can be configured to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is available in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be possible ports to be found , e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably included a DVB @-@ in .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also available only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )

is there tips on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after the integration of the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surface and network support and is required to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . among Unix @-@ like systems probably will probably print on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution can be included . for installation , documentation of the distribution or install CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without additional compli@@ ments and are included on k@@ ile ; web site .
this manual is for all - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals are required for documentation . if the support for this project or documentation , the contact about the k@@ ile ; web site should be established .
if you have any questions about or at the compilation of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or will add extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ art ; functions in a graphic surface and within these a simple , immediate and conversion tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunities to learn the manual on Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right point of origin : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . is the right selection : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is easy to use , can also use a loader ( engl@@ . L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; but a less sophisticated yet more realistic setting is that it comes from the re@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . in order to learn &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ ys@@ r .
as other drawing languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ ational features such as paper format , side effects and text grass will begin with the command \ \ \ { document } and must be closed again with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the fast @-@ rise assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a comprehensive function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the assistant ( menu ) provides some options for the creation of the document . it can also be carried out some of the document related settings .
document classes : with this article , article ( article ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , study ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : with this , the character encoding is set . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly used to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as a standard . if it should be UTF @-@ 8x encoding ( correct handling of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most used packages available for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN requirements ) should always be used in creating German texts .
new users are now not wor@@ ried anymore . it is a short description of functions and more detailed information about this section .
&amp; ile ; provides - as other source code editors - the her@@ ring of the used text settings , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; k@@ ile , it is not possible to verify that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is due to the modest appearance of output file . however , you will save you through her@@ b@@ ying time and the dar@@ ker .
with automatic loading of environments the environments is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ { Command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a short line ( for example \ \ &apos; s { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ cut@@ ted element ) :
in the view of the document in structural view , the individual elements can be changed through a single click on the respective and viewed .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be found very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; straight &#93; file , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information as the font , and also other information about the font collection by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , transformation and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and tann@@ ins .
when searching for the R@@ Ã Â¼ r@@ ts@@ bridge , the elements of the DVI ; file has been clicked on a element in the DVI ; file has been clicked on a element in the DVI ; file format is the exact opposite . once a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; file format is clicked on the appropriate section in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used in work with multiple files . with a master document simpli@@ fies work with other in@@ bound .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted for Project Properties .
fast Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; file text is compiled and the result will be shown automatically ( if no error in the source code ) .
support of the file : in this mode , the DVI ; file is displayed on the non @-@ sol@@ vent @-@ sol@@ o@@ dd@@ ess of the o@@ dd@@ ling , and there is no appeal to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; according to the quick setup .
when viewing the processing tool bar , the three large @-@ frame selection fields should be developed for the fast single @-@ scale elements into the document . the first selection box is for the fast breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The waste and lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Show other products such as Ð@@ Ñ@@ Ð¸@@ Ðº@@ Ðµ@@ Ð´@@ Ñ@@ Ð´@@ Ñ@@ Ñ@@ Ð°@@ Ñ@@ Ñ@@ Ñ :
name : this command is called a name for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selecting a selection box ) .
when using quote there will be a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is necessary for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; they are also written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã Â¶ mer@@ e is used for the definition of the fon@@ ts for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã Â¼ notes etc . there are the following fon@@ due :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two select options for transfer : 1 . the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and fix@@ tures of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason of the hand .
the cl@@ as@@ ps after the command \ \ &apos; s class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the fon@@ ts . if the font is not fixed , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code should be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the men@@ tioning of construction or button construction .
the source code must be saved before the compilation . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage system automatically .
if the compilation of the document fails , the protocol should be sought after the errors . when using fast @-@ construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
a environment ( English environment ) is a text that is different from the remaining document . for example , a report with the font 12 is created , and only a few words are to be filled with the fon@@ ts . the command \ \ \ { Environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ &apos; s { Environment } must be encouraged and the re@@ jection of the fon@@ ts within the environment . &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
the availability will only be noti@@ fied within the vicinity ( from \ \ to { Environment } to \ \ and { Environment } ) . there is no coating ( number ) for the increase in a environment .
there are many ways to ensure read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ sist@@ ence , etc . to be added to the end of the environment .
\ \ \ { emp@@ h } : this command is for cur@@ sive printing and long as long as it is closed , until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . one single word in a set can be displayed in a set with \ \ \ { word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ of { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ &apos; { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background is shown to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language follows , now a step @-@ in @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assistant a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better reading of the document should be accomplished . for this , a quot@@ ation must come to see a few positions within the grease and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem about to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , can be returned to the editor by editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( during internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . try out and play fun .
DVI ; is a reliable file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ v ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer monitors .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly adjusted ) .
the tool bar complet@@ es the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; file text , the conversion can begin with many other formats using the kno@@ ck in the tool bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you encourage the direct jump from the editor to the next door within the DVI ; -@@ file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . only Modern under Settings K@@ ile needs to be setup ... tools are well balanced .
to search for the advance search , the mouse indicator must be positioned in a row of the source text and close to preliminary search . the jump to the appropriate section in DVI ; -@@ viewer is done so then .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it will be included with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; subject to the respective line . for this purpose &amp; ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor shall be specified as text editor ( settings the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
if using quick @-@ construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer is not possible , there may be an error , this should appear in the log file or in the news window .
the log file is the error source in the source code . in the editor , you can always look at the errors that appears in the error . in order to view the faulty line , click on the error in the log insulation and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the wrong line .
once you clicked on the button in the tool bar , a window appears to be used for selecting the document . the pre @-@ contained M@@ Ã Â¶ s are :
a document can be used either by reason of a new document or the assistant to the quick creation of a new document . more information can be included in this section .
basic users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file has to be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new presentation using an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document , a template using file New will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings ... settings will be adjusted .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variable will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in the document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ F@@ Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that is forbidden in the commands in the editor . as soon as the document has been created , the following steps will be completed :
when creating a new document , the own template can be adjusted instead of the two @-@ hour working .
a template can be created from all &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below are demanded .
&amp; Kate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and her@@ b@@ ness of many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be performed directly from &amp; hur@@ ry ;
to learn more about S &amp; Kate ; and his inheritance should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ ference that can be called for the menu of La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains an Ex@@ ample description nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; used as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with dr@@ unken tr@@ l key to show the &amp; tex ; word means that in this way , click on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drawing the text with the left mouse button , the full text will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can get a share of the source text in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; the must be able to browse the different types of source texts and these results . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assist@@ ants are to be selected . this is an independent type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ tioning are highlighted the jump to the latest or last jumping competition . this jumps is also highlighted in the first input of a character automatically .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions are available for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . among processing stages the following commands are included in the text @-@ selection :
there is a complete paragraph from ( group of lines written on both sides a blank line ) . this extended significance do not connect to the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only noticeable thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the down@@ s are separated by two empty lines .
spread the word under the current cur@@ s@@ position . this selection also has an enlarged meaning as this command also has an enlarged star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to be a part of a part of the document can be found in this first , and by pressing the button C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands this for a faster choice . under processing , the following commands are included for the text of the text :
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to editing outputs .
it has already been clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit environment for a pal@@ at@@ ly simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
the cur@@ sor will be placed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly before the command to open the surrounding area .
this command will be transferred to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to the close of the area .
if the cur@@ sor is found before or within the command \ \ \ { Sur@@ ro@@ unding } , it becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of qu@@ int@@ ed environment @-@ commands can be lost quickly , the most recent environment , so that the susp@@ icious environment structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands which correspond to the processing environment .
this command will be placed at the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the weak@@ ening cl@@ amp .
this command will be placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the welded cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the s@@ lugg@@ ish cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many se@@ al@@ ded groups brackets can be lost quickly on the desired view . this command concluded the last of the last group , so that the f@@ iller structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not tro@@ dden down .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple application mark is used as a gene for use . for the purpose of this purpose it is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple connection characters . &amp; k@@ ile ; this is the case and for two close @-@ to @-@ end guides for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic check @-@ up of the double application characters can be used under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be switched off .
it can also be used as well @-@ specific settings ( e.g. wet or French ) and therefore German or French use . many other languages are available .
when the Shift of Shift ; En@@ ab@@ outs are for &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e. g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close to the internal tables , the actual line with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . this can be added to La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in the tables @-@ environments and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when this tab@@ ulator is not to be encouraged and k@@ ile ; according to the most recent tobacco . although this tab@@ ulator is not the da@@ in@@ ous , for &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate , this is already a good source code , it has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . these modes are available for automatic loading . all these modes can be applied for different work modes including settings .
when starting a new environment with the command of \ \ of { surroundings } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added the \ \ \ { Sur@@ ro@@ unding } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the check box is to be removed , the last letter of the input will be removed and , therefore , the list can be reduced by entering a further letter too .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be found , so that a simple jump to these positions by editing jumps brand brand is possible and the desired parameters will be recommended .
under settings k@@ ile ; insert ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these list@@ ings are to be made . there are various kinds of problems for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as well as well as the recommended language used .
the command mode is not possible for delivery of environments . there are always some letters to be entered with \ \ \ . on the other hand , environments are often used that environments are often used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for loading in environments .
when calling the full @-@ to @-@ end mode or the key element Alt + Shift key , the order to be automatically transferred and it appears to be \ \ ( s ) . afterwards , the environment can continue on the easiest way and can be completed by means of entering the setting .
after all this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile , we know that it is about a lists environment , will even be a first \ \ item command .
under settings k@@ ile ; insert ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these lists . this mode uses the list of del@@ usion @-@ mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; add custom lists of deduc@@ tions which will be replaced by l@@ etting strings . as an example of a cr@@ ushing list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl is used for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L entered and the word promised is replaced by the string of C@@ tr@@ l + Alt spaces , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large , large , not helpful for automatic loading . however , it was found that many W@@ aters are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ ler for all has already been written .
this mode can be set up in volume settings ... K@@ ile los@@ ers can be put down . here you can also set the s@@ welling value for the display of ful@@ fill@@ ment .
details can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / in the person@@ alized home folder . mode is available for an indication ( off ) , dictionary ( W@@ ant book ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialogue graphics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is easy to display graphics , as easy as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the basic view of the basics on the graphics formats should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but we offer an excellent basis for the indications and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is now re@@ arranged , the pages are re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
to understand the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu to create compilation , create converting and creating view .
for the comp@@ ile of the source text for viewer , such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used to be used by pressing alt ; 3 , via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and via Alt ; 5 the PS file will be viewed .
when using the command @-@ construction , a viewer is usually called a viewer after the compilation . should not be built @-@ in viewer , then every time will be a new window .
a new project will be presented by the Men@@ tion Project .... and the following information is required for the project :
when used for the fil@@ en@@ ames window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for the use of EC@@ MAS@@ cript @-@ code . scripts and scripts in the vertical strain are managed .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; yet to be seen .
the first must be said that the space environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite balanced system , in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of different pack@@ ets . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to under@@ wear the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . this includes documentation for the contained pack@@ ets and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete re@@ mot@@ z for &amp; tex ; and it &apos;s not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a fully operational manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as , the Fin@@ ding of the right document is not always easy ; / tex@@ as ; the small application of tex@@ tures , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and hier@@ arch@@ ing a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the benefit is the search for package names or impact w@@ aging . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the space of space available to document the viewer .
&amp; ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor , which can be used on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; k@@ ile ; also available on &amp; Mac ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who offer on the progress of the &amp; k@@ ile ; project aim and offer many hours for the development of tools , which we use all under cont@@ emp@@ t of &amp; GNU ; license to use . current information about the contribution of the bar@@ ber &amp; k@@ ile ; .

&amp; sig is a graphic editor for managing many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures a signal from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read ; by many signatures with different lemon , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily sign@@ boards the same signal from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read ; for every day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you an empty Sign@@ ature ; in the section Sign@@ atures . click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n . in the section Sign@@ atures . click to store your signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click the disk icon .
you may be able to create many signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails privately or profession@@ ally , there is always sufficient signatures .
to delete a signature , select them first and then remove in the menu File or click on the icon to remove the red cross in the tool bar .
open the short commands for menu entries . here you can select a short commands for menu entries , select a promotion from the list . click on the right to the button user defined and enter the new code by pressing the button or key combination .

the 3.2 of &amp; quant@@ um divisions ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ um ; . all these tools use composite as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination makes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has been written , mein@@ pro@@ c and how much it is . we &apos;re still a piece , we give it a graphic surface ! no longer click on a terminal format ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the curved work file , then leave the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of your working folder and enter the folder in the field of other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when supposed .
as already said everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ um Saul , there is now a great graphic user .
if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then simply let them choose the current working folder . if not , then choose the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available .
when it comes to an output on screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ um . , then they let the current file easily be ha@@ unted ; if not , delete the file to the file , select the file to transfer file via other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well , they click the Well @-@ Rec@@ og@@ ue selection .
for using a &amp; D@@ TD , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file selection , they select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; Schem@@ atic Editor &apos;s location . both for &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema and for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG check is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
Oh well , &amp; quant@@ um Saul ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; tool tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the processing file is selected in &amp; quant@@ um ; then it will be marked , then you will simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
enter the name of the file , as the result is called , and the file normally is stored in their home file .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ um number ; themselves may have little to do with &amp; quant@@ um . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found more about it below .
in order to install a Plu@@ gin or a K@@ Part I begin with the menu plug @-@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . add plug @-@ ins without a memory location &amp; quant@@ um . this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often in a project several people work in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ um . by team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email records are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , like both team managers and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look for themselves out of the list of Team Members which he is . this is happening by doing the Team Member out of the list and the button S@@ etze as presses . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears to be bold as you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of your own identity are important in terms of messages and notes . see further information on remarks .
besides the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the collection of members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team leader when something is happening . see more information on more information .
event actions are actions that will be executed if something is happening in the project . one example would be the draw of the open and closing of the project , as much someone has worked , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as it will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see list selected in the receiver list . the ma@@ estro can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in that such heads be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comm@@ ent@@ aries through the following things :
notes to enter is simple . it can be selected either from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by a feature text .
notes can be sent to an un@@ certainty member of the team . in this case , the name of the team member @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the nick@@ name of the Team Sub@@ project Manager , Sub@@ project Manager , according to the enrich@@ ment and sub @-@ project management , should be led by the enriched or sub@@ project name , as shown in the examples below .
nick@@ name and Roll @-@ names are independent of big or small , but spaces for the brackets and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ um Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported by D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ nostic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; quantitative Settings ; -@@ specific settings will be treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be called by settings Quant@@ a ... to be called . This dialog covers some pages that are treated in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ iti@@ zation ; referring to tags , including car , can be changed . entries are :
large / small dimensions of tags : large / small dimensions of automatically added tags . normal / small size means that tags will be inserted as described in day XML files .
large / small size of attributes : big / small dimensions of automatically added attributes . normal / small size means that the attributes are inserted so as they are described in day XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if possible , for tags , for which the final day is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and end @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding single day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during the entry .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ etic types for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the default standard , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other manner as open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be negotiated ) , but this setting will be sent out by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting will be sent out by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup head : &amp; quant@@ um algorith@@ ms , created regularly backup head , so that in a power loss or crash when the next start of the program can be restored , this is not the same as saving the file . it is not the same as saving the file . it is also used for even stored documents according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or a private view ( or the documentation in a Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ v ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings on the default in the next start is useful if the user interface has come through re@@ change of the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages can be used to control the ability of warning through an@@ ha@@ des of non more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . in terms of different modes , see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which depic@@ ts the image of the Par@@ ser knots in the document , can be set in details .
in the scope of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on structural structure with the mouse button .
in the field of structure @-@ tree settings the visibility of the tree at the editing and how deep should be opened automatically with a change in the structure of the structure . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such a element found in the current document .
the area for the application of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded at the processing of a more extensive text . this means , it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ EP , in which the if@@ tests ac@@ ron@@ ym something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are used by the third side which can be re@@ used by each K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following may be specified :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if it is not at a booth like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information will be delivered to the Plu@@ gin at the start , so it can open the current file , the related file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component of the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen .
check the Plu@@ gin : is this activ@@ ates , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ um ; if the given information is correct , then the plug @-@ in is not available if the Plu@@ gin is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ iti@@ vity ; from version 3.3 , trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ oting has been completely redesigned . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger Plu@@ gin was implemented , which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations of plug @-@ ins .
at present , only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ um .
the use of de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plu@@ gin selection box , specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view , displayed in the content of recorded variables . appears usually in the left dock .
a view , where all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions listed . appears usually in the lower dock .
a view , in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown . appears usually in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this promotion , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it divi@@ des the Plu@@ gin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try . this action is triggered by default , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is used , so that normally it does not have to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the leaves according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to introduce a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is equal to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger edition .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and the currently introduced line continuously . if this happens , while the script is continuing , the execution will be continued before a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ try is started , the script will start with the requirement .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information about over@@ growth variables and the current line number . if this is done while a script is given , the execution , as soon as a request is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script , without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next statement in the script , with if possible in functions and include in error .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to over@@ go the instruction and go to the next , as if there were not current .
opens a dialogue , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the aw@@ aking value appears in the variation view .
with this dialogue a variable should be entered or a new value of a variable will be set .

this chapter describes how you can adapt and quant@@ um ; to adapt to your needs and help to increase your needs .
document type E@@ edit packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ um ; it is used to provide support for market and scripts . their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quantitative ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ LER , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and / CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files containing the extension .@@ tag@@ .@@ tool@@ bars are hand@@ ful , symbo@@ lically oriented ly@@ n@@ oses ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can add faster into a document as one user could ever .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , download or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details about transformation .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars permit a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without any danger of a type@@ writer .
day @-@ folder are nothing as a file . you only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folders carry the name of the read @-@ in language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the conference XML and clear whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limitations is placed in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML documentation . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain definition of many tags , but it contains only element type over itself otherwise .
the type of tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( Family 2 )
only valid for meeting class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( Family 2 only )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( Family 2 only )
if yes , the day has common attribute group and the attributes inside this tags can be added to any other day . ( Family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a merely element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it also sets the names and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that may be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes of the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ um ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; quant@@ um ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and methodology . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ ame % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur in an Attribute description only once . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of an tags inside a dialog . this day can occur only once in a dialog ( e.g. for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and the size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a merely element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be closed properly and closed .
space character influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ box &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog can start in &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ Window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check @-@ out only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ um .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this conference XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 conference XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; transition function will be described . the file name of this conference XML file shall be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed by D@@ TD edit D@@ TD . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries will be created :
&#91; General &#93; Version = using 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a promotion can set up action actions ... created . click on New Action to the same dialogue :
the key@@ chain that this action is defined . with clicking the button user can be assigned a button closure ; with K@@ einer is the current key limit .
the most simple actions . a text can be entered in the Det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated Settings and insert this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to modify or use the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; examples are the fast @-@ start dialog or the various See in ... promotions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ one / scripts local script file : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document it is file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ process will be replaced by &amp; quantitative ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ um . from the external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script input can be obtained from &amp; quant@@ um ; on the default input . in the selection box input can be determined , which is to be submitted to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the launched application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal issue , based on the default error . it can be specified , which should be done with the text specified on the standard edition by default :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . in the case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window , starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and if the Tag Attri@@ butes and you plan to plan your use , enable you to edit dialogue &quot; Day &quot; when available , so that an input using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in combination with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; j@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; menu menu ; , graph further programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; G@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; .
in regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a button labeled as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually considered as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will show that clicking on this symbol will be attached ; -@@ day in current document .
after creating the symbol there is still to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; quantitative Population ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue to continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative ; functions for tool bar and it should be shared this to a better overview through some Tren@@ ner into several groups . make sure the tool@@ bar can be selected via settings of tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I &apos;d like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the Elem@@ entary , which is to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the cross @-@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner will support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ bate all symbols to ensure that everything works .
in the proper file . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will create im@@ pedi@@ ments , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar will be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most not@@ orious expansion of &amp; quant@@ iti@@ zation ; for the normal users the ability to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . let the first part we leave you to treat the second .
# K@@ DE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = input 1.@@ html Section 2 = 1.@@ Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.@@ html 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible section of documentation in the document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is such a thing :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = php@@ 4.2 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Ultr@@ ut@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = html @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that it is about sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess set ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
note that the contents are directly refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
space character influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ orts ; Resour@@ ce@@ ases should be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is to be displayed on the frame of the context @-@ sensitive help . by marking the function called and pressing C@@ tr@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c as well as $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Doc@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud of being able to join the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ um affected ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or else to whom . at different places , there is an email address , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; quant@@ um changes ; users can download them and only available if our team needs them as correct and fully used for publication , which is guaranteed to provide a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources are guaranteed , both for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked to demand for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can continue to select one . in the dialogue New resource you need to continue to remain empty ) and then click on the upload of OK .
upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) to upload and upload tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; quant@@ um ; the integrity of the resource due to the integrity and significance . in case of problems , the integrity have been carefully warning . if the integrity have been given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ates of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages which is currently not generated by &amp; quant@@ um . however , creation can be used as time consuming a D@@ T@@ EP package could be necessary because hundreds of day files can be used in day XML format . there is easy way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and convert a D@@ TD . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target range : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definitions shown in the ! doc@@ type Day , such as HTML P@@ U@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / D@@ TD / / D@@ TD / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d will appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , scores &amp; quantitative ; after the conversion to the new &amp; D@@ T@@ EP Editor , the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP may be adjusted ; it is recommended to use this opportunity .
in &amp; quant@@ um Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand these and complete benefits from &amp; quant@@ um ; therefore , one must first bring together with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring to them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and quant@@ um .
in &amp; quant@@ um ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ um .
global elements are available for anyone who is selected &amp; quant@@ um ; it is possible to ensure that in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ um ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user list , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns of up to work@@ pieces with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all the employees within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the man@@ ag@@ gregation , the ant@@ agon@@ ists with information and the tool bars . please do in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the cardboard box with the right mouse button to receive a text menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ v , re@@ charging , er@@ ase or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to current document .
rect@@ angle in the editor range lead to a further context menu on the illustrated document screen , such as basic machining steps ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the text below the mouse button , or open the file , if the string amongst the mouse button is called a file .
at the top end of the editor , the tool bars of the editor are currently taking &amp; quant@@ um ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as a standard , for which a set of tool bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ um , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and thereby linked user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; you want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the man@@ oeu@@ vre ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate in the information about and quant@@ um ; to navigate , to open and walk through . in the presentation of Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; quant@@ um . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project via right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , upload or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the following text menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ iti@@ zation ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : images , program parts , whole website &amp; etc ; there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on the &amp; quant@@ um . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project . read more about templates .
here you can find information on the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script will send or send an email .
with this view , the cur@@ sor will display the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on a element , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and recovery of the tree .
this tree appears among other types of construction . with it can change man@@ quickly Attri@@ butes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the modification of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks can be changed .
here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development . we can download the documentation for &amp; quant@@ um ; the documentation site can be created , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed and viewed .
by default , &amp; quantitative information ; two Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ v in the lower end of the window can be reached via the us@@ her@@ ding information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in quantity of current script . for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to D@@ TD .
this cart@@ on shows all errors in the current document of the current document . &amp; quantitative error ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ um number ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ um .
a further function of &amp; quant@@ um ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; quantitative error ; when they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; quant@@ um ; like any others secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ um ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf can pass a number of options that can be given to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at the starting point of &amp; quant@@ um ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder contains . you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before I am Fol@@ der . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ um Saul ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ um increase ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ equipped development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , developers began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be , if &amp; quant@@ um . an independent , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up @-@ languages editor ? well , this would make him a completely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML , then it should be &amp; quantitative ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; quant@@ um ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; it is not only possible this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quanti@@ fied ; such as they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative gains ; this enables the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase the productivity of almost every task . by means of self @-@ painted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars . through the program comp@@ ost they can understand &amp; quant@@ um . ( more then find them in . )
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for rapid web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developer left the GP@@ L license and produced a commercial program .
more in detailed documentation is with help : / quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; quer@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute help@@ center help : / quantitative a ) .
&amp; quantitative ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not taken on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . check in the section via templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project management board , only an error is reported .
converted to inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; alert , so it is displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ening assignment .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ S@@ ign which is the correct way to insert special characters and space characters in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
automatically switches the recorder to res@@ p . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the Shift + Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the window windows or not . that &apos;s the window , where you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
- and switch @-@ old of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ um . the problem of problem is activated when one changes to the structural tree .
shows the symbol links to the main window . this column allows you to set a bookmark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries predic@@ tive or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
bookmark from other opened documents in the menu , group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ um affected ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialogue to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows for example graphics files in your project file or sub@@ folder and then add to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ um affected ; the project is administ@@ rated . in chapter &amp; quant@@ um , -@@ projects you will find details in detail .
loads a project tool . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialogue to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the name . actions need to set up actions ... added . tool@@ bars are stored via tool@@ bars of tool@@ bars or you are asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removed a tool bar from the view@@ point . you don &apos;t delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you are asked if you want to do that .
thus you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ um ) ; team , thus the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool bar as an app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
download one &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anything else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ um ; own anti @-@ use format .
download / re@@ fresh the Ent@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is sensible if the removal of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP is to be renewed , without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file fails , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific signatures .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; quant@@ um changes ; the inser@@ tion is ref@@ uted when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins listed below the menu listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in .
cho@@ oses the syn@@ tax@@ able mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ b@@ ypass schem@@ ata depends on the works ; -@@ version .
cho@@ oses the type of line identification . very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS , or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external use Ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode that is also the default setting mode , or the lower window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides a entry for each open window . with selecting a contract , the corresponding window will be activated .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ um . major h@@ enna respectively .
the changes in this dialogue covers any application that use the HTML part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
jud@@ ging the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , you can find details .
a dialogue appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which you can change and follow the series .
this should produce an assistance according to the field of the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative percentage ; is a high quality product that freely available and freely licensed , but as in each open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the best of the project , as the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log is used . depending on adjustment of the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local fil@@ esystem into the project . you can select multiple files or folder .
this setting is great if you want to download and change static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ able scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be tied . if a project is redesigned , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
using this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main character and you can make a precise selection of good .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by check or , through removing the hem@@ atology , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also instantly upload the project properties in the menu area in the menu area Profile or with the key short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder are possible ) , which will be re @-@ read on project @-@ related operations like the project folder .
supplem@@ entary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded during opening the project , can be found in more about proj@@ ections .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is available in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the button options . in the trou@@ bles@@ ho@@ oting will be described .
in the lower window profile , high la@@ de@@ profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , po@@ inter a dedicated construction view for each profile .
in the lower window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the lower window event configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions , change or er@@ ase . event actions are executed if a particular event takes place , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ nation opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be used at this moment .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ um message ; closed , the project file will be stored automatically . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project management provides free access to the files in the project . there you can manage files in the current project .
folders are similarly ready , however , the entries must be opening and open with ... within the right mouse button on the following text menu :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of uploaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only longer exists a profile , the button will be blo@@ wn to prevent removing .
the password will retain in the core memory and for@@ getting it . this option is useful if required up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk option does not come in question .
this will stop transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ um cases , many high @-@ loading profiles can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will appear :
this is the name of the server to be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sla@@ ves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this must not be changed unless the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave this is either a time saving function or a danger . do not use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so that it can not be read simply , but each with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text .
a projection view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply di@@ ligence of view , several files and tool@@ bars can replace and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved in the menu project or project tool , can be saved or deleted from the tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ um algorith@@ ms ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but allows to adapt to &amp; quantitative adjustments to its own work .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ um . preferably on the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding itself . adding to the tool@@ bars in the section adding of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be adjusted either by context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which a new tool bar can be removed , tool bar lock or tool@@ bars can be implemented , which can be specified in the dialogue , where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to one action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition , the entries will be removed and action work that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up on them in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set the settings .
templates are essential document@@ ing , code schn@@ itzel and files to link . we can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any part file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any at the system existing directory in the storage room . templates have set in &amp; quant@@ um . in about the restrictions you can set up for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ iti@@ zation ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions on each template prior to use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be included in documents by text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary form ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / URL ) . some examples are found in the storage room under global templates . more information on templates are available .
documents may be written by each text @-@ document type . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . usually , more documents can be found in appropriate under@@ tak@@ ers . some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates . see in more information about the templates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area always will be included in documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the storage room under global templates . see for more information about the templates tree .
as the name suggests , these templates are organized for all the sites as templates . you are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder with a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ um .
shape a document structure to Belie@@ ve ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file As a template .
as soon as it is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the project room under project management .
select text in your document and click on file As a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and put on the site templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough in a single file folder . you can use all the file management functions , such as pulling and paste or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a file in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure a name for the template . by default , it can be saved in the project file , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project management systems enable a very targeted pre@@ ference . you can add head@@ lines and head@@ lines or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; create files , insert files or connected with them . in addition , you can keep some things in the use of templates in projects very pro@@ found in mind .
the template structure in the lower window templates is based on the files in the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / template / template / template / template / template / template / template . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as above .
in order to determine the behaviour of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button to select and in the context menu properties :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ orted , as soon as the ter@@ restrial attributes is inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except for the regular folders in the template . if a regular folder would be enabled , it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular folder .
permits or downstream text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and lines for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p all templates in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , use the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a full command set for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative account ; two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second will execute the editor window in two parts : the source code and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a Curs@@ or appears . then you can edit and activate the source code editor , which are visible in the source code in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor is still necessary to modify this code editor . there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ours .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that , at the same time , the cur@@ sor is activated in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously runs in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor of this mode is already active , the button pressure is the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , whereby the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a . according to choice of V@@ PL ; you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be adjusted automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a great span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the document of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor , as soon as a new document is created with V@@ PL ; editor , which serves as a new document with the V@@ PL editor . this allows for this to change :
met@@ a tags allows storing information on the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows the change of in@@ hal@@ ted , e.g. keywords on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shap@@ ing pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change on the list is possible as with the met@@ a elements . the processing of CSS rules is not yet supported .
it is possible to bind a external CSS styl@@ ing system by selecting the file button and select the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor of the cur@@ s@@ ors is as in a word processing , possible due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves very strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and via back@@ sliding or distances to be deleted .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way about the tool bars as stated in the source code editor . it is necessary to note that the inser@@ tions are not removed before@@ hand , e.g. an anchor day , surrounded by text , each other surrounding anch@@ ors are removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will be used later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , tables or lists can be used in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of breast@@ feeding systems . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ cks , the search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the breast@@ feeding position can be tra@@ ced .

on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can display the arrows keys on / off through the memory memory of the commands to so far .
several commands require more than one argument . instructions can be used to pass assembled expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system &apos;s system . on Uni@@ x or Cy@@ g@@ win systems may also have the name the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for personal folders . on RIS@@ C @-@ OS systems are also allowed additional environmental variables .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously corrected the re@@ tention at the same time . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during merge .
the program used by me could only show me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed inside this lines . and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the obj@@ ection was changed . this changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes on white characters . later , lots of more useful features were added .
if you want to compare quickly text for example , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are working independently from each other on a piece of code and displays changes . in this Editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit three Qu@@ ell files at the merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you in the same and a complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and are similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check the code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in column at the left side . ( no trouble anymore if no one changes the re@@ tention . )
when a file is equal , and the other differs in one row , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily facilitate the file names by using only the file names of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder folder / diff@@ 3 folder folder / diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 @-@ o target folder
opening dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file @-@ browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list . opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to specify a third file . if you do not leave the file for C , the analysis of the differences with two files are done .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a file , the compar@@ isons or merge of folders will be initiated , for B and C , however , is a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file names from A into the two other folders .
when assem@@ bling , the input field is active for the target and can be adjusted . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons / merge .
sometimes you would not like to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparative window . the comparison begins then you can &apos;t select any files you can simply connect the dialog with the break button .
you can also drag and insert : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a reference window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how these functions are , it would have to compare two appropriate files , they get into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare these relevant sections to add , insert and then compare .
note : at this moment you can find out of &amp; to@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out only the text in a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cut and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) . ( if the path is too long for a file , let the mouse rest a while on line . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three sources are the letters A , B and C . A has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed over the Settings menu ) .
if a difference is detected , one sees the color which is different . if both files differ , the pre@@ defined color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( merge ) .
left beside the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the appropriate color . with some programming languages where white characters is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , e.g. white characters are only in strings and commentary , for the processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the digits , where the respective source file is enabled . if the line is activated , the line will be loaded on broken rows .
the result window ( under the comparative analysis ) also has an information line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains all text , but often also contains conflicts .
! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , storing is disabled ! ! ! ( do not use buttons to be found in the lowest / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative holes are used , each difference is to be solved in the same time a conflict that can be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this is also a jump in the position into windows where the group is otherwise not visible . ) This group will be emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for current area and each on the left is a black beams .
sometimes , through automatic merge or manual processing , no further line remains in the group ; then in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the text is shown . this text is not only displayed in the final stored file , nor in a marking you may want to copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge compatibility ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the window window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options are ignor@@ ing or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments are as well as white characters .
this will navigate mainly with the image capture and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can also use the arrows keys on the left , right , at the end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ saf@@ est column next to the vertical screen row can also be used to navigate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to do . with the insert button , you can switch between single and over@@ mode mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the context and the ed@@ itable output window was declared ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down ) or to the next / previous post ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down T@@ aking ) or to the next / previous post ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down T@@ aking ) or the next / previous post as a conflict . hence , between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is activated , you will automatically copy the clip@@ board automatically and the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ching are saved according to the underlying operating system . UNIX variants use a line @-@ in @-@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car re@@ boot \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ up of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored at the next start . ( pop up menu &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a writing with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ic writings are displayed . if the chosen writing does not support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors cannot be available in their pure form but would be shown . on these systems the button settings will automatically set an od@@ d color automatically .
when this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab button . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you return input or return , the transfer of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , any selection will be copied automatically into the clip@@ board . the manual is going to copy in the clip@@ board .
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used option on the used operating system .
when you try to find files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source file . only during this first step , white characters are ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored . also , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a ri@@ pping mark &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , other again save only one line of line &apos; \ &apos; . usually , files can be seen with different sizes in side @-@ side comparison , but then you could only use a white characters . while this option must be disabled , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intense still search for smaller differences . this option is activated in the default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
in the automatic res@@ p mode , this setting is determined , as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next ung@@ ed conflict will continue .
sol@@ ves automatically all conflicts in white characters by choosing the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you need to get better the functions elec@@ le A / B / C for all ung@@ el@@ dest white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection are also available in numbers or comments if the options are to ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning folders and implementation of a merge . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file , this will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of user interface . this option does not affect the current programme . you have to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; termin@@ ate and rest@@ art the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available since the language is set up over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be configured separately for any entry . if you activate this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
the selection fields for the coding appears a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this imp@@ lies how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared with different coding .
if you have selected a file , you can define what code is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre@@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can define the coding of output commands .
switch off to supp@@ ressing any changes in white characters into the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color @-@ coded over@@ clock column are displayed . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is shown next to the normal or second super@@ saf@@ est column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . use the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
the comparison window appeared next to each other or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes look at the differences and then decide to merge the files in the merge menu . a simple click starts the merge and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to rest@@ art the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; to@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example to cut out or correct your own pre@@ ference .
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is only used when the command file is equal . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . every input line has to have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , most users do not want to program this . the good news is , however , in most cases pul@@ sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
in this context , use this pre @-@ processing command to convert : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may be able to understand and perhaps you like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignore of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is well as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ le.@@ sed &apos; s / &apos; &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hits will be replaced by nothing so quasi .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple shots at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the reasons from each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are different at per@@ l some details . where to sed \ \ \ \ \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal Pre@@ processor will maintain and maintain . further operations only change the data that sees the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ Pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with every function , the text changes or differences are hidden , you can not notice any differences in the worst case and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers have to process many files in a folder . you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a suggest@@ ion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can em@@ ulate the merge and display the sim@@ ulated changes without it really ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , uses &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , do not inter@@ fere with the merge , press the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( additional details follow . )
during the reading of the folder you will inform you a small news window over current progress . if you break the folders , only the files are listed , which were compared to that .
when the scanning is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folders found during the scan is found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will normally be folded . you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the building or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right . the directory menu includes two functions of all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories can be loaded with which you can open all folders .
when you double click on a double file , the file will start the same and it appears a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such case the mer@@ ging @-@ up action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this species .
as seen in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries are different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders are the same color . in case of folders , the age is unexpected for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow will be and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B is not exists , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types exist . as long as such faul@@ t@@ less objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B a file is ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ t@@ less objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder was given and if the config file is synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical to that both folders are identical .
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly after merge &amp; col@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be ph@@ ased , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors cannot be removed , the merge cannot be started .
during the merger , a file will display a file after the other . if the merge was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when doing something unexpected , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right in order .
if the setup dialog is chosen for comparative analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of new@@ com@@ ers , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only appear when three folders shall be compared or merged . )
you may either execute the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all together @-@ feeding actions ( even in all sub@@ types ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified the target folder , then in the Three @-@ folders mode C is used as a target , the two @-@ folders will be chosen as a target and for synchron@@ ising A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure , there are some options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to bring all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key pre@@ fix ) . to run only the latest entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if through contradic@@ tory file types , there are still invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ t@@ less elements . you can select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ orted .
select sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without having done really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window ( please note the screenshot ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , select your directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you still have not saved , an appropriate dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of this list you will see some error messages that can help you to ski@@ p the cause of the problem . if you choose the problem to select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you continue with the merge .
if some entries have been assembled individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not be stored at the later together . even if the merge has been over@@ flowing or not saved , these entries are used as done . only if you will change the merge action , these entries will again be merged .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ illing 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that match the indicated pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate samples are entered with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not indicated in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not indicated in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ically produced files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder specifically can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a hiding place attribute . in other file systems this option is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic linking are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is activated in default .
when the option is switched on , the links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links are treated as normal folder and recur@@ sive . ( note that a link to a file that contains a link to itself would lead to a end@@ los@@ se and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is displayed in the default setting .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ stable , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple bin@@ aries analysis , and much slower , if it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files via a slow network , it is possibly faster , only changing date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of safety . please use this option in default setting .
similar to confi@@ dential date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are equal to , if you use the change date lost . please use this option in default setting .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two files are compared and no target folder was given . in this mode , the suggestions are identical . in this mode , the proposals are identical to both folders . this option is displayed in both folders . this option is displayed in default setting .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because it will not verify that the other file doesn &apos;t change . ) This option is displayed in default .
if a file or a file will be replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .@@ original if an old backup file will be deleted with the .@@ original extension file , this option does not only affect the normal merge file , not only the merge file . this option is enabled in the default .
normally , the folder @-@ merge view is visible to the merge of individual files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the window and text window , the main window can switch on the window and switch between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file with double @-@ click navig@@ ating menu . however , you can run a single file also directly together without the folder . if you want to save the file , the status will be closed down and the file will not run once again when you start the folder .
this status is however lost if you read the directory : directory -@@ menu : read more
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders that are opening on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax for local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively . or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file is : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated whether a link is shown on a file or a folder . then it will always be a link to the link target . ( FTP : s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to process per@@ missions or change date . therefore , turn the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please note the option confi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of the purpose is currently as a differences viewer in the Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ illing 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a box , take &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files in the Uni@@ fied format is . then it takes and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . additionally , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the box mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now is it com@@ ely ) there is already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 shows that it can result in such as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GP@@ L programs very long and I have learned a lot when I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or go to it .
you have been compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not indicated the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in the default , configure resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line will not be treated as the same . i@@ F similar Lines . next to Each other , this is this kind of sol@@ i @-@ the @-@ case .
the editor note for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is however lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit a larger quantities of text , another Editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly r@@ ins@@ ed ; No sr@@ c lens ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to emphas@@ ize differences of differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . do not use another editor .
many good ideas and trouble reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes will be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; to@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems at the compilation . if you should have difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out into the clip@@ board and remove the selected text . inser@@ ts ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switch @-@ to @-@ insert ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folder will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder to these options with the function Update . )
there are only entries to feature differences . this also includes that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behaviour is likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed during the button on the button .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . under@@ p@@ ups in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to watch the ongoing programs on the working areas to change their size or move it . this works both in mind and with multiple .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; can display all virtual work areas as well as the ongoing applications . applications can be selected and can be moved on your desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . the movement can be moved within a desktop and other working areas .
the text menu depends on how the right mouse button is clicked on , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ens ; however , the context menu only include the two entries in P@@ ager . however , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on counter and end . the commands will work the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of mind . appears only if it has been clicked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if a application has been clicked on .

&amp; may ; it is a screen saver . you can use &amp; caffeine ; one portion of the screen saver enlarge . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; caffeine ; .
&amp; may ; it is a very powerful application that constantly expands to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you &amp; k@@ mag ; it appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following will this window is displayed as a magni@@ fying window . the image which is shown in the magni@@ fication window is a larger area of the screen and is specified in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter can be found like a moving field . alternatively , you can provide a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse button on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter will be displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse button . please note that the mouse button is still not able to detect the form of the mouse button . this is always the default value ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse indicator .
in the drop @-@ mode mode , you can adjust the select window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse button in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the magni@@ fication body and post@@ p@@ one . this also comes with arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift ; press or press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection box remains firm and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; may ; has a lot of functions . you can send the larger image directly to printer , copy in a file to insert into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stop the updating of the ad . the stops of updating works that the required CPU time is 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , straight , medium , high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected section is displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer pain@@ s in the same place ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and to whom each mouse click pain@@ s . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain , which emerg@@ es with the mouse button , and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer pain using the use of your computer . if you are suffering from the use of your computer , you should not take a doctor if this is not yet to happen .
in order to realise it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain which are caused by the mouse button , it is used against pain , which is caused by the use of the mouse , used as well as with all ergonomic aid supplies : the result can fall for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you interrupted the movement .
if the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating is enabled , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after pressing the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse . in this way , you can execute the pulling when pressing the mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a bit exercise , but you get used quickly .
this delay time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; m@@ ous@@ se tool ; a mouse click is out .
if the opposite is turned on , the turning field shifts ( 1 / 10 s ) is active here . here , the time is set , the mouse button is waiting before the mouse button is waiting , if there is no evidence for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking through the mouse button . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the response time . open the &amp; control centre , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der of sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the relevant documentation to find out how to automatically start a program automatically .
set all settings on the values , which were adjusted when opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button User button , the settings are reset on the stand after the final pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , intelligent re@@ loc@@ s should first be switched off . if you are then used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it &apos;s necessary to reduce the activation of &amp; k@@ de ; in connection to sounds .
first , you should deliber@@ ately make sure to take a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent link . you can use the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse ru@@ ck@@ les , you should clean your mouse . it is usually rather simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that use the mouse ball in touch .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , the mouse is too different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear if you see the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the Lo@@ ches , into which the ball was used . dirt and so@@ iling can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system has started the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when just use a shift operation , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operation does not mean more through the leave of a mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : when you enter text , tries to execute &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute m@@ cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another job .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to make it . however , use the mouse on a neutral range of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse button are un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . safe zones for the mouse po@@ ds are &amp; cover ; the grey areas around the tool bar and menus and the tit@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shift , but I can &apos;t create it to edit text .
intelligent re@@ loc@@ s is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you want to move it into the clip@@ board to move it into the clip@@ board to move it into the clip@@ board to move it into the clip@@ board . but there will probably be some problems with them :
do not use the intelligent shift when you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : perform at the end of the text area a mouse click and hold the switch @-@ down key while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this allows you to play a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the intelligent shift starts . later you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case in most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble cli@@ cks is available only if the system has a sound card and speaker .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; entered the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ unded short . this program was developed for people who are suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and those of the mouse button .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a definite period of waiting for a drawing process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , the drawing can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the dum@@ my users to talk to their computer .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ my users can speak to the computer for themselves . users can choose from a list with the talk of phr@@ ase sentences that will be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen ) , enter the command that later will be used for the text of the text . more details can be found in the description of the description of the text .
on the second side , select the standard word @-@ pass@@ age@@ book . you can choose the word @-@ pass@@ age@@ book . you can choose from the text pass@@ ages without having to type . word pass@@ ages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ lds . &amp; k@@ mouth reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary that only sp@@ ell correctly sp@@ elled words into the Wor@@ lds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly evident and contains basically an input field for the keyboard of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a run memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you are k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear . every spoken sentence is attached to the memory memory . you can select from it sets which are spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog includes two cartridges , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ lds , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice .
in the input field of the box , you enter the command to call the language course . in the selection box below the input field , set the character encoding with the text to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; know two ways to pass the text . select the check box when the text will remain on the default input on the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice output from your language generator depends . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are included in the app@@ endix .
with Pos@@ si@@ can be used as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to further refine the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , the d@@ us@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications is a standardized interface for voice output and currently it is possible in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box promotion , after selecting a text passage you determine what action is triggered by the key@@ word or by selecting a text passage in the menu @-@ pass@@ age@@ book or in the l@@ ath for text @-@ pass@@ age@@ .
with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text passage will speak directly and additionally inserted into the memory memory . the chosen text passage will initially be entered into the input field .
with the second select field closing of the processing tool for the textbook book , you can define whether the textbook book will be stored automatically when closing the processing valve .
with the selection of text pass@@ age@@ book , the book is stored . if you select changes , the word pass@@ age@@ book is not saved . choose from storing , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the textbook book is to be stored .
the site Wor@@ lds contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary .
with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or exp@@ orting the order of the books or exp@@ orting it into a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by deduc@@ tions of the adv@@ ances . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to only insert the written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are led together , and how these weights are to be used .
with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new set of words automatically added to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your voc@@ abulary during the time .
the main range of the window to the processing of texture is divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are represented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding key sequence . if you have selected a textbook book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text pass@@ ages or books add or select text pass@@ ages and books you can either get through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
the order of text @-@ pass@@ ers or word pass@@ ages can be used by drag with the mouse to the new place or with the arrows keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ button change .
the chosen text is cut and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the pan@@ cre@@ st .
the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the pan@@ cre@@ st .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text in the input field is used , it will be used , otherwise the selected propositions of the saving storage .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ved left side and pulling the tool bar to another passage .
if this menu entry is attached is a narrow base in the lower part of the main square with Hin@@ ds via the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is bl@@ ended .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sli@@ dable lam@@ ent for text pass@@ age@@ books with entries will be displayed directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ved left side and pulling the tool bar to another passage .
probably you have given the command for the language version not properly or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the site General Settings and enter the command for the language issue on the card speech output .

in order to show an example of the command line for the installation of the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / freelance . the speech output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard entry . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ o in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / us@@ r / local / oh@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax like the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ;
all parts of the command must be written in a row . the option is required as standard input must be switched on .
the speech @-@ d@@ us@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further voice service provided to all &amp; k@@ de ; uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
because setting up the language course only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to be able to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; it appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
in order to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ not ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can &apos;t speak to spend text by the computer . there will be a list already saved sentences that the user can always be re@@ arranged again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth contains no language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL to the address range from &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of the modules existing service that enables each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer is ready to be equipped with which their applications are equipped with T@@ TS skills . the users also offers interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded .
the speech output is carried out via the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help programme .
in future : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language issue service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
one module for the web browser &amp; cross @-@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file is quite or some can be found .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ au ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) find discussions about h@@ tt@@ ps : / / email / email / email address . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Channel # k@@ de Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set properly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speaker is set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the card details will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , so also different male or female speakers , or such a combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , sex , volume and speed is called speaker . you should use at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the standard speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise .
various actors for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to the same printer for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed automatically , when you start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
in a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
in a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system apply .
choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a jun@@ gen@@ - and girls stand for selection .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ man appears on the cart@@ on card . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; for almost use . go back to the map of General and check whether language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text and manage to manage text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map cards of General to open this cart@@ on card . here you can set some general options .
mark the check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start is successful , the card orders will be shown and you can create text orders and read them . see . remove the marking , the K@@ TT@@ SD is activated and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field of speech is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , dis@@ appears as soon as the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start text orders , stop and hold back again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board read or read a text file for pre @-@ read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on App@@ ear or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map cards of General and cross the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . select the text , which should be read and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can jump this step too , but then many &amp; HTML ; head@@ lines and other invisible brands will also be read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ au , you can read the text editor . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . check the text , which is to read , and select the text of the text .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications are embedded , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative ; .
K@@ Not@@ ification is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you can be noti@@ fied of you by set up events . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; for example , you can set different types of messages . you can be noti@@ fied if you are noti@@ fied in a IR@@ C channel , where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ ification , will appear a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . here , the possible settings for the Not@@ ification will differ according to application .
filter for drawing tools offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b of the messages , the k@@ mail sent , and also the print@@ out / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed for most cases as assuming . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not necessary .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker to handle certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the mode of filters , it is important to know how the program works &quot; No @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the Screen reader is read , the received orders will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has prec@@ e@@ dence and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resumed after the issue of warning .
News have the next priority priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text can be read on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome you just enter the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text@@ orders . each order that allows you to attach from the board card orders , is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text orders . text orders are thought for the output longer than the issue , which have no special delic@@ acy .
all four order types are working in qu@@ eu@@ e @-@ long , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends out the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such reads , this edition will pause and ended .
first you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ids . they are applied on normal war@@ nings , news and text agreements as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News applied .
the filter process the text and specify it to the next filters . currently there are three types of filters .
filter are implemented as modules . in the future , there can still be more kinds of filters .
replace parts of a text by other text . the required parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions . it is provided with the pre@@ defined character string profiles , which enable the correc@@ t@@ ness of messages from &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; included in a format into a different format . there are some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaking options , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice on the board card , you can read text by K@@ DE news about it . read about it .
each of these different filter has been adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a language issue . if the filter is determined that its rules does not exist , he will continue to follow the text to the next filters .
if a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent , it will be arranged by all activated filters , which have been installed on the page below . the processing of the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be changed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ esystem , and there will be shown below the following introduc@@ tory di@@ alog@@ ues .
to set up a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative sample , these samples are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the appropriate replacement text . big and small case will not be considered by comparison .
enter a name for your filters . you can choose one of these filters to distinguish it only from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column . the list is displayed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store the current list or delete . download a list of a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
here is a language entered , the filter only is applied if the speaker for the text contract is one of the here registered languages . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also hold multiple languages if you press the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button .
here is a value registered , the filter only applies if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can set multiple programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you will receive the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must notify you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 allows you to copy only copies .
only then applied to the text if all conditions are applied with one entry in the box Di@@ v Filter if you agree . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character set filter regular expressions used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words need to be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( space characters ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no guide to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; code &amp; # 160 ; code &amp; # 160 ; list &amp; # 160 ; exclu@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into a different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be installed on well @-@ known XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c relief program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the ch@@ anc@@ ill@@ ary filter you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the board card speakers , or to a speaker with certain features . you can define the text by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filter passes , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is presented with the speaker properties that gives the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the board speaker pair speakers . you can write the chosen speaker on the board card .
here is a value registered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . it is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; assignment installed , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to initi@@ ate the regular expression in the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
please insert here the characteristics of your talk . if the text shown above showed filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements at the earliest . click on the button to display the dialogue options selection .
use these buttons to store or delete your speaking settings or delete all settings .
the ch@@ ill@@ ary filter will only apply to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ v Filter if you need to apply at least one condition .
the language issue API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications to T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that it can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Interface of speech @-@ API from &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand for voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program of the object of the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text is text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all orders you will give
open two &amp; console ; window . start only kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ file filters , but when using module for the festival are not read pages .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so able to use S@@ able at all . if you do not have to use this voice to pre @-@ reading websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H to be found .
certain characters or interest characters appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that the phr@@ ases should ski@@ p or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ ve . what can I do against it ?
first make sure that the character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be fixed by a character locking filter . see .

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of the above languages may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , use the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; for information which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; No @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you &amp; kt@@ ts , you would like to extend for the use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the designer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but transformation filter is not necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the developers files for the &quot; No @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts of &amp; kt@@ ts ; you have downloaded the Tar@@ ball from the source repository for any of the night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if you &apos;re working properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . for this purpose , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is intended to be developed so that the device can not be used directly and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will be dismant@@ led in individual sentences . the user may go back or decrease in single sets , repeat the output or break off .
if an application is written &amp; kt@@ ts , it can request for example a female English speaker for example . if you have a speaker , the language of English and its gender is female , it will be automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker is chosen , see you in .
when you click on the cart@@ on card speaker , then click on editing or on the Edit menu , the card speaker is displayed . as an example , you will find the module for festival interactive . details about the modules can be found in the following details of the module .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable events program . if the path comes to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in case of votes , the &amp; kt@@ ops are known , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a regulator and display these grey , the settings are not chosen by you .
some votes such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be loaded with multiple seconds . if you mark this check box , these voices will already be loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first proposition is syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet furnished any speaker ( or do not forget to click on ) .
if this check box is marked , the program window window frames are indicated . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol sm@@ sm@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to show the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as the TT@@ SD is read a text . thus , you have the chance to stop or select otherwise .
here all orders are listed in the qu@@ eu@@ e , along with the application that set the order to the current status of the application , the number of sentences and the just worked sentence . the speaker ID equals the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can get a full @-@ pass in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not any order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card maps ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component is not selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , it can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here .
set the microphone rate here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on user to use the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this cart@@ on card you can address special promotions , which will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech contracts :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the edition of the Screen reader has been read , the received orders will be resumed .
warning have the next priority priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resumed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just send a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you enter the room .
if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a Screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; audio output into the qu@@ eu@@ e for a long time .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text contract is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound is active as the introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory news .
the settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars there are no special promotions when these are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the Not@@ ification messages , start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the card noti@@ fications appears .
mark this check box to switch the read &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Not@@ ification . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
is this setting marks , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the conversation and conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this selection box to establish what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event takes place . you have the following options :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired microphone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . for a particular event of a specific application , this is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the specific application . as the last option , the action takes up to the Tra@@ gen , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event of all other events cannot be deleted from the list ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list below :

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for the control of voices , the talk speed , the volume of the voice and pitch . also brands for control of pron@@ unci@@ ation for example . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as it is the default language that uses the festival at the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or pitch may not be set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two kinds of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , I can read off the first proposition as only the first proposition should be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text contract . in this way , you can also return on the card orders a full @-@ pass or jump , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support them directly .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal filters . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts are automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ positi@@ onal filters , but will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
at the easiest way , you can easily read the selection of the talking selection and enter text for example . check out the spre@@ ader selection , change some properties and check out how to have the choice of talk . for this purpose , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first movement can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then get text orders then on the card card orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal sat@@ z@@ lim@@ it@@ ry filter will automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , but do not change anything at this filter , unless you know what you do .
the text form and text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a t@@ amp@@ oule sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limit ( t@@ amp@@ oules are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal filters re@@ tains the strings .
S@@ BD filter has never been applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( cold ) , warning , messages , or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filters , you can add this again by calling the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map @-@ up menu , you can write the talking settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the cart@@ on card ) . in other words , there will be no speaking properties .
use of the most suitable spokesperson , which has all the features of a furnished microphone . if you select the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is taken out . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the spokes@@ man , who is the most originally set @-@ set features .
select the method for entering the desired talking properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
select here the characteristics of the desired talk . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box when the property is intended to have other features . you can also set up several markings here .
as the language is a critical factor for understanding , it is always possible to specify this property . the only case where you might specify the attribute language , if you know that a certain application will be sent in another language than that of the working environment .
to use all the properties in the field speaker , use the most likely to delete the following image , please click on the select button and then to the nar@@ rator , which corresponds to the most .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text contract in the waiting line . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , the input is required ) .

on the card audio , there is a setting speed . thus , this works , the program SO@@ X must be installed and on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ als such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when &amp; m@@ ts ; &amp; HTML .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . at many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German votes are subject to limitations at the transfer .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; control center ; which allows the administration of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; control center ; allows users to manage a series of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings about a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; control center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ control@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to allow the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; col@@ control@@ center will be displayed . network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device ever displays and setting up the network features .
in most cases device drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be re@@ loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the &amp; control center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings the module tries to automatically detect the platform installed on the system .
if the platform can &apos;t be detected , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from list which is best to be taken permanently . due to the setting of the setting , non @-@ re @-@ questions can be taken permanently . at the next start of network settings then this selection will be automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means , the settings can only be considered . in the system management mode you can click by clicking on the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out :
the settings attached network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface ... in the dialog device can be addressed .
by default , only the TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button Extended Settings shows the dialog with incoming possibilities .
with the selection of automatic TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server , all required TCP / IP information on any system start , so there &apos;s no further adjustment required . in the selection list may either select DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selecting Manu@@ ally , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made to the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address you need to specify the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is fixed .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alized the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization will not be desired , this option should not be activated .
the values specified in this dialogue are displayed as properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . ping up an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping into the &amp; console , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch @-@ off of an switched network device is done by selecting from the list and click of interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch off an activated network device is selected by selecting from the list and click of interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical link to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if there is more than a network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the net , where the gateway computers is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if computers h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is required , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name resolution allows simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed or modified . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single contract , or down to the list with the buttons or down in the priority .
by clicking on the button add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog for New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be included in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution choose a entry and then click on the Edit .... It will display the dialog .
the list of well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the computer @-@ to @-@ IP address reference to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace the DNS server .
normally , the list of well known hosts contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . these are still available in the review of IP in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar hosts and click on adding .... The dialog of New also is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button Add . if the well known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , turn button adding several times and enter the other also known as names .
select an entry @-@ known computer screen from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit the calcul@@ ator is displayed .
there can be one of the following tasks , then with clicking on OK , the list of the static hosts will be updated .
the settings defined in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , in one &amp; console ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package to download and in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical surface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are required .
this is only recommended to re@@ comp@@ ile users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should afford this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second , all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endix , only basic information about integration of the PC will be medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv4 ) . this description has never been found great distribution . IPv6 is expected in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is to be aware of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator , which is a valid IP address , or if available , dh@@ c@@ CP can be used . definitely , the IP address can not be chosen .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP address counter with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded during the Internet , so its use is possible .
of course , you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the mains mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all machines are at the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for IP transfer .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this section , the configuration files located by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed with DSL connections , so it is not surprised to find any content specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can therefore occur as expected .

&amp; dat ; is a safety program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for tar which offered my wife . the second goal was the answer of a question that took my wife : how much longer lasts it if you set ?
before a band can be used , it must be made by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat ; trained the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; dat ; the pron@@ unci@@ ation on the tape will not be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted .
recogni@@ zes &amp; dat ; the preliminary index , search for the appropriate index on your record . can &apos;t be found , if the tape index should be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol of the tape drive , to show that the tape was in@@ bound . in the Status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the ban@@ des can now be searched for the tape through un@@ folding the entry for the band .
before dis@@ card the tape , first the integration process must be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; gives an amendment to the symbol for the tape that the integration was solved by the band and shows an appropriate message in the Status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger .
before a volume of &amp; dat ; it can be used by &amp; dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
one band members need to form@@ at@@ ted before you need to be used to store data . this process does not comply with the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the tape by &amp; k@@ dat ; it is usually necessary to form@@ at@@ tain a form@@ att@@ ing of the band &apos;s tape , DA@@ T drives cannot be used .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape is lost automatically ! after completion of the formation process , the tape will be connected automatically and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you need to select the c@@ auti@@ ous files . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or file in the local file tree . it will only secured this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . it only secured the files specified in the profile .
mark files in a local file tree with a HÃ¤@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
click the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sich@@ uan ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue , you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be selected to select the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives for the band with a HÃ¤@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry test ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog settings will be displayed for verification . in this dialogue , you can check your selection once and change your working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can restore the restore , the files you need to be restored , this can be selected on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . it will only be restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a HÃ¤@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are recovered .
click on the right mouse button to a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu button ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialogue you can check your selection once and change your work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is considered necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the band@@ in@@ hal@@ ed . this process is del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this includes a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can set up the following settings for safety profile :
the current working folder where the backup should be done . the list of c@@ auti@@ ous files will be updated automatically according to the preferred working folder .
for all folders such as backup files are listed , that only the files are listed in the same file system , such as folder . file , which are on other file systems , can be submitted separately under backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independently from the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file is used , which has changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to specify changes since the last in@@ cre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes that all files are secured and a new snap@@ shot file is used for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be set :
the complete path for the device node ( normally / dev / Tape ) is required for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ pro variant of the tape .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is in@@ bound to the drive . in some drives this is necessary to be done before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , tries to lock &amp; dat ; this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , it is automatically over@@ thrown the tape . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; dat ; the hard@@ disk block size for tape drive is enabled . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; dat ; in any case the block size is required for your tape drive .
when &amp; dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only support a memory block on the band . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Â° ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , whereby computer name is the complete name of the system , which has been form@@ at@@ ted on the tape . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the ep@@ och that the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar - archives that can be used directly with &amp; GNU / - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup range . this icon is only active when a tape is bound .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocol . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information on your system or where the system can get information on your system or where the system allows you to access the different protocol files . moreover , I have enabled &amp; ks@@ ec@@ log ; experienced users for quick access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information on your system or where the system is stored on the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ander log ; experienced users for quick access to information on problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; tries to provide some advanced functions that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , press log log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different kinds of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , set &amp; ks@@ ec@@ log ; functions available , with their assistance the single protocol lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort . the individual options for s@@ orting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; ks@@ ander log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - system log log ; it will be open to you and it opens under Linux normally in folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the specified strings . in the default setting , select the select box next to the filters all . then a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contain the strings of the filter search .
you can also select another entry in this place , and then select a column of the filter search , then select the column process in the accordingly selected column . select the name of a process , so it shows &amp; ks@@ ec@@ log ; all protocol lines sent from this process or were created .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocols . protocol @-@ lines of level errors will be displayed using a consp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of level Note . the colour display of protocol lines can be shut down dialog .
if you want to view only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can see the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to check the output of a certain command such as the launch of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to new lines in the context menu of the main station to view all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; allows the display of several protocol files into separate sub@@ du@@ es . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open additional sub@@ window and manage . once you have selected a window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; has its own website on h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ ysteme log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find further information about the information sources of &amp; ks@@ ha@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ysteme log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archive : ks@@ ysteme log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V in@@ it system develops rapidly to the standard for control of the system starts at the start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( among others , because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to upgrade a machine on System V in@@ it without a new installation and re@@ form@@ work . this is why you need to make sure the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was there .
the SY@@ S@@ V in@@ it also differs from BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you would like to start on another Run@@ level . system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only be launched . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should also be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it &apos;s actually not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ conf / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and it starts the first to find it .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and likely to change that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 . if you want to change this , then you can repair / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , then you can repair it by using the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called to the argument . if it includes a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people wish a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level server , which can only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; you could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say no tri@@ vial : simply pull a entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also modify scripts between Run@@ lev@@ eling or modify the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only do not occur if you pull out an entry from the area of availability system services .
note : entries are moved , if you want to copy these in a new field . to copy them only to a new run@@ level , you need to add them out from the menu Edit or from the context menu - even then , if the same entry already exists in the target range of action .
the s@@ orting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such case you need to edit the s@@ orting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries , which were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to enable the various work@@ areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of upper or below .
to move a entry into another Run@@ level , turn it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired round level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ter number or the name of a single entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by pressing the key button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before being executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; re@@ produced . changes to the settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ els , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; col@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , does not simpli@@ fies the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are required ( and even if you are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) can easily end without notice when their configuration files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send us information about Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it &apos;s enough to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you have to save this . either you use the corresponding icon of tool@@ bar or entry to the menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two Kart@@ ell cards , user and user group . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears a dialog user or group Properties .
some cases can only be displayed if you have enabled system settings . only if you can make space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cart@@ on card can be set on which you can make individual settings , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed .
the card password will appear if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD , are installed .
this card card only appears to be activated and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file size limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for every user parameters , the space restri@@ c@@ tures can be changed in KB :
these parameters can be set separately for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the field of field fil@@ esystem .
the map groups inform@@ s about the Group &apos;s underlying values of the selected user . the default group , to which the user is , will find in the field of prime group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting this in the big field .
the dialog features of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click the matching add @-@ button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analogue .
with this module you can add the li@@ lo boot manager , remove the boot word , remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change , change , change and more .
