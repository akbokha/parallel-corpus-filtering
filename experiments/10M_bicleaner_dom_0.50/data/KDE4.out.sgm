<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you have to maintain any system in contrast to data structure. your image files must be arranged on your computer. you must decide whether to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run & etc; Beware that you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday images can be found rapidly over your location. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files and you will not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of data types makes stacking processing easier. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies securing strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to activate the metadata in & digious; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written in the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently add the metadata of the database into the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what if you want to change? there is a metadata Editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you need to select any photo passwords, labelling and evaluation. of course you can select all images that need the same attribute and then start the value. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best pictures.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us know now with keyword, keywords, how to continue with other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you have cataloged images from another source with embedded jars, then & digipses; automatically insert the tree for you, then add images to the right place. the Changing of Hierarchy is not done within the tree. the modified topics will be done by & digious; updated while keeping the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are all of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to labels or comments using the third important tool to catalogize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to just see most of your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it closer, then you will start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! it starts to dream, associations, the historical period is again present, you might even hear the silence. so you can see your perception this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others, the title is possibly more important than the image itself to produce an interest. if you are showing pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him about the motive that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only to work for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious; you can store any text in an international alphabet (UTF-8), and you can even export your images in web-galleries, then these labels will be exported according to your wishes into the labelling and / or the title of the Web-GaleriesSystem.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a bored planet before Earth? well, because with pictures the train from the spatial presentation is now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolism are already innumerable and are still going to be deeper into the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can download the photos at the entrance site. you can also download the photos at the entrance site. you can also export the pictures at the entrance site. you can also export the pictures at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the interior page of & digipah; as information should be deposited to:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for educators and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographers, for example to protect the photographers name, then the name of a company or organization can be used. after which this value was saved, he should not have changed any more. this field does not support Commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (Synonym for Writer Line): associated with the author. examples of this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples for this can be title as: employee photographer, Free photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the authority, this also must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (Synonym for Provider): use the Anbieterfeld to identify who offers this photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then this organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a bearing picture, the group / Agency will be displayed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not offer protection against abuse. anyone who have a little more than basic knowledge is able to delete or change. the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. & digipens; will be available in the near future such module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, turntables, blackout, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disintegration, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs on the street or a fire. this type of losses are the same which you can pass through traditional paper pictures or negatives. this section is about problems in the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has the reasons a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated as a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archiving quality, you can also get more difficult and more expensive. there are offers on Gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe this is in your measurable space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can store good discos and good recording devices. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheap, but you're writing much reliable. so it's the right to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable for errors even if you just have been written only. therefore, they use a control plot mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection they use chemical aging, ultra-violet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a reasonable program called IsoBuster that works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not available for Macs. there is also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to store the format War against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything about CDs and DVDs was also true for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-quality media. read then the media with a description, date & author code and then in a clean, dark dry and in front of animals protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read this media or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's manufacturer include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: disk is missing</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: discos will keep the longest error rate. by lower temperature control, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART can not notice the impending failure. these are in particular reading errors and shift counter. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is a complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally reset without any big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not much account, these can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high-speed processes, complete data loss, hardwareage, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against power grids is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of the energy heat absorbs and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. however, it is usually included in the form of a plug-to-voltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a specific minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects protection against lighteners and protects the right connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since a cable can use each cable to your computer, you should also ensure that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage cables that include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specifically designed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection protects your system against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of indispensable data. it can therefore be meaningful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overtension, these tools can automatically add battery power when a power loss occurs. some models allow them to be able to run up until current. when you purchase a USV, you should be sure that they might meet the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare his safety at power disorders with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think that your computer is so good for you to drink all cables before you go to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service provides S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as your backup destination for your software. Google Shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities on data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com makes online storage services available on photos. your free storage is available to you in full resolution online. the professional version offers you more at your disposal, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you will get unlimited storage that should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, web solutions are very secure. data transmission errors are automatically adjusted for adjusted and with the large firms it is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory. therewith, they are desasterproof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to data transmission errors. data file system and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one occurred when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection for that day. no one seems to be thought of your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to be thinking about it. the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer data set than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are another source of transfers, as they generate interferences within the data flow. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you're not particularly affected by transfers problems, you should see in the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seem to be one of two candidates that can be handle and highly scalable. it's open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is also available for & Linux; and Windows is available soon. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that these two factors are responsible for 86% of the losses in notebook and 46% at worktop systems. in Notebooks, the proportion of steels is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the meiosis. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; nobody had been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of investigative processes during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and final result. even DSLR cameras have a limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk can be found today for 100 & euro; so do not make it any other for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss. so you insure your data frequently after one plan and test this backup before you do anything like the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange plates or size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected during the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A Desaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. forget aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect all the space or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterction means a non-local storage. bring your sickle up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a moment of a moment without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete system. this creates a complete moment of momentum on two points: the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: one backup of the files have been changed since the last fuse. this creates several moments at any time. you can restore the original status at any time again. this backup comes with a versioning system on the next with the exception that it is only shared and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily install on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer transcripts, rsync only the difference of files actually changed. this happens uncompressed and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup key images directly after you have saved on your computer on a DVD or another optics medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you come to a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment of work for at least one month and a moment of moments for each month. each additional dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, associated with IPTC information, associated XMP files, original memory, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images on the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that about the period of time you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unforeseeable because of your nature. unfortunately, there is no other way to leave with caution while the time flies. unfortunately, there are no other option to be used as certain wax. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to reading your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out, which you have to have the scalability with the area and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and close to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command, whether your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read more, then you can create these themselves. this task is simpler from year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. it should therefore no longer use.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard developed by GIF. however, it can save much more. it is loss of loss, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. however, the downside is that it is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would like to save you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can store your images in this format. however, there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed and open shell file format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camera controllers are now available now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. the file information will be specified using the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it before an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, it can be archived separately for the link between the metadata and the image file and as above already notice is the raw format. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core metadata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application purposes and business models. to the activities of DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarified efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as pictures on the camera's camera, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your personal archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine processing, you can use external programs. if you return the pictures again with & digial. edit, then you should add the metadata. these were cut under circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgalleries, use in MPEG, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digial. in the section adding a photos to an album you can add a description as you can already have on your hard disk, but you can add many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the computer, turn the camera to display mode and turn it. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this is trying to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig indicator can be displayed on the lower end and the front images of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras are not available. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol of the file order will appear for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information on any entry. with the lateral features and metadata of the camera-interface you can see the characteristics of a single entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue displays file properties and the photo information that are internally stored on the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that with some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata shows the internal metadata, such as EXIF, manufacturer of manufacturing, GPS, etc. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digial; or the image processing. note that these metadata will not be available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is click on the button to download and then the selection of all. this invites all photos of their camera into one single album in & digious;. at download the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to delete pictures of the camera before you delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all of the photos, you can only choose the desired selection methods of & kde; select the photos selected, use the button to download and then select selected. the knob chosen is out as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available to download. these images have been downloaded yet not by & digious; download. in this case, the new pictures are downloaded from a star in the front window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the buttons of all, a dialogue with which you can select the destination, displayed in the photos below. the list of existing albums will be sorted as usual folder. details on the folder version can be found in the section of my albums. then choose the destination from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have chosen the target album, press OK, and & digious; invites the photos of the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them out of the camera by using the button delete All erase. if you only want to delete some, then you need to select this first and delete delete dischosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to restore photos from the camera. they should not be careful if the photos have been successfully deleted in a & digious; -album you should be careful if you want to extinguish them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera memory, you should make it much faster than the camera name, since that is substantially faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names. this can lead to double file names in the same album. so it can be useful, the date and time, at which the image has been made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors the image and for the data base. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the broadcast will open three other options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information into the IPTC field. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want another date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. then turn the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the Camera filenames option, you have the possibility to change the filenames in lowercase. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug; for a photo, is displayed below the name displayed the camera in preview. your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digipens; can all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording to perform an automatic turning during the heredity. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section bar Metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and when your camera does not supply these information, & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic turning off, use the button extended and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is made about the date where the photo was made available, & digious; this sublime is based on the picture data. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subtitle. not all cameras are available in the same subtitle. not all cameras can be found in the same subtitle. in the page strip Meta-data you can read what information can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in that case stores & digipens; photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to fix this option. use the button Extended and select the option-based lower than the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their hosts on their camera is the button Download. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files that can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you where the images should be uploaded. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means that a position is meant by the US GPS, the Russian GLONAS, to the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographs an area by automatic uptake of GPS data to kartographic. Umweltplanner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a browser to another & digious. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digious; users want to document the site of the photos, or simply document this aspect, it's good to connect the position of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data into the image? first you should know that exiv2 are many GPS data fields, such as the data in these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last about manual setting of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there is a few who work together with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you need to save these data in the GPX format as it is the only format that is supported by the module for geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signalling code names that can be created e.g. from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street species. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="284">This promotion can be selected on embedded preview or image processing. they set up the standard behaviour of & digial; firm when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacity and copyright data. these data are written automatically into the respective IPTC data fields, if the option is synchronised to download from the camera monitor. this data is also written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for author: this field should contain the photographer's professional photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the car field it must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for vendor: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author as well as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here. if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group or Agency should be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions store the data into the respective IPTC rock. thereby, the metadata is permanent and not only included in the database of & digial. these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & digious; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, which can also be read from other images. attention: for images that are already contained in pictures, these are overwritten by the & digious.</seg>
<seg id="290">The site settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer will rest in the main window over a file. depending on the chosen option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats and audio formats. to prove, you can add the file expansions of this list and remove. any file in one & digicame; Albumfolder, which has no of these enhancements, will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the knocking right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light from & digious; can be switched on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. this option & quot; in the whole image size of ladenquot; if you have one, then you can get better access results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can choose this here. you can use the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be selected with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this review can be switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Using Chroma-subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the next statement.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression mode, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG requires a quick-loss algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value on a high compression. in this case 1: a low and 9 provide a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file compression, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the deflate algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can save losses free. even if you were written the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digious; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard measure is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light than the pixels at odd rows, this difference is a bit soft, eliminates this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 Gittering pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the camera is used to use camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance, based on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors the effect can get more details in four steps more details in peak power. for other cameras, this option will ignore this option.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-light, so the parts of your images are on display the top-hand white in the settings. the setting colours generates some exceptional results since it shows the top speed in various rosatys. lastly, you can try to redesign some parts of the missing information from the valents.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. & dcraw try to redesign the missing green and red shares in the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set up a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminous value according to your taste. you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the default 1. but this can also be made in the image options of the & digious; image processing is done too. to keep the time for the demo field, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosafield algorithm is a digital imaging to calculate a complete image from the part-filtered image sensor that produces many cameras and that is known as a matrix color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipah; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. according to some tests it has been used as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm that used by me. Bilinear is interesting, if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color of your lentils, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be carried out during the shell.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and are instructions as these should be given. there are also LCMS and & digipments; information like the color information from a color space in the other to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavioral questions, if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile file Sing here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digiplug; the folder examines during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC-profiles you have here the opportunity & quot; default value for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Input profiles should be used for the camera manufacturers and model you need. not all profiles are produced on the same type. currently, there are some examples such as Canon, which does not need any color mapping or Gammacorrection. this means that you do not need to carry the color command itself for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft Proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could manually correct, instead of leaving on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is planned for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this response is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile Extension can detect the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for neutrally, P for neutrally, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image analyses and image workings supported. many modules support, which were written in order to work together with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are loaded by & digious; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main seat and beyond. furthermore, you can also see some also in the context menu of the pretext menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Shorthle for tasks that are carried out of modules can be set to set up settings in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) over KIPI modules you can get through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusted the time between the image passes, usually 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes on metadata is one or off, which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during display.</seg>

<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can place the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field will only be active if you have chosen a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you'll have to specify the path, / mnt / camera, or / mnt /</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer to put them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digipcame; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can manually set camera models and port manually. after you set your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the trashcan display, you can set the conversation of & digious; when deleting a photos in an album. find more details about the deleting of a photos and deleting of a album.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be tackled by & digious; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the Welcome Screen Saver & digiplug; when starting with Starts, this will accelerate the start process of & digial.</seg>
<seg id="334">The start to search for new photos are forces & digious; the basic folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digial. if something from the base folder was deleted, & digipcame; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digious; used to adapt the main window to your taste. these settings can select below settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be seen below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple textfiles. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; you will find further information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digious; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to the correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by selecting the entry menu / editing menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digious; so they are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">One menu bar at the upper edge and including the toolbar for quick access to the most common features.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing changes your photos. none of the functions will however change the original photo before you have used Save or the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't restore the original photo again as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should therefore possibly start a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save with file stores.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring the image processing and restore the button to restore the image processing into the tool bar. you will then lose any change that you have carried out at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any promotion of image processing can be reproduced or restored. the last promotion can be reset, retrieve and re-manufactured by editing editing and restore them from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should use the keyboard abbreviation, Ctrl; -z to reverse and Ctrl; -switch-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you press the & LMB; you will receive a moment longer in the toolbar or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a text menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are also made in the same way or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image processing, you can easily move between photos in the same album or same keyword by using the image buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image runter or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom-out in the photo and you can use Ctrl; Mausoleum or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the Esc key. in default, you can change this in the setup dialog by & digious; change this window. see this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual pictures or entire propositions. you only have to select images with the default methods and select from the menu album Export printing assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation devices, even in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear, or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can add labelling with unlimited size or insert. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labelling are copied to EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have comments on, use either the button user or change to the next image, which are stored then.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which will always be written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorcerations. it can be used either by a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortage Ctrl + 0... 5. the rating from the sidebar will always be used on a picture. in order to evaluate more images simultaneously, select these from and use the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the encoding is followed by the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box to filter words, the jworries and a selection box with the previously available in this & digial session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adjusted dynamically to the given search word. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering the keyword in a picture series. if you have posted different jwords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can also be set up by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all tags of a picture will be stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be used on the highlighted image and not applied to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar sample filter is used to change the selection of the main window displayed in the main window. usually the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, jector and searches. if additionally one or more jute filter out of the right side will be displayed only the cutting volume of these two. all passwords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and pull off. suppose you have selected several pictures to be provided with keyword. if the keyword exists already, you can simply draw it out of the right side bar and place the selection. then a dialogue that asks you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the jigsaw is on no sample, which was reduced to three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a and then, a keyword from the right hand side was drawn and put there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will be held at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or later, you can easily change this easily with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to which in the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or character string, which is already in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this job. I used it mainly on & digious; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one is using a color-administered workflow, you can achieve a predictable variation of your camera or scanner. with a color-administered workflow, you can achieve that the colours are using your camera or scanner. you can print or publish the colors on your digital dark chamber from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on color management, everyone wants to express what buttons he must press for the results that he would like to provide informed decisions at any point of image processing work. the sense of this tutorials is to you provide sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, you will receive links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image sequence meets all of the criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are via e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works well and the life for all so easy, why should you use another colour space and make your thoughts on color assets?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeons region, and the colors in the sRGB space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB using some bigger farms, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to worry my monitor if I have decided to work only in the sRGB space space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB space space, as sRGB you will have to close your monitor. if you are working as the color space of sRGB, you will need to use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available, which can improve a picture in most cases. use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, final, Automatically and contrasting the menu corrections automatically from your colors to make the best. they will be experimenting with these effects, to see what is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the characteristics of the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colour shaded. this function is often a lean correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same method is adjusted to the luminance factor of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity difference is as flat as possible. thus, this is the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in one image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusted the red, green and blueprints on the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the shift of the lowest and highest levels of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digipcame; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white-like photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8-bit per suit. if you can do so far from the original image, you can do so far from the original image, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-balancing algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start the menu entry colors white and image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image is also adapted to the preview of the tool. if you want to see the preview of the tool, if you want to see the original protein bar, then click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram is displayed as soon as you can change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be indicated. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and Gamma. the shadows Adjustment lets you improve the shots of your photos or down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above inspections, you should use the colour temperature-pipette. press this button and then click anywhere on the image preview for the correct colour temperature of white balance. this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white-down with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The predictive dictator increases the colours when more than a colour channel of pixel pitch is displayed. this will be displayed as a pure indicator as pure indicator, and does not have effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons stores than and store accurately this. every setting of white equates you have set to store in a text file and reload again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preferences sets all filter values back to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will be a different photo when your original will be revealed. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code intake per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is better suitable for high-quality images. this coding is also needed for high-quality images. this coding also requires more record, calculating time and is available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool gives the same dialogue as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour coding can be done by the subwindow for the magnitudes. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can draw up the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of audio files. this tool ensures you to use multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always do the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. you can find further information in the manual.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct loading problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find at colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects brings you four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantonal filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar thermal, also called Sabatier, a effect that was created when one developed a partial pressure of a short flash light. this had the effect that the brighter areas of darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative image of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar control. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible. another increase is a negative picture, that is not to be created on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy effects. the original image is the (1) and the process (2). the applied intensity lies at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filters simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glassy. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one of daylight optimized color film of the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contrasts. but Velvias strongly saturated colours are also some photographers, especially of which the unsuitable landscapes are too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neutronlight on the contrast edges. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the shooting of the neonlichts. in large pictures the filter can remove the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the colour contra-effects of your photos with the tools in the menu below. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you want to make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get a good choice for brightness / saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould gradation and the simple Leuchment / contrast / Gamma is the tool of audio-value correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of sliders. in concrete, the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes a Graphene of Intensity values, a histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graphs, three slider can be turned into the inside and to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control knob and consider how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, on the settings the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this select box can be set, whether the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y axis is frequently used. images of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic subdivision is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three control: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image used to automatically adjust the input of the shade, medium and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Outputs: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each range. there are also two controls that can be used in order to evaluate the output values. for example, the compression values can be used for example. the compression of output values can be used for example, while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values are automatically set in terms of intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and recharged later. in addition, Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour cartridges, the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, medium and sun-rays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to apply the input of the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overload dictator controls all color channels to display overloaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here, it is an indicator, that means you will get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the inputs applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the originals and the target picture is indicated. the preview will be updated dynamically dependent on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel of which module is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this bugs there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. mostly the linear mode of sensual mode is mostly created. in this case, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move to the right, for example, the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding to darker or darker the associated image pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the preview of the original photos is a red marking. if you want to change this marking on the area you want to change the original value, create the original value. create a point on this line and move on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve you can create in the file system and later loaded, the file format is the Gimp cranksformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, central and sunny. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload dictator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. here, it is an indicator, that means you will get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-white photo that was corrected in a luminance channel. shadow and sun beams has been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer der & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels, or modify the colour shaded colours of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colour shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first hint as you can correct the channels by clicking the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be regarded as a comparison of its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are below: knob for red, green and construction allows you to activate these channels. if you activate the respective color components, this is particularly convenient if you are also able to activate the option of monochrome, as the channel mixer is then used to generate great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you come Monochrome, the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from colourless. colorless. if the case is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colourless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purposes. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overload dictator controls all color channels to display overloaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here, it is an indicator, that means you will get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re-adjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white a work step, as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>

<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film cover with a green lens filter. this looks good with all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against heaven. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) Green Filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orfiltered: simulates a black / white film cover with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air pictures. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orfiltered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotak: simulates a black / white film cover with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic effects and can simulate lunar properties for the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">White filter: simulates a black / white film cover with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thereby similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones while it adds a little cold in the shadow of a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a screen, a pop portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry picture text texture apply for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the slopes of the depth and three-dimensional texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text aspect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and changed under (2). the relief relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an viewer to keep the limits of a photo is no easy task. to keep the image of a decorative setting. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, select the desired screen type for your image. the image with a white line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and white pictures), it displays it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a buttonhole and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: there is the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio will have larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important to print the images, especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert a simple-format text in a picture of any popular place. this also goes on several digits when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type text, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its characteristics as you need them. if larger the image, the larger must be the character set. to the end, you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. already, the picture is done.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press "OK" button. after the image has been saved, the text part is part of the image. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool templates can apply template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu template can be used in image processing, to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should be able to add to the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of & digiones, just send an e-mail in english to the & digiplug; mailing list digiplug-Users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to first use, you need to put your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder where you will notice the templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. the selection of a folder will update the template strip of templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the indicated image. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduce this button: this button shrinks the bottom of the mouse. if you want to apply the template onto the whole image, you need to adjust the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to move the template underneath the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use templates on your image. the picture will then be adapted automatic of the front size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipone; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy to produce, especially in dark areas, gravy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpenal mask works on the contrast of the edges to look at a picture sharper. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather psychological. you can use it to remove atmospheric dost and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">The focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is that sharp edges will be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. this is the same phenomenon can be observed when colourings are printed on paper. SLR cameras will normally require more subsequently effective sharpening as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG pictures often a camera has been applied internal sharpness. images in the shell format must always be pushed in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpness filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo by sharpening throwing. this allows you to correct the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural: the sharpness technology increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise of a picture. in general, you can adjust it via the menu entry. under realization, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crispy. the solution to fix the image a bit soft and experimenting with the menu entry and experimenting with the menu entry. the front window on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter insharp masks is a very good tool to remove mugs from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help the image. the front window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should be tried out. if you make the unsharpening mask to strongly, the noise and the impression of grats will create in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filters. high-resolution images allow bigger etches. they should therefore sharpen images at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the missed picture one of the original is added, thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the differential amount. one can define a minimum difference to ensure an edge of the filter. in this way, areas can be used with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and therefore beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp masks filters. the original image is the (1) and the working picture (2). imperfecting was applied using a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digipone; tool refocus is focused on a picture of improvement of the sharpness. it used the copyright protected filming filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create a picture on & quot; refocused approach as just to try the photo. it uses a technique to sharpening images. this is using a technique named FIR Wiener Filing. it is used to start better results than unsharp. you can start it from the menu by using colours reproducible in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular filler works much better than the Gauss's Fsplit. the FIR Vienness is also moving from the source pixies, which is far away from the original pixel size. the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauss is influenced in most cases very strongly from distant pixels. the unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the most important parameter for use this module. it is the most important parameter for use this module. for most images, the default value should place 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very sharp then, but on Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a correlation of the correlation can help reduce artifact. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifact. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value is added even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your unsharpensive filter causes them. in most cases you should use this value to 0, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformation matrix. if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you choose large values for this parameter. in most cases you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purposes. any reproaching parameters that you have set will be stored for later and then can be recharged.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity blocks on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations are not visible immediately, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results than sharpening. this could be caused by this, the unsharp masks a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to be solved insharp masks always artifacts. for the Viennese filter it can never show the effect of the lens filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the infinitely mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening lasty in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator: if the lens has been darkened, it has been darkened to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour content allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want to use blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented speeds.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences of starting points to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass place above the picture. a value of 0,9 should get details so that no sharpening is necessary. please note that the details can always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Angle dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value gloth evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie grains or CCD noise will create a high value of wave similar pattern. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated from a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this is the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Control resistance: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is required, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbullet effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: is how often the algorithm will run through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle of angle [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, there should also be small. be sure to create a small angle a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value as maximum possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step-wide [0,1, 10]: integral stepper in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel gland and never exceeds 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More to quality you get by selecting this option is only low. he doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons stores than and store exactly this. any setting of image errors can be correct with a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a very long and a high CPU load. therefore, you can remove the calculation at any time with the button aborted.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with little artifacts. as you see, there is a unique black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film location during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digipens; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image exchange. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters to remove stains and other artifacts which are used for example dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moirev; effects of single-called images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot depicts a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a gradient space that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the lower window details and the lower window of advanced settings can remain on the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time of filters per pixel and can be pampered by the radius listed above the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller faults adjusted for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening gel. this value sets the pixel pitch to reset the filter to the front. if the value is too high if you need to change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data can't get more and noise or reproaching.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole noise can occur or smokes. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak smoke or JPEG artifacts, without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. this settings will not affect the smoothing process that will be controlled through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to improve a picture. this settings will not affect the smoothing process that will be controlled through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically increases stronger, however, the shadow areas are contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the phosenjitterdamping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance, when it is too high, noise and phasenjitter appear on the edges. it can remove pirate tips and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise level you have set, can be stored in the file system and later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how catching your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the fixed with (2). the noise level was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture to crack for your purpose. luckily, the solution is a bit easier than to sharpen. use the tool to fix the menu with the menu entry and experimenting with the smooth. the front window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools used by photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable articulation of your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's preconception, scratches, compression parties and local errors that makes it possible in digital, original or retrospectively digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the picture contours and receives the content as it also makes human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for paint and texturing. the texturing is performed with another tool, the image error correction, developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / FrannÃ­ and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts minimize: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it even produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these issues.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons stores than and shop make exactly this. any setting of photo restoring can be stored in a text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a very long and a high CPU load. therefore, you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce a photo with equality noise.. The module is applied on a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film-grains on the faces. the original image is below (1) and adjusted under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures can be used on an old color photograph, which was used with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts which have been detected by scanning lighting and photopapier. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digipah; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixel of photos that were covered with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by the copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos a problem, as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the picture dark. the tool is automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to you to discover the dark picture right within the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the proper dark picture to the correct image. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant remembers the last dark image and reloading this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct within the picture. the front window shows the output of the movie with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted up in all imaginable areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the following filters are available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: there is an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a gap of 1 from the pixel block to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-6) or a group of linear curves (1-6). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filming method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block is pulled to a bi-square surface (2-6) or a group of quadratic curves (1-6), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-7) or a group of cubic curves (1-6), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, used. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the adjusted picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; Vignetanimal correction is a tool to correct the vignation, i.e., lower corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially in the medium and large photo format, can often not shed the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetanimal quot; (shaded) they reach the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light into the sensor. telephoto lenses show that this behavior can also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. a lot of Center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens, also with center filter, a opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise unsharpening effects through movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of modern movie cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using a equivalence of a centerfilter, which is used without this filter. the tool Vignetanimal correction apply the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetanimal correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplification at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, or random a luminosity of 2, deciding the density to compensate for a greater degree of Vignetation, reduce him to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchment, contrast and gamma settings: the edit of a picture with the Vignetanimal correction is reduced the luminance of pixels. you need to readjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulator will only increase positive values as you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine rejection of the exposure of the target picture, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digious; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetanimal correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetation in the corners and (2) the correct image. it was also carried out with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second order deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convot form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round-effect, but flawless due to the edges. this correction is not used in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the remote corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion part of the second order. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion is corrected and positive values are broken down distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger in changing the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'corners Parameters, the inverted signal of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and leads to a correcting first degree. negative values increase as positive the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview of distortion correct. the values you use for your image are stored and the next start as default values are used.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or hoid-shaped correction should be done before all concision or size changes. if you want to recut this correction as all first by. if you want to recut a picture and carry out a ton-shaped correction would be the effect of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you the best correction is available to show you this tool a vertical and a horizontal support line. move it into an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in connection, you can correct the tonne / kisses distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a hoop shaped distortion is corrected the resulting image of black corners. you can remove this with the cutting tool in the Menu transformers from the image processing or via the zoom knob.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most photos the ton-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives as e.g. photos from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture below 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always keep a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the ton-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulate infrared film of the Gimpcucumber and org website that can be found under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra-otfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you want to simulate two parameters of film-grains and film sensitivity (ISO). the ISO knob changes the amount of film production and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter channels are mixed for reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the peak power.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter film production is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures, e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X, well known to increase the sensitivity of the films by the manufacturer of large silver-grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-effects effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, graceful view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the KÃ¶rner. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, apply to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-based effect on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and it worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicame; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and breastfeeding are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper elects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better for big pictures. smoothing the smooth or from the other hand, the ariness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the processor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and the # 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter coal drawing uses colour and intages gradient to create a cabbage kizze. therefore, images of their gradients are slowly changing. it is helpful if you imagine what scene would have chosen to sketch you. these are good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the foundations size and the lower adjusted the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving is the image in 3-D when it was stamped on wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraving is a quick tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with images with a simple structure, with which color does not use the most important at content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the picture into a grey, landscape landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allow to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by distortion-effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: the image is divided into cells and can look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the shaft blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by means of unsharpen effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom lens: wiper the image along the constellation lines to go out from a focal point. this simulates the unsharpensive camera and produces a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial effects: wiper the image by rotating the pixel by a focal point. this simulates the lens of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: knowout the picture to create a non-focused camera content. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sharpen: knowout the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the unsharpening of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Turnout unsharpening: wiper the picture soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">SchÃ¼tte sharpen: wiper the image by random shift the pixels and simulates the unsharpening of a arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpenises: finds the Farms in the picture and wipes these without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. therefore, this calculation can therefore cancel any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make shelf drops on your picture. this makes it natural your images a great look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">The drop size makes it possible to change the size of the drops. since the drop-size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the amount and density of drops. fish change the optical effect on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep up with the & digiplug; image processing a field free of shelves. use the range of tools to select the area, e.g. a face that shall be free to remain free. if you start the filter shelf, the area will remain free of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the proper orientation. you can find the tools in the menu transformers or transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo aufasen is definitely one of the most developed tools to get a photo, with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is how you can zoom in a picture? how can you find the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm which is used here is a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used to change a linear interaction method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a sort of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digious; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the riders new size and count down below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio should be retained at the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Control resistance: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is required, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' tower effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons stores than and loading will be used exactly. every application for photo, can be saved as text file and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the larger image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cut of a photo is not only an frequently performed surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. the mouse allows you to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and move the rectangle, you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview as your photo look like your photo after cutting. you can create the size of the cutting area by moving to the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting button, use the knob button of the image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or file Save to the File menu to save the new cut-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the frame area, you can change the size of the rectangle by changing the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the width format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After side effects uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, irrespective of whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons for selecting the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the widest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio, its settings depend on the image sequence (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data can be reflected in the image image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">You can help grab the settings of the interaction for help to put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious parts are based on the principle of similarity. like the third row, harmonic triangles have a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that can be found in different natural growth patterns, such as spiral in a Nautilus shell or the bubbling of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we are as nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already in the old Egyptians and Greeks, who used their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is guided from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where every number is equal to 1: 618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually follows as visual harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle makes fluid aid lines available when you assemble a picture. these help are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral becomes good results for your photos to get closer. compared to third-party gel, the golden spiral line produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangle. there should be something that the eye is in the center of composition. this can be a line of its or different objects. this can be just as being without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also discussed by the golden spiral. their vertex points are the middle points of the sides of the golden-corner. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles have no equilateral triangles. diagonal to place a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break your frame you will create a effect from professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the knob color you can set the colour of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. on this type you can adjust the color of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture, where things are rotated vertically or horizontally. you can repair this with the & digious; image processing and tool free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target range.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide is specified in degrees. with the button preferences, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is provided a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture, you can find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is the function transformers cut from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing should be smoothed the picture a bit after the turn. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivan transformations are carried out around a reference point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then be recharged automatically. on the right side of dialogue, you will find some information which can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">At the top left: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the right above: shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle links below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right edge of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective, the image will be dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations generates an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After completing the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes on the corners. a possibility to bersome it is the image with transformers cut from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool bar is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the Horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press the default settings, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of Effective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown on the right of the front section.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help your help become a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point like e.g. the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool bar to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the shot, the picture becomes a bit smoked. this effect is usually negligible, but two notes are twice as much as the amount and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the picture, the picture has a nice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is the image with transformers.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digipens; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. therefore, the available formats are related to your system and in some cases, from the type how these libraries compile have been compile. in most distributions you will be able to process a large number of images formats with & digial.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to these dependency on other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digip; displays only files in formats to know. this is done by file expansion and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can change this list of file extensions the & digial; accepts. in section configuration you will find further information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select that file format. a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia, and supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures based on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save losses free if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the shell format, you can read more about Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter from & digiplug. in section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="725">& graphic viewers; is a KDE programme for viewing and graphite; programmes are free layout programs. graphs are available in science, particularly in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs and X11; - or & tclutk; programs with only few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & graphic viewer; project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& graphic viewers; is a KDE programme for viewing & graph; -dot; Graphene. displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Conqueror; (so that a change of Graphene in & Kate; the Graphene is newly calculated and in & graphic viewers; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the Graphene in & Kate; to open or open the graphs in & graph; in one & Kate; -Component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load of large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a hack to read more than this node)</seg>
<seg id="731">Another required software: & graphic viewer; is a & kde; program, which the & graph; tool & dot; for representation of graphs are required. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the open graphs, each in its own lower window. initially, if you start & graphic viewers, the main window will only open the Symbol file and opened the (empty) list. click on the first icon to display the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files selected, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse bike (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressing & Alt; -button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file has just changed in & graphic viewer, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or if you want to ignore the alteration. & graphic viewers, can also realize your decision whether later also. should you want to change your choice later, you can use the menu item settings: setting up... see, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a Graphendatei out of a running & graphic viewer; open-instance, & eg; in the file browser or at command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & graphic viewer; instance, or to be able to display the loaded graph in a lower window of the already ongoing instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but then change them with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also define how the graph should be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several sites, you can choose whether the parts of the graphite, which are on a side, will be fixed on this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graphite.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for invalid graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the dive model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equally significant with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm created for invalid graphs a jump model - layout. it uses the Fruit-Reingold Healing, and includes a multi-grate timer for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; Algorithm assigns the node al in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit the metadata of a picture. the geographical data are stored in the EXIF sample of the image and the localization can be displayed in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization is provided by images geographically in the spherical coordinate system, which is used by GPS and Galileo, is used to localise. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlated your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as a XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical Localization Correlator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialogue appears then. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to download a trace file with GPX file. this file also contains data the same time taken at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, there is an automatic correlation between the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT-time and therefore the camera must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera capacity. lies the deviation among them are collected. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will be correlated to all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality a locating in a wide time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then correlated the button correlated to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set up with this dialogue. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same site. as the dialog, the coordinates of a call to the next you need to use only the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge. choose the relevant region and increase. add this always through, until you have an adequate accuracy. the card must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to add a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module allows you to export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums used as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be encoded as UTF-8 to enable an best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to the settings. you need to select these albums only. the albums will not select hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area, the Albenvorschau and the text of the text will appear in the head of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely self-explaining. the option for each image has a page. when you click on a picture a new page will be opened in the image. otherwise, the picture will be shown directly with your default image, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery shall be stored with all your associated images. choose a folder on the write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">In case you have chosen the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the default color depth. the file size also influences the file size. all other settings are explaining itself.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab Previews allows you some of the settings from the album tab for the front images, that are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press off to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module produces the pages the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programming interface to determine whether defects occurred during the creation. web browser will automatically start to show the preview of the gallery. press the Close button to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and on them basic operations such as screenings, zooming, or shifts. the viewer can be used with short sleeves and poets. it was developed for a quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After launching, a picture is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to alter images without blocking your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images from the JPEG format, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is rising since no compressing of the color information takes place. this can also be found at PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-click is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-Klient is currently not a documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Teams under kde-Imaging @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-Imaging @ kde.org des KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata model, you can copy data from a picture to another copy. then select the import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the sequence option with which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is in writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, add the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background colour for the slide. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you must select the images that are packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can start the module about Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then included in image files in the portfolio. there you can also sorting the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds. the speed of the picture is set down below. a low value creates a very sudden, high contrast, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set next. in doubt, you should send them black. the name and the path of the generated file you can set under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension of the extension.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it is integrated into the movie. once you can cook your wishes to the movie. depending on your computer's speed, you can now drink a coffee or drink a coffee when you come back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that code or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right settings below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on one sheet paper along with a sheet of paper. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Image Processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM respectively.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcrab by Dave Coffin. a original score from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results like the software from your camera brands. sometimes you will get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw picture converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now redefine the values in order to optimize the convergence process. the first option decides, whether the camera settings are to be used as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further refine the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and store the convergence result. the file name remains equal and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file size.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image Format, TIFF, reserves all the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW Compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you often have to edit your pictures or later, you should not use the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata will contain in the RAW file, stored in JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack mode allows you to convert different pictures at one time. use this mode therefore if you are sure, for example through testing an individual image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress report shows how far the conversion is gone.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of one album. you can prefix the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the time.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image and enlarge. in addition, four types of the image will be provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. this option remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of photo paper. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it's also possible to change the size of the selected images in advance. more images can draw on the list of these images and remove them there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you start the module, the images captured by you are displayed with the selected pictures. you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview of the right shows will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the images and add the list to the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The selected pictures are removed from the list of selected pictures from the list below.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open the new message from your e-mail clients with the button OK. you only need to add the addresses and subject to the subject. these pictures are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of the sent e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used once again until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must install the GmailAgent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images into a text file, and the mail was enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a quick internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG pictures on file format and are original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the latest images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed with you. however, your e-mail program is started automatically at the end. with the button Close you can shit this window? EN.</seg>
<seg id="885">After the start of the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have shown your Diashau. you can choose between you selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option is using very elegant image outputs using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the Diashau is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filenames option indicates that the file name of the images will appear in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop makes it possible to display the presentation in a endlosse loop. you can manually break it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random sequence. so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time difference between the images can be set between each images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should get out this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly chooses any other effect between pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diashau you can access a tool bar at the upper left screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can start the presentation and start again, stop the previous and next image jump and stop the dip.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower edge of the screen, you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not have any documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI Teams under kde-Imaging @ kde.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the lower menu, as background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & a photo album; see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the picture, then in each group, so in people, places and in the group topics are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories, for which you have entered more than you have provided your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the actual presentation pictures. in the following is described each for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press with the mouse on the entry, changing the browser view. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you are able to select another person only the images are displayed on which both people are visible. by this selection method, you can limit the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images on a few single pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view images with presentations to view the images of your activity area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can store up & photo album; however, for every person there is an own preconception, this also applies to places, jector and other categories that you have defined themselves. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button on the right outside on the tool bar. in the published context menu, you can select that you can view the view for each category. this has the advantage that you can display a sample with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keyword (if you have no appropriate pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must select a picture displayed for each individual person. in order to view this, you will have to select a picture editor, as shown in the picture. here you can select the picture for the appropriate person. in the safest window, you can select the magnification factor according to your wishes and that part of the image will be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you sign up in the main window, give you a dialogue, which is very similar to the dialog for the ceremonial of the image properties. this dialog allows you to see on the picture even once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the box type or description, the labelling or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, such as 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images as well as you can see in the picture. here it will see pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photo album; if you don't like to read handbooks but rather like to try functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photo album; and look at the fast-up, screen photos and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photo album; and select in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select in the menu help the menu entry in a photoalbum; -Demo. then some example will be uploaded and you can try the functions of & photo album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & photo album; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the lower edge of the main seat of & photo album; see the timer. a picture of this corpest you see here:. as the name suggests, this Leists show you data about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timer can display you several different time units. each body shows a different unit. you can change between units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timer can be interactive to the following ways: you can select the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you see a date, you will always see the first picture of this date displayed in preview) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images at the moment when you will navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and mouse over the lineal of time line, so the time values, pull you in the preview view only pictures of this period. you can pick up the selection by clicking on a bar at the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photo album; you can create two options available to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is in & a photo album; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user book it will be described in & photo album; built-in version, which you can create about the menu HTML... instantly.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following is exactly described above.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and description, which should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML example pages you can see an example for this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose from whether a & a photo album; -export file should be created on the reviews page. ferry information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed. this allows you to be shown that all pictures of a party are obvious. note that all pictures are exported; currently all pictures exports. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain amount of sight.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most importation options are clearly, why this is not made special.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can set different resolutions for images. this allows you to view your web page and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no pictures more than the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">You can change the resolution of your site at any time. it can therefore change your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time, as well. if it wants to get a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for any subsequent proposition a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically adds to the next time. this folder allows you to select either a file or a KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check that this really all visible for viewer. if you select a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL, which you can define here, should be that folder. otherwise, the web browser should start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML-files created not yet in the final target file you will need to manually copy them manually. this means the import function, see, right now you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files but the basic folder where all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just configuration options are related to all three on basic folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder created whose name can be specified in the output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are interested in a family party, a meeting or somewhere else, with other users of & a photoalbum; you might want to add a HTML page to viewing the images. if you're already looking for a lot of time for viewing the images, persons on the pictures, entrance location, etc., you need to be able to do with & a photo album. this work cannot even be done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. image properties will be included with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they distinguish themselves in the file or whether the images are stored in the file or if you have any pictures taken into the file, you can keep all pictures together and this file can be stopped independently. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is searching for a double way. first searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if you are not found the images of the URL, which you have given to create HTML files, this is only possible if you have created your .kim file via HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export images are described, which you can export about the menu Export...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .kim files. there are the following three options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you enter the manual close to the .kim file, you will have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the automatic copy to the .kim file, copy & photo album automatically; the images automatically set for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it usually doesn't want to compress the files. if you like this, simply select the export file compression.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you can send the pictures maybe not in full size, as the .kim file would be very big because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can say the size limit, for example, that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from a web browser or from the menu file imports... select & photo album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the importation consists of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folders import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are to use the category persons to be imported to the imported file (if you are a dans) while this category is asked for your database people. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported in the third dialogue window, which are to be imported into account in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can use the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example for this you can see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and look at: when you see images, one would often jump in from different picture groups jump & mdash; if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture of your friend, you might want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) of the information about your images, via (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptability to pass through.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today it takes care of your videos. thanks to many places in this manual it will be spoken about images, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; records all its information in the file index.xml in the top-file of their images. this is a simple XML file that allows you to back up a diskette or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; note the folder where your images are stored and used this at future Starts automatically. if you want to start another database with pictures, you can start & photo album; with the option -c. as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry settings of photoalbum; insert... come to a window, which allows you to change the settings of & photo album. in the following section of the book booking you will discuss the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can call the setup possibilities of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available that you can retrieve a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you as you can define for each image, for example, people, locations and tags. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for each available group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialogue options you can set complete membership groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained in a group rather than in a group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup possibilities you can choose to specify the member groups. you can select the category selection list. in the left hand side, you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin Interface. you will find the homepage of Kipi on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can not be described in this manual because they are not part of & a photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call over the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are common with each other, it can be tested with the demo database, before you use these on your own images. demo-database allows you to either call the command line with the command &gt; photo album -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & a photoalbum; do not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that are also using KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums: this type of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order for albums, so you can use the functions with & a photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">To simulate & photo album, the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture review currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & photo album, the modules also has a list of albums. here goes & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then every record this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or there will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums, so you can do so for example the category people, so do if you had selected persons to view and continue the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the modules, which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you can start & photo album with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the top one menu and a toolbar. under the tool bar, you can't have any information about your images. in this section we will be back on this window, and now click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photo album; is the possibility to see each image with notes, where the picture was taken on the picture, where the picture was taken either separately or for a larger number of images may set up certain notes at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box, setting people, locations and passwords. these are a very important part of & photo album; when you will always use information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shift of images within the list: if you are shown for example a family party and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are shown, you can find that the names are shifted upward, which can be found faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a alphabetical list of alphabetically, click on the icon for sorting to date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen notes for each image, you might have to process all selected pictures and provided these pictures with notes. click here to check the back and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and add multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the access dialogs it is possible to add a entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also add a entry to a category and place there to make this entry on a subcategory of this entry. attention, this is ahead that you just sort your categories alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the dialogical dialogs by forming the top-edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a window of its own window by drag him out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, you are pleased with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the option to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame too complete. if you want to get displayed this window later, use the button options... and click here a / out window. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select images in your browser, you will receive an overview of the currently selected images, or all pictures if you don't have any filter here. for example, you can see the size of the front images, configure by simple to drag the mouse with the medium mouse button. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you place a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this image will appear on the picture. if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures from the images. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to erase and press either the removal key or select either the removal button or select the menu Edit. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use photos stored on the hard disk. of course, you need to record images anywhere, thus & photo album. in the picture you can see the view of & photo album. if not all necessary pictures from the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the images are available, so that & a photo album can indicate that you can view the preview of these images. however, you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this feature you need to copy files from folders and copy it again. if you don't want to avoid troubles, like the passage to your images, please buy a bigger hard disk to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you can find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, you can view the images that you can see for other unaccessible and click on the current view. alternatively, you can also select all images that can see your little sister, contests and the menu entry everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set that pictures in the case of the fish are to be hidden. if you want to lock the laptop now to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, making all images that you have been locked. if you want to display the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to establish a password, which must be entered for unlocking the images. to set up this password, choose your password in the privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this picture protection cannot be sure. for one you can read off all pictures on the hard drive and to the other one can read the password as a turnkey text or delete the password as an unturnable text. this type of password protection is only to be familiar to those who are with & a photo album; not very familiar with view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you spend all your images with & photo album; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to view them sometime. for this reason you can look at some point. for this reason & photo album. this is a picture _ and video viewer. you can look at the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer. it is of course the image, but an additional information you can enter about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily move it with the mouse, and you can also configure which information displayed and whether all of these options are available on the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see, matching entries to this page. if you click Anne Helene, the browser displays all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several pictures in the viewer, you can jump between them and back by using the keys picture high and image below. you can jump on the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as a dip. & photo album. as frequently it can print a new image after a few seconds. as frequently it can be controlled by the Ctrl key and Plus or Minus by pressing the button Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & photo album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer, you can easily pull out into the picture. with the mouse button, you can easily pull out a rectangle. with the Minus button, you can zoom back into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoic.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the default setting up the zooms, so each pixel is equal to a pixel of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work on videos that are in and out-zooming with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the shooting functions of the context menu, you can turn the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make any comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you see images, you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put it on the picture. at the moment you can watch the image and view configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. but you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and consider further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images on paper to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you see one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with characteristics while you see. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters. in see a picture of which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, you can see them in the browser. so you can see all the pictures you want, print or whatever you have chosen. this is described in. afterwards you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the front view, then you can add features to the pictures, then you can simply add features to the images by pressing the letters for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you are allowed to paint & photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The brick is not stored with the image, but in the database. you can do this way back later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see a picture on the painted way. in order to switch off the painting mode of & photo album; turn on the picture from the context menu. simply remove the cross in the tool bar at the top at the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; do not have to rule the application of the program & Povray; not completely prevail, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have read and understood them.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then the properties will be displayed in the object properties and the object included in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. however, not the object of an selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will allow you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can select selected objects from the scene either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you've changed properties, click user to check these changes. if you enter invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can click the input errors and rediscard the changes with break.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; enter your documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you are editing a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview of your own view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview of The Scenic View and a small example of the scene will be selected with the chosen texture. if you want to rendering a subordinate element, even if you want to rendering a subordinate element (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross it locally.</seg>

<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotating as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through drag with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a feasibility stage. you can specify this value relatively to the visibility level or as absolute value. objects will be displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility stage less or equal to the scene selected in the toolbar level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need another order, you can save them as well. you can also store multiple shutters and switch between different assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To set a window over or under one view, drag the memory to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the memory to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to arrange multiple views on each other, drag the facade in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card pack reite above into the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order are floating views: views, which are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchor, drag the ripener on the desktop or click on the small to the left-pointing arrow on the top left.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the facade bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the menu, you can find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can rop them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view you can save with window window order... save. it will display a dialog in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon rendering the symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s INI files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can submit many Render modes, from a fast preview of up to full images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon of the object in the toolbar or select in the menu View Render modes... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name any name, but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the wrong image. if you want to rename only a small area of the image, select the bottom section and enter the image section to rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality, you can select the features that uses & Povray; for rendering, this is based on a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the cleaning features can be found in the user manual, & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture with just a beam per pixel, different errors can be created. these pictures often have a MoirÃ¨ pattern or chair effects in curves and lines, besides, sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general, pictures are better from this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, then connects and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adapting because each pixel is again split again and adaptive because each pixel depends on calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values indicate the specified threshold, then two pixels will be calculated using a specific number of pixels with super-sampling, a grid of 4x4 is calculated using a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values the predefined threshold is divided, the pixels is split into 4 sub-pixel, which will continue to be pursued individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recusion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changed & Povray; the Rays to avoid frequent pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this carton card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file impulse... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently it supports & kpovmodeler; yet not the complete command-up of & Povray; when when importing error messages or warning messages, a dialog box shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't want to support source code in & popovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can remove objects from the object tree in the editor to import the source code for & Povray; this adds text file in the editor. to import objects in the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag him into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert into & popovmodeler; and in your editor you can also insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is divided. usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in your own view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the quoted object. set the path to your document tion and the version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (for example alfelddles) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for control points. the second color is used for displaying selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type characters.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and shooting.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as ball, you can set the details stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high detail accuracy for advanced projections, all wire-model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections of the perspective and vertical projections. this feature makes a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects are rounded. the wall is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, a bottom right below the objects are rounded. the floor is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate Cantonal terms, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for rendering scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. precise information about the parameters can be found in the section of Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in section window arrangements is explained how you can create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window system: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window order in the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of pre-hand shutters shows all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement can easily create and remove a selected arrangement with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all the views for the chosen window order. new views can easily create and select selected views with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new columns you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with impee you get the window under the existing window, using map card together with the previous view and slipping the view, not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow without any more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should easily create the ultimate but easy scene: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should have carefully notice the following warning before you complain that you can only get a result of a black screen. if you use a 3D program to first use, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't adjust camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have anything faultless installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their use.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and select the menu entry editing. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view. this is the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of view object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera will find. in user documentation to & Povray; you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for instructions, but note that you can change the camera in view of the camera, with which you can change the target point of camera. just click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or button, change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene. you could insert a quader (inserting body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a controversial method of the solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or button. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view is now also the level, although at the moment only as a limited level. if you renounce the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object tree exactly, you will find out that you can click the options for each new object. in this case, you will find only the standard options for each new object: scaling, turning and shift. choose one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the soil to practice a unit under the horizontal line, just so you can get to know some of these parameters. choose differences and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, choose the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue, where you can choose to select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the object tree (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a sheet black material because you can still need to enter the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. also, you'll have the colors for the pigment. now there are many possibilities for this, but take the easiest ways now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you see in preview no color on Quader and ball, click the button to check the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you get your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the colour. here you are necessary to enter two new attributes. in the colour list you need to enter two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can also do this entry twice, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree every time and change the colors in view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should also easily execute, since you should have understood the fundamental work mode of & kpovmodeler; the bullet can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (don't forget to press the input button or button to press the button), so you would like the ball over the ground, as you have moved the ground down a unit below.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a strange result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a mole black material. put a suitable material in the following steps.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now show a material now. as in the bottom, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the right object and change the name for example in spherical pigment. click on the ball pigment, then choose single-hand and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you may reach more interesting effects if you take time to set some final features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on users or press the button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it which allows you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, hopefully you have already learned much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you're looking for a scene raytracing, the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will result in the scene and how atmospheric effects, such as nebula. thus, the scene will be machined to pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously every scene must be saved, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the Standard file dialog, you can select a file that you've created before using & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Presents the scene in the last stored version. all changes have been rejected since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry, if you do not have any changes stored in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last modified command. you can only select this menu entry, if you are used to do editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or add an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the keyboards and change the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialogue to change the keyboard abbreviation. you can change or add new settings for & kpovmodeler; add commands or newer.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog for the device of toolbars. you can add and remove the toolsymbols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-Map is a way to fake rough surfaces without any bending on the surface without changing without the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models will then be machined to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& ball show; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, where you can select images on display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a single window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with Click the & LMBn, or the Return button.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly seen in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts. a sample set for the DCOP-function break could be & zb; like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-lines options of Qt and & kde; Amarok has some own command lines options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback when the script can't be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script, whether all the modules are present and use the dialog, so the user suggests why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin 'Korundum' ResidentiError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is Required for this script.'. dialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the file scripts / template you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or use it simply to expand the required features. they will quickly find that writing scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP you can exchange your scripts data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which every KDE installation should be enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts languages allow external programs and commands. this will usually be called exec (). this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easy. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sent notifications to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, scripts are written continuously on the default of scripts. for this reason, scripts should react on their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. if a script is started, Amarok sets the workfolder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signals that a new piece is used. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions further information about the new piece (for example the metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume signalized a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Custommenuclicked: submenu entry, Contains the path to the selected files of playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be added. in order to add a menu entry, the DCOP-function dcop amarok script addresis used to remove dcop amarok script MoveCustomMenuItem (submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; end, or if the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed by a web server. these packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.bz2), which can also be compressed as bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept the script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main subscription must be executable (+ x), the remaining to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and the link to the Viking scripts page of & amarok; add up for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you must have Kdelibs installed so (including the programs contained, because & amarok; requires some of them to find such modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD is precursed that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these represent an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably, one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library for days. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and hang also the capsulated file that has caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>

<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line dcop. to make sure that & DCOP; functions can be used, you must make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have common & code; program common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and more functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createDataCD Project () DCOPref createVideoProject () DCOPref createmovixDVDProject () DCOPref createmovixDVDProject () of the COPRef ChatemovixDVDProject () of the tomydvd () of the tomydvd () of the burncdimage () of the burncdimage (cat URL) of burndvd (KURL URL)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a DCOP reference to the newly created Project: DCOPref (k3b, K3bProject-0) alternate a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b provides the top of K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Other createFolder (QString name, QString containing) An addess (URL:: list URLs, QString cube), replaceable items (Qstring path) for rename items (Qstring path, Qstring newname) with setop (Qstring path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3binterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createfoldable / foo dcop $PROJECT scateFolder test / foo dcop $PROJECT scateable / dfile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; it is an audio CD; it can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio- is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and from many Kodiers, which are encoded with WAV files (compressed-free compression) and FLAC (without loss-free compression). more codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Become in a second step this WAV files (usually a pro title) compresses into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the read & CD is used by & kaudio-; cdparanoia is used. almost any distribution has put together a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed yet, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already been installed, but it is highly likely not necessary to compile yourself. but if the code is not used for example FLAC, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format is to be used? chapter Which codiers provides a small introduction on codiers, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying audio CDs: as already said, uses & kaudio-; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection. in any case, it is not possible to avoid an protected audio CD; do not avoid the mechanisms of copier protection. simply avoid the purchase of copier audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once, (the setup dialog can be found as often called up to a suitable configuration), the daily use of an & CD will be found on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, where you can often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codiers are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from FreeDB file from Internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the commands of the main road. on the page step for step example, there are further information, such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the registers for the program configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">It starts the CDDB on request of CD data according to the establishment of the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the register card settings in the set-up configuration - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that selecting with another encoder can be read as the default. it is recommended that before the encoder can be configured in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already selected file will be chosen to encode instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog for the type of notifications (such as protocols, Piepsen) for programming events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main sequence dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different card maps (such as encoder, for setting up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codiers and compression ratios, and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a loss-free audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats used by data compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG have the most common. OGG likes to have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above that bit rate the differences are less important because both codiers are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will be supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG-playdevices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If music is to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - these tools do only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset media '= This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression rate of about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo devices. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely have the absolutely highest quality, you choose the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that manually entered or automatically taken by the FreeDB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed / kaudioCreator; and the code program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or help to the code explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) when MP3s must be coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator must be added; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiodes; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the FreeDB is: a free database, where you can download the audio CDs that can download the information, so that all other these information can be downloaded to the calculator. it is to note that here only from text is said: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc; not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm. of the Ueberais) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist can still be added to the music company. all information can be found at a bowel by a & CD; shop, physically or virtual, can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; it is active to select a check box (sending a address). in this type of configuration, it seems to use the e-mail address when retrieving data from the server (this can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudioCreator; for use by FreeDB, the geographically is needed to use the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates on the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which output program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that it is used with cdparanoia; who wants to be more precise, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see. note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed, if this is not yet to happen.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the selected WAV files, the code can be chosen to select the desired file format. during the first opening, there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the Registerers tab. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution, before the codiers can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined codiers. more information about codiers are in the chapter of Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codile, more information on its switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device recording of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal command line. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; check out the shell & CD. do not check out the CD & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can indicate how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but somehow are still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-to-step example, and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, everything setup and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be installed in cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. if it is not fully compatible for your Linux distribution. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files as you can do, of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists, and that you write permission to copy them (eg; try to copy the queror into something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section is the basic set of & kaudio-, something probably what is done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes this approach to read & CD;, which needs to be repeated for each download & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the use of using the compression (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). because we are lazy, we share the program to download the FreeDB to download the data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change this settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read & CD, but once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device record is handed over to the read range that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, so a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to create existing entries of the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The boxes of the General Settings. here you can't do much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be shown / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you ask for complete information, so that you will be informed if you are missing information on the information of keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD automatically download via the Internet from a FreeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading the & CD; with the internet, so that he can access the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry was found immediately when you are unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or day entries, they can easily change files and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">In addition to this example, if you want to manually enter all manually, select the selection fields and FreeDB if you want to download the database before. however, this is worth 620 MB in the offline mode, the two select fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following carton card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are settings for the data on request, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDB-Server on the Internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about FreeDB. put everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the Conedb.org page and look at a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. this setting will however work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls protocol 8880's standardly boxed, is maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD to the FreeDB server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, is there a reason why more than one at the same time at only an existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author doesn't know it simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folders for temporary files: if you're sorry, the path / folders will be specified in which the WAV files are stored. if the box is not connected, the files will not be crossed in the private file. don't forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All such as it is on the screen photo. the command is a bit long, under circumstances must be blown up to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo system. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the production of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 "Tags can also be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input (including the complete path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: using a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, more than a WAV file can be coded simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading the CD-CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, as we are convenient, and the CD; data from FreeDB has to be arranged. the process is described in this section, must be repeated for each download & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are a & CD, which is not included in FreeDB, see screen photos a bit different than those for one & CD; with successfully run from FreeDB. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data can be used manually, instead of sending them out of the internet. comments will refer to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this sample is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD now must be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as shown in screen photo. this only when the CD-CD can be identified as audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, search in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous paragraph concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully from the FreeDB, all titles of the songs are already completed and additionally the name of the artist and the album are indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window in the database, and you can select the database entry, which fits your opinion on your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the check box for automatic query by FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the Settings), you can manually remove this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but you will need to collect the data from the internet, you will need to connect to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - typing the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update Title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of inique per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments on all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from FreeDB, the CD editor is not empty, but it's always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (such as if all words with uppercase begin or not...), but also to verify if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you are using ID3v2 tags, you have a maximum of this option. this option is set up on the counter display settings; take a look into the section 'Basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the help of the code to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select a entry, the obviously with the style of the unloaded CD; this example is not important because we don't review the & CD; for more information, please go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available at Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors appears again and you see that the fields for the album is already filled with the specified data, which we've recorded for the first piece. enter the items for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece for any event and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded data from FreeDB. it is sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of tool bar. note that the artist and album are displayed on the part list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before every line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. make sure that all pieces are selected, or enter the button All pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection read the reading process, this window appears to confirm the confirmation. click OK and then we will see a view of the window with the essays and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you see if you are trying to work with a code which you still have not installed. pieces have not been successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered in the example. have you checked if you have a write access to the folder for the temporary files and the targets?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus you can read and encode in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it's now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not find the configuration settings to inhibit this behavior. the number of parallel processes to read and encode. with performance weak machines the result is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 doesn't seem to be able to read and encode (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded in the waiting period of the code. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio-, you need & kde; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and get the button to play in the tool bar, select the entry menu from the menu piece or get the space key.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the & kmid; window. (with several pieces, they are added to a collection and then follow succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece plays, you can jump in any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the control.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast, or too slow, you can click on the arrows to turn left and right the speed display. to get the original speed again, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space key has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the empty button, or select the menu entry into the menu, interrupts the playback. enter the space during no play, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and again others both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically disable, allowing you to manually change the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event type, choose the menu settings and recieves from the menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you can summarize. these are played in row after. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find this in the menu collection under the Point Organise.... click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can adjust the each capped to the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. read that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in collecting manager. there you can add a song. there will be again the file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on setting Automatically the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If Automatically enabled to activate the collection, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using file opening or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu, the order is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the next song next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump on a song back, select the button predictive piece, the entry predictive pieces from the menu or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button deleting.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it doesn't matter if it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizers, which are not General-MIDI capable. in this case, MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts to the change of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet and therefore lets you sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM -devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all necessary reels for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may seem as often as desired. precondition for this is that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email, so I can provide support for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the DC sign is ignored. it is assumed that GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all the tones that need this instrument on the tone with the number M (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a rifical surplus. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP -Section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (defensive surplus), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant, with each sound a different percussioning instrument (drum, tank, Maracas & etc;) is, and not the one that means the clay-height of the same drums (such as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how notes are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As the PATCHMAP -section is the sequence of lines very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use various names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used especially to form tones on the perimeter channel. check out as an example the supplied keyword.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to replace the first and the second channel, simply make it simply in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will continue to use the name name for this channel. if you are ignored the ForcePatch option, all events will ignore that patch can be changed on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussions patch on the perpetual channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender ratio can be multiplied in which ratio of pitch-Bender events will be converted to the value n, this will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to be in the map file no decimal number).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM says that a keyboard with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards up to play two tones up to an octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of piviets (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivives you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. if you have changed a instrument, the button does not have any more green but red, to show that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. select the settings in the menu Settings under the Point channel: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD shows the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc. so you can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3-file requires a similar sound quality. in addition to a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binding distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have happened, because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's main page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & cross-queror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, disable the settings Automatically Storing the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow button to the left from Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD double click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desk a & conqueror; -window with my MIDI file and & kmid; if I want to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, only into the & konqueror; window switch and the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull out.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file, without adding them directly to a collection, turn your setting Automatically to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open from files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid.. you only want to play the first file. so, adjust the setting Automatically to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all many thanks! if I listen to these songs or the postcard, animated me further on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; in the moment I'm written in the third year, so I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I'm trying to give me a bit time. as hobbies, I'm able to program MIDI files, making music and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an expansion of & kmid; do, or even if you just want to make me happy, write to me an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, if you want to send a MIDI file, you should get in touch with me because I might have the file maybe already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I & kmid; I wrote & kmid; fully written in my free time and it's not getting tired of money. I would therefore pray that I will only get my programming messages because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is the window with playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed if information is repeated within it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to connect the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category definitive playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchiehood. if you like an entry, his group and all his subgroups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the post-listed entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and continuous playlist can also be changed through direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that by using a editor, but also through the application itself. it is simply click on a name of a category click on the menu, and next processing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu has to be selected with playlist, and select either the edit mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the processing mode left or another group is chosen without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and end can be deactivated by the editing of ~ / .kde / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 'option to' 1 '. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / or / kmplayer / or .xml and ~ / .kde / or / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at Starts does not need to be short, it will automatically end by opening a different source. however, this would be annoying with the end animation but the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of an start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; IMG major = "insolete; & lt; / bodygt; / bodysuit; & lt; in the directory tests / kmplayer; are included in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configuration of MPlayers in configuration dialog by & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the intermediate memory size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / config / kmplayerrc as the setup of the backend by mimosype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the pcodec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & kmplayer; you can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To restore the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave flash will be specified in the setup dialog file of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror & & kmplayer; is able to search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if no error occur, the backup output is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a predefined backend for a particular Mime type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phono should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV maps, either using MPlayers or Xvideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV, the scanner can be configured to use the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog is available in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be possible ports to be found, e.g., it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name is probably included a DVB-in.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer only Xvideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also available only on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux extension for the X server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>

<seg id="1930">In order to install a Plugin or a KPart I begin with the menu plug-ins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all plugins to manage and add new plug. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. add plug-ins without a memory location & quantum. this path to searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often in a project several people work in a type of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantum. by team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email records are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, like both team managers and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look for themselves out of the list of Team Members which he is. this is happening by doing the Team Member out of the list and the button Setze as presses. the currently selected member (their identification) appears to be bold as you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and attitude of your own identity are important in terms of messages and notes. see further information on remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of their team, there is another advantage through the collection of members of the team: it can be created an event for information on the team leader when something is happening. see more information on more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that will be executed if something is happening in the project. one example would be the draw of the open and closing of the project, as much someone has worked, or the sending of a message when a file is secured, or a script that will be added to the CVS as soon as it will be added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal commentaries through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Notes to enter is simple. it can be selected either from the editor-text menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary area followed by a feature text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to an uncertainty member of the team. in this case, the name of the team member @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where the nickname of the Team Subproject Manager, Subproject Manager, according to the enrichment and sub-project management, should be led by the enriched or subproject name, as shown in the examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be called by settings Quanta... to be called. This dialog covers some pages that are treated in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantitization; referring to tags, including car, can be changed. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / small dimensions of tags: large / small dimensions of automatically added tags. normal / small size means that tags will be inserted as described in day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / small size of attributes: big / small dimensions of automatically added attributes. normal / small size means that the attributes are inserted so as they are described in day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if possible, for tags, for which the final day is optional, this is immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and end-day automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding single day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding coding during the entry.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetic types for detecting various types of files. using the default standard, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or in other manner as open-open files (where the coding of the file can be negotiated), but this setting will be sent out by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting will be sent out by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup head: & quantum algorithms, created regularly backup head, so that in a power loss or crash when the next start of the program can be restored, this is not the same as saving the file. it is not the same as saving the file. it is also used for even stored documents according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or a private view (or the documentation in a Karteirev), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1962">The warning messages can be used to control the ability of warning through anhades of non more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as the synchronization of the VPL- and the source code in shared mode. in terms of different modes, see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here, the parser and the structural tree, which depicts the image of the Parser knots in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the scope of mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on structural structure with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structure-tree settings the visibility of the tree at the editing and how deep should be opened automatically with a change in the structure of the structure. empty knots are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such a element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for the application of abbreviations (a kind of templates) that can be unfolded at the processing of a more extensive text. this means, it can be valid for several & DTEP; s, it can be valid for several & DEP, in which the iftests acronym something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are used by the third side which can be reused by each KPart-enabled application, most well-known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-ins, the following may be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to Plugin, if it is not at a booth like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be delivered to the Plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the related file (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component of the "Only-Lese" mode: check if the plug-in is refusing. only Lese-KParts usually refuse to load when this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the Plugin: is this activates, then testet & quantum; if the given information is correct, then the plug-in is not available if the Plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitivity; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redesigned. (3) Debugger was discontinued, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger Plugin was implemented, which allows different implementations of plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">At present, only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantum.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching Debugger plugins in the project settings. with the button options next to the Debugger-Plugin selection box, specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view, displayed in the content of recorded variables. appears usually in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, where all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions listed. appears usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view, in which the output (as shown in HTML) is shown. appears usually in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything is available or part of the following functionality.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this promotion, the connection to debugger, if required, or it divides the Plugin with, on Debugantry. this action is triggered by default, so that a debugger is used, so that normally it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or ends the leaves according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to introduce a Debug requirement. this is equal to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is shown in the debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points the debugger to start with the execution of the script and the currently introduced line continuously. if this happens, while the script is continuing, the execution will be continued before a Debugantry is started, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information about overgrowth variables and the current line number. if this is done while a script is given, the execution, as soon as a request is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger introduces the next statement in the script, without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next statement in the script, with if possible in functions and include in error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to overgo the instruction and go to the next, as if there were not current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialogue, in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the awaking value appears in the variation view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialogue a variable should be entered or a new value of a variable will be set.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Eedit packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantum; it is used to provide support for market and scripts. their simplicity and flexibility is made of & quantitative; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for WEBENTWICKLER, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two ways, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script language and / CSS; and TagXML files containing the extension .tag.toolbars are handful, symbolically oriented lynoses (above the editing window), the text and instructions can add faster into a document as one user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), download or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details about transformation.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as layout and content of the Featuresrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars permit a fast insertion of tags in a document without any danger of a typewriter.</seg>

<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the conference XML and clear whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so many users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and limitations is placed in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML documentation. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain definition of many tags, but it contains only element type over itself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using is & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for meeting class class. the name of the basic class for this class. (Family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (Family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has common attribute group and the attributes inside this tags can be added to any other day. (Family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialogue. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a merely element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it also sets the names and type of attribute. additionally, it contains further tags that may be displayed as this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes of the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantum; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of a interface. the dcop methodology within & quantum; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting and methodology. the arguments that are handed over to the method. can be empty or% tagame%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list together. it can only occur in an Attribute description only once. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of an tags inside a dialog. this day can occur only once in a dialog (e.g. for each attribute; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and the size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a merely element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must begin with a & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be closed properly and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Space character influence nothing, but watch out & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; Toolbox &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; can be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools dialog can start in & quantum; -Window to start and check tagXML. a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. at present, check-out only when charging the TagXML files in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this conference XML file is supposed to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 conference XML file. in this file, a & PHP; transition function will be described. the file name of this conference XML file shall be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed by DTD edit DTD. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; it should be created for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries will be created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] Version = using 1 for & quantitative; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD / / EN) nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A promotion can set up action actions... created. click on New Action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keychain that this action is defined. with clicking the button user can be assigned a button closure; with Keiner is the current key limit.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The most simple actions. a text can be entered in the Detailiated Settings and insert this text in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to modify or use the document or as input (or parts of the document); examples are the fast-start dialog or the various See in... promotions for the (X) HTML-DEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% script.shone / scripts local script file: $KDEDIR / share / apps / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document it is file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantum; -process will be replaced by & quantitative; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantum. from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script input can be obtained from & quantum; on the default input. in the selection box input can be determined, which is to be submitted to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the launched application can also be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal issue, based on the default error. it can be specified, which should be done with the text specified on the standard edition by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. in the case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window, starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the Tag Attributes and you plan to plan your use, enable you to edit dialogue "Day" when available, so that an input using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in combination with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better, we will use & jonedit; choose from the & menu menu;, graph further programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& Gonedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22 to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a button labeled as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually considered as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will show that clicking on this symbol will be attached; -day in current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol there is still to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantitative Population;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue to continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative; functions for tool bar and it should be shared this to a better overview through some Trenner into several groups. make sure the toolbar can be selected via settings of toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I'd like to choose the Trenner (top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the Elementary, which is to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the cross-queror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner will support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by probate all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">In the proper file. after reeXML does not exist, it will create impediments, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that your tool bar will be loaded (n) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notorious expansion of & quantitization; for the normal users the ability to add documentation for the script language or the formatting language you like. this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantum; -Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. let the first part we leave you to treat the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = input 1.html Section 2 = 1.Sec2.1, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.html 1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag.html-3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible section of documentation in the document tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation is such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc you = php4.2 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 = Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Ultrut.html... Language Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = Basic Reference = html-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is about sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for chess set (except for reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents are directly referenced directly to a file (and at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space character influence nothing, but watch out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaports; Resourceases should be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is to be displayed on the frame of the context-sensitive help. by marking the function called and pressing Ctrl _ fetch _ array function, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc as well as $HOME / .kde / Doca / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and it's worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to the & quantum; -Community. they will not be rich, but proud of being able to join the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantum affected; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or else to whom. at different places, there is an email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantum changes; users can download them and only available if our team needs them as correct and fully used for publication, which is guaranteed to provide a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources are guaranteed, both for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked to demand for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can continue to select one. in the dialogue New resource you need to continue to remain empty) and then click on the upload of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload and upload toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantum; the integrity of the resource due to the integrity and significance. in case of problems, the integrity have been carefully warning. if the integrity have been given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originates of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages which is currently not generated by & quantum. however, creation can be used as time consuming a DTEP package could be necessary because hundreds of day files can be used in day XML format. there is easy way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target range: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definitions shown in the! doctype Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD / / DTD / TR / html4 / loose.dtd will appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, scores & quantitative; after the conversion to the new & DTEP Editor, the details of the newly created & DTEP may be adjusted; it is recommended to use this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantum Saul, there are some key concepts. to understand these and complete benefits from & quantum; therefore, one must first bring together with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring to them exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantum; the working range is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who is selected & quantum; it is possible to ensure that in the common folder structure of & quantum; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are custom-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user list, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all of & CSS; -patterns of up to workpieces with special promotions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all the employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantum; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the managgregation, the antagonists with information and the tool bars. please do in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the cardboard box with the right mouse button to receive a text menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all Karteirev, recharging, erase or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangle in the editor range lead to a further context menu on the illustrated document screen, such as basic machining steps (cut / copy / insert), editing the text below the mouse button, or open the file, if the string amongst the mouse button is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor, the tool bars of the editor are currently taking & quantum; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard, for which a set of tool bars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantum, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and thereby linked user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, for example & lt; you want to insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The manoeuvre (QIT;) enable you to navigate in the information about and quantum; to navigate, to open and walk through. in the presentation of Karteireites are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, which provides & quantum. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project via right mouse click. actions like adding, removal, upload or deleting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the following text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantitization; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: images, program parts, whole website & etc; there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on the & quantum. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are only usable in the project. read more about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information on the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script will send or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the cursor will display the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on a element, the cursor will be placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking a element opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and recovery of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other types of construction. with it can change manquickly Attributes and namespaces. the modification of all available attributes with a few clicks can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development. we can download the documentation for & quantum; the documentation site can be created, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative information; two Karteirev in the lower end of the window can be reached via the usherding information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in quantity of current script. for example, the DTD uses the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all errors in the current document of the current document. & quantitative error; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantum number; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantum; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email. & quantitative error; when they receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure them in & quantum; like any others secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantum; files on your system. for this, autoconf can pass a number of options that can be given to the configure script. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at the starting point of & quantum; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder contains. you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before I am Folder. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantum Saul; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantum increase; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a well-equipped development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, developers began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be, if & quantum. an independent, extendable Markup-languages editor? well, this would make him a completely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. if you can define it in & XML, then it should be & quantitative; for that the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantum; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; it is not only possible this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantified; such as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative gains; this enables the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase the productivity of almost every task. by means of self-painted actions, scripts and toolbars. through the program compost they can understand & quantum. (more then find them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for rapid web development and quickly developed to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & quanta; the original developer left the GPL license and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detailed documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & querqueror; enter, or execute helpcenter help: / quantitative a).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quantitative; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file that is not taken on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. check in the section via templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project management board, only an error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to insertion from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; alert, so it is displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as formattening assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -Sign which is the correct way to insert special characters and space characters in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Automatically switches the recorder to resp. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the Shift + Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Seek a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the window windows or not. that's the window, where you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">- and switch-old of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantum. the problem of problem is activated when one changes to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol links to the main window. this column allows you to set a bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries predictive or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmark from other opened documents in the menu, grouped according to the filenames of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantum affected; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialogue to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that could be there. this allows for example graphics files in your project file or subfolder and then add to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantum affected; the project is administrated. in chapter & quantum, -projects you will find details in detail.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialogue to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new tool bar. this creates only the name. actions need to set up actions... added. toolbars are stored via toolbars of toolbars or you are asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removed a tool bar from the viewpoint. you don't delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you are asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Thus you can send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantum); team, thus the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu option opens a new EMail message with the tool bar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars on the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or anything else has made and convert into the & quantum; own anti-use format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / refresh the Entities from the & DTD; it is sensible if the removal of the & DTEP is to be renewed, without the whole & DTEP; if this global is not present and a write permission in the global KDE file fails, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool bars. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific signatures.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantum changes; the insertion is refuted when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu, the available plug-ins listed below the menu listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Chooses the syntaxable mode for the current file. the list of available herbypass schemata depends on the works; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Chooses the type of line identification. very useful if you know people know the other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS, or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document based on selected & DTD; using the external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card mode that is also the default setting mode, or the lower window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides a entry for each open window. with selecting a contract, the corresponding window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantum. major henna respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue covers any application that use the HTML part, including the & conqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judging the behaviour of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialogue appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbars or add which you can change and follow the series.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce an assistance according to the field of the mouse button, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative percentage; is a high quality product that freely available and freely licensed, but as in each open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support & quantum; -development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed by the best of the project, as the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantum; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log is used. depending on adjustment of the remote computer, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files are used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local filesystem into the project. you can select multiple files or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change static web content you want to download and change. with serverable scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be tied. if a project is redesigned, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Using this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main character and you can make a precise selection of good.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by check or, through removing the hematology, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can also instantly upload the project properties in the menu area in the menu area Profile or with the key shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder are possible), which will be re-read on project-related operations like the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded during opening the project, can be found in more about projections.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is available in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the button options. in the troubleshooting will be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the lower window profile, high ladeprofiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, pointer a dedicated construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the lower window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the lower window event configuration, one can switch event actions and add these actions, change or erase. event actions are executed if a particular event takes place, such as the sickle of a file. see in details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantapnation opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not be used at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantum message; closed, the project file will be stored automatically. you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving; changed files. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management provides free access to the files in the project. there you can manage files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are similarly ready, however, the entries must be opening and open with... within the right mouse button on the following text menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find different profiles. the profile contains information on the site of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only longer exists a profile, the button will be blown to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and forgetting it. this option is useful if required uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk option does not come in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantum cases, many high-loading profiles can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied onto the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO Slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this must not be changed unless the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave this is either a time saving function or a danger. do not use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so that it can not be read simply, but each with programming knowledge can be easily seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A projection view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simply diligence of view, several files and toolbars can replace and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu project or project tool, can be saved or deleted from the toolbars project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantum algorithms; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but allows to adapt to & quantitative adjustments to its own work.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantum. preferably on the menu toolbars. use and adding itself. adding to the toolbars in the section adding of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be adjusted either by context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which a new tool bar can be removed, tool bar lock or toolbars can be implemented, which can be specified in the dialogue, where actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to one action (symbol) on a tool bar, in addition, the entries will be removed and action work that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up on them in the menu with Settings toolbars... and set the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essential documenting, code schnitzel and files to link. we can copy, postpone or any part file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any at the system existing directory in the storage room. templates have set in & quantum. in about the restrictions you can set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitization; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions on each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be included in documents by text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary form (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / URL). some examples are found in the storage room under global templates. more information on templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents may be written by each text-document type. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. usually, more documents can be found in appropriate undertakers. some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates. see in more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is based on a template but the same text area always will be included in documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the storage room under global templates. see for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name suggests, these templates are organized for all the sites as templates. you are a collection of different documents that can be arranged in a folder with a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Shape a document structure to Believe (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file As a template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as it is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the project room under project management.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file As a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn with pulling and put on the site templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only enough in a single file folder. you can use all the file management functions, such as pulling and paste or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a file in the file tree or in the project files, select a name for the template and secure a name for the template. by default, it can be saved in the project file, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project management systems enable a very targeted preference. you can add headlines and headlines or dynamic with & PHP; create files, insert files or connected with them. in addition, you can keep some things in the use of templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the lower window templates is based on the files in the $KDEDIR / share / apps / template / template / template / template / template / template / template. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to determine the behaviour of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button to select and in the context menu properties:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is aborted, as soon as the terrestrial attributes is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except for the regular folders in the template. if a regular folder would be enabled, it would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text tree. if nothing appears, it is probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Permits or downstream text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines and lines for all templates for a specific project and allows to equip all templates in a folder with special headlines / footer with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, use the context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) via a full command set for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative account; two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second will execute the editor window in two parts: the source code and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a Cursor appears. then you can edit and activate the source code editor, which are visible in the source code in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor is still necessary to modify this code editor. there is no plans to change these behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that, at the same time, the cursor is activated in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously runs in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor of this mode is already active, the button pressure is the active cursor from a window to the other, whereby the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. according to choice of VPL; you can automatically choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be adjusted automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a great span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select the document of invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor, as soon as a new document is created with VPL; editor, which serves as a new document with the VPL editor. this allows for this to change:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allows storing information on the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. one click into the list allows the change of inhalted, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change on the list is possible as with the meta elements. the processing of CSS rules is not yet supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind a external CSS styling system by selecting the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor of the cursors is as in a word processing, possible due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves very strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by typing and via backsliding or distances to be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way about the tool bars as stated in the source code editor. it is necessary to note that the insertions are not removed beforehand, e.g. an anchor day, surrounded by text, each other surrounding anchors are removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the tables-assistant or the lists-assistant are disabled. they will be used later in & VPL; in this release, tables or lists can be used in this release.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously corrected the retention at the same time. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts during merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me could only show me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed inside this lines. and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the objection was changed. this changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes on white characters. later, lots of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare quickly text for example, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are working independently from each other on a piece of code and displays changes. in this Editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit three Quell files at the merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you in the same and a complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and are similar to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check the code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in column at the left side. (no trouble anymore if no one changes the retention.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in one row, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily facilitate the file names by using only the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder folder / diff3 folder folder / diff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3-o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows the manual typing of filenames, the selection via the file-browser (file...) or select a last open file from the list. opening dialog, you don't have to specify a third file. if you do not leave the file for C, the analysis of the differences with two files are done.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a file, the comparisons or merge of folders will be initiated, for B and C, however, is a folder, then use & kdiff3; file names from A into the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When assembling, the input field is active for the target and can be adjusted. however, it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would not like to compare all the file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard to the active comparative window. the comparison begins then you can't select any files you can simply connect the dialog with the break button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and insert: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall on a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how these functions are, it would have to compare two appropriate files, they get into & kdiff3; download and then compare these relevant sections to add, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at this moment you can find out of & todiff3; pull out only the text in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cut and insert (instead of copying and insert). in such case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional). (if the path is too long for a file, let the mouse rest a while on line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed over the Settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one sees the color which is different. if both files differ, the predefined color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). colour scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left beside the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the appropriate color. with some programming languages where white characters is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, e.g. white characters are only in strings and commentary, for the processor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column from the text, is interrupted at the digits, where the respective source file is enabled. if the line is activated, the line will be loaded on broken rows.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparative analysis) also has an information line with the inscription:, the filenames and [changes] if you have processed the result. usually it contains all text, but often also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!! until all conflicts are dissolved, storing is disabled!!! (do not use buttons to be found in the lowest / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative holes are used, each difference is to be solved in the same time a conflict that can be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this is also a jump in the position into windows where the group is otherwise not visible.) This group will be emphasized with the color background colour for current area and each on the left is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through automatic merge or manual processing, no further line remains in the group; then in these lines of text & lt; no line in the text is shown. this text is not only displayed in the final stored file, nor in a marking you may want to copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge compatibility; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the window window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments are as well as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with the image capture and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can also use the arrows keys on the left, right, at the end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the oversafest column next to the vertical screen row can also be used to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to do. with the insert button, you can switch between single and overmode mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the context and the editable output window was declared).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / last difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-down) or to the next / previous post (Ctrl-Down Taking) or to the next / previous post (Ctrl-Down Taking) or the next / previous post as a conflict. hence, between dissolved and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is activated, you will automatically copy the clipboard automatically and the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenching are saved according to the underlying operating system. UNIX variants use a line-in-line character\, and Win32-based systems use car reboot\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line-up of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be stored automatically and restored at the next start. (pop up menu &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a writing with fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italic writings are displayed. if the chosen writing does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors cannot be available in their pure form but would be shown. on these systems the button settings will automatically set an odd color automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab button. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you return input or return, the transfer of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, any selection will be copied automatically into the clipboard. the manual is going to copy in the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which Zeilenende type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used option on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When you try to find files & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines will be ignored in the source file. only during this first step, white characters are ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. also, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a ripping mark '\' at the end of one line, other again save only one line of line '\'. usually, files can be seen with different sizes in side-side comparison, but then you could only use a white characters. while this option must be disabled, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.', '-'). in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense still search for smaller differences. this option is activated in the default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic resp mode, this setting is determined, as long as the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unged conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatically all conflicts in white characters by choosing the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you need to get better the functions elecle A / B / C for all ungeldest white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection are also available in numbers or comments if the options are to ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning folders and implementation of a merge. look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is the Suffix .original file. if already such a backup file with the Suffix .original file, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of user interface. this option does not affect the current programme. you have to finish & kdiff3; terminate and restart the change. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available since the language is set up over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be configured separately for any entry. if you activate this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for the coding appears a short notice of what the local coding is. (this can't be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this implies how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have selected a file, you can define what code is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can define the coding of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off to suppressing any changes in white characters into the text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a color-coded overclock column are displayed. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; B, A & lt; C or B & lt; C is shown next to the normal or second supersafest column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. use the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparison window appeared next to each other or overlap. this can also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes look at the differences and then decide to merge the files in the merge menu. a simple click starts the merge and use the filenames of the last source file as a preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & todiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example to cut out or correct your own preference.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), then the output of the command is only used when the command file is equal. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. every input line has to have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to enable the user to enable more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, most users do not want to program this. the good news is, however, in most cases pulsed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">In this context, use this pre-processing command to convert: SED's /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you may be able to understand and perhaps you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is well as an example of a further pre-processing command for Zeilenable.sed 's /' [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hits will be replaced by nothing so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple shots at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the reasons from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different like perl. perl -p -e's / switch 'allerdings are different at perl some details. where to sed\\\\\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal Preprocessor will maintain and maintain. further operations only change the data that sees the line-off-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal Preprocessor, the line-off-Preprocessor sees the output of the normal Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with every function, the text changes or differences are hidden, you can not notice any differences in the worst case and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers have to process many files in a folder. you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can emulate the merge and display the simulated changes without it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, uses & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start, do not interfere with the merge, press the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (additional details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder you will inform you a small news window over current progress. if you break the folders, only the files are listed, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folders found during the scan is found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure will normally be folded. you can click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the building or by clicking the arrow keys on the left / right. the directory menu includes two functions of all subdirectories, and all subdirectories can be loaded with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a double file, the file will start the same and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such case the merging-up action can not be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, are used in the columns A / B / C the colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders are the same color. in case of folders, the age is unexpected for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colours of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow will be and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B is not exists, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a file and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types exist. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if a file and B a file is): errors: contradictory data types. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder was given and if the config file is synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action is identical to that both folders are identical.</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible file names for the output file only B; directly after merge & coldiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be phased, then check & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors cannot be removed, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merger, a file will display a file after the other. if the merge was successful, and correspondingly other messages when doing something unexpected, you should make a final review and see if the status is all right in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the setup dialog is chosen for comparative analysis, KDiff3 will display further columns. these include the number of newcomers, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only appear when three folders shall be compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You may either execute the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all together-feeding actions (even in all subtypes), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified the target folder, then in the Three-folders mode C is used as a target, the two-folders will be chosen as a target and for synchronising A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure, there are some options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key prefix). to run only the latest entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through contradictory file types, there are still invalid actions, a message appears on the faultless elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options, simulate and aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you first want to see what would happen without having done really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window (please note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, select your directory merge / continue or press F7. if you still have not saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of this list you will see some error messages that can help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you choose the problem to select a different action for the entry or to solve the problem in any way before you continue with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been assembled individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not be stored at the later together. even if the merge has been overflowing or not saved, these entries are used as done. only if you will change the merge action, these entries will again be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Killing 3...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the indicated pattern will be displayed in the element tree. separate samples are entered with a semicolon; valid space holder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not indicated in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separators. valid space holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not indicated in the elementary tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separators. valid space holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically produced files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder specifically can be configured with a .cvsignal file. (see below info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a hiding place attribute. in other file systems this option is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic linking are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is activated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched on, the links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links are treated as normal folder and recursive. (note that a link to a file that contains a link to itself would lead to a endlosse and & kdiff3;) This option is displayed in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics-columns. (the number of dissolved, unstable, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binaries analysis, and much slower, if it is applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files via a slow network, it is possibly faster, only changing date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of safety. please use this option in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidential date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical if they are equal to, if you use the change date lost. please use this option in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two files are compared and no target folder was given. in this mode, the suggestions are identical. in this mode, the proposals are identical to both folders. this option is displayed in both folders. this option is displayed in default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file will be proposed as action. (this will be considered insecure, because it will not verify that the other file doesn't change.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file will be replaced or deleted by another file, then the original version is renamed and will receive the extension .original if an old backup file will be deleted with the .original extension file, this option does not only affect the normal merge file, not only the merge file. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-merge view is visible to the merge of individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch the window and text window, the main window can switch on the window and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file with double-click navigating menu. however, you can run a single file also directly together without the folder. if you want to save the file, the status will be closed down and the file will not run once again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you read the directory: directory -menu: read more</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO-Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders that are opening on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax for local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file is: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be differentiated whether a link is shown on a file or a folder. then it will always be a link to the link target. (FTP: sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to process permissions or change date. therefore, turn the permissions or change date from the original. (please note the option confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of the purpose is currently as a differences viewer in the Develop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in differences viewer. in order to start Killing 3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a box, take & kdiff3; the name of the original files in the Unified format is. then it takes and kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. additionally, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the box mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now is it comely) there is already. furthermore, the name KDiff3 shows that it can result in such as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs very long and I have learned a lot when I looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go to it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have been compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably not indicated the right PREFIX to KDE. in the default, configure resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white characters is different, the line will not be treated as the same. iF similar Lines. next to Each other, this is this kind of soli-the-case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor note for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this important information is however lost if the result is simply stored as text file and it's too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit a larger quantities of text, another Editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly rinsed; No src lens; appeared and the text can't be extinguished. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to emphasize differences of differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. do not use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and trouble reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the features of & kdiff3; you will need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; you can compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the basic folder of the & todiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system, installed in the KDE. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems at the compilation. if you should have difficulties, please report on the & kde; mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out into the clipboard and remove the selected text. inserts (Ctrl-V or switch-to-insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folder will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder to these options with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to feature differences. this also includes that identical files will not be copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behaviour is likely to be modified in a later program version.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed during the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is deactivated. underpups in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpens; shows a minipreview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to watch the ongoing programs on the working areas to change their size or move it. this works both in mind and with multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpens; can display all virtual work areas as well as the ongoing applications. applications can be selected and can be moved on your desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The middle mouse button can be moved within & kpager. the movement can be moved within a desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The text menu depends on how the right mouse button is clicked on, if on the empty background of & kpens; however, the context menu only include the two entries in Pager. however, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on counter and end. the commands will work the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of mind. appears only if it has been clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if a application has been clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows within the & pager, can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this box is crossed, are displayed in & kpens; the name of the virtual workspace will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & kpens; show the numbers of virtual workspaces. it is interconnected together with name, will be provided with the ordinator numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this box is crossed, the background of every desktop is also displayed as a background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this box is crossed, the ongoing programs are displayed as small windows in & kpens; otherwise only the empty workspace will appear to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol indicates the window with its standard symbol and pixel map displays a small view of the actual program command. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & pens; head office can be determined, well known as Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally shows all virtual workspaces in a horizontally and perpendicular in a vertical series, which is very good for displaying on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpens; may be used as an alternative to Pager Miniature in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with its content, and also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent selecting from switch-switch... will appear the dialog settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can not be changed in the dialog settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you must register as user root or enter your system administrator. in this file you have to enter the keys windowTransparent mode and point to this one value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & kpens; part of the packet base is required, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer pains in the same place (RSI) syndrome and to whom each mouse click pains. furthermore, it can emulate the mouse with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can circumvent the pain, which emerges with the mouse button, and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer pain using the use of your computer. if you are suffering from the use of your computer, you should not take a doctor if this is not yet to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to realise it again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid pain which are caused by the mouse button, it is used against pain, which is caused by the use of the mouse, used as well as with all ergonomic aid supplies: the result can fall for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you interrupted the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent relocating is enabled, & kmousetool; a break after pressing the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse. in this way, you can execute the pulling when pressing the mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a bit exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before & mousse tool; a mouse click is out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the opposite is turned on, the turning field shifts (1 / 10 s) is active here. here, the time is set, the mouse button is waiting before the mouse button is waiting, if there is no evidence for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicking through the mouse button. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to move the response time. open the & control centre, go to Sound & Multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider of sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please check the relevant documentation to find out how to automatically start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings on the values, which were adjusted when opening the dialogue. have you already pressed the button User button, the settings are reset on the stand after the final pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, intelligent relocs should first be switched off. if you are then used to the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it's necessary to reduce the activation of & kde; in connection to sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should deliberately make sure to take a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent link. you can use the mouse to park in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse ruckles, you should clean your mouse. it is usually rather simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that use the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, the mouse is too different from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear if you see the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the Loches, into which the ball was used. dirt and soiling can easily be scratched with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system has started the execution of & kmousetool; when just use a shift operation, this means that & kmousetool; operation does not mean more through the leave of a mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter text, tries to execute & kmousetool; continue to execute mclicks and sets the cursor to another job.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to make it. however, use the mouse on a neutral range of desktop, if you don't want to make sure that the mouse button are unintentional reactions. safe zones for the mouse pods are & cover; the grey areas around the tool bar and menus and the titlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shift, but I can't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent relocs is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you want to move it into the clipboard to move it into the clipboard to move it into the clipboard to move it into the clipboard. but there will probably be some problems with them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shift when you just start to start & kmousetool; select text instead as follows: perform at the end of the text area a mouse click and hold the switch-down key while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this allows you to play a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the intelligent shift starts. later you can use the intelligent shift without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you must use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible clicks is available only if the system has a sound card and speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; entered the mouse button as soon as the mouse pounded short. this program was developed for people who are suffering from the RSI syndrome and those of the mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for the normal work with & ktts; filter is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the program-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker to handle certain defects of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the mode of filters, it is important to know how the program works "No-dispatcher" with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the edition of the Screen reader is read, the received orders will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has precedence and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you & eg; a long text can be read on a website, you can welcome to & kmouth; someone welcome you just enter the room. & kde; notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textorders. each order that allows you to attach from the board card orders, is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that have text orders. text orders are thought for the output longer than the issue, which have no special delicacy.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are working in queue-long, with the exception of the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends out the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such reads, this edition will pause and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen reaids. they are applied on normal warnings, news and text agreements as well as on & kde; -News applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">The filter process the text and specify it to the next filters. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are implemented as modules. in the future, there can still be more kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replace parts of a text by other text. the required parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions. it is provided with the predefined character string profiles, which enable the correctness of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; transducers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; included in a format into a different format. there are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaking options, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, send the text on & ktts; if you have set a female voice on the board card, you can read text by KDE news about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has been adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a language issue. if the filter is determined that its rules does not exist, he will continue to follow the text to the next filters.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text contract, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent, it will be arranged by all activated filters, which have been installed on the page below. the processing of the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2638">To set up a list of words or regular expressions as a comparative sample, these samples are found in the text, then the text will be exchanged against the appropriate replacement text. big and small case will not be considered by comparison.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two kinds of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDB filters). thus, I can read off the first proposition as only the first proposition should be synthesized, not the whole text contract. in this way, you can also return on the card orders a full-pass or jump, even if the language synthesizer does not support them directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional filters. when the first start of & ktts are automatically set up. you can change its settings or add further propositional filters, but will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest way, you can easily read the selection of the talking selection and enter text for example. check out the spreader selection, change some properties and check out how to have the choice of talk. for this purpose, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the pre-read, since only the first movement can be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then get text orders then on the card card orders, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal satzlimitry filter will automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, but do not change anything at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The text form and text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tampoule sign (decimalcode 8) to the set limit (tampoules are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard propositional filters retains the strings.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter has never been applied to & kde; -News (cold), warning, messages, or the output of Screen-Readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional filters, you can add this again by calling the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>

<seg id="2740">Select here the characteristics of the desired talk. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box when the property is intended to have other features. you can also set up several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor for understanding, it is always possible to specify this property. the only case where you might specify the attribute language, if you know that a certain application will be sent in another language than that of the working environment.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the card audio, there is a setting speed. thus, this works, the program SOX must be installed and on the ambient variable PATH. some synthesials such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when & mts; & HTML. (this is that the HTML version is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xyz file of the & HTML; -to-SSML conversion filter, and set up the microphone speed up.</seg>

<seg id="2797">Best you can use a command that writes the speech output in a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & control center; which allows the administration of network interfaces, routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & control center; allows users to manage a series of system and desktopsettings about a unified, integrated surface. the & control center; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to allow the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & colcontrolcenter will be displayed. network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can't install. physical devices and their drivers have already been installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device ever displays and setting up the network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases device drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux. network devices will be added later, the drivers must be reloaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings will be loaded when the network settings in the & control center; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings the module tries to automatically detect the platform installed on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can't be detected, the hanging selection is offered. it is the platform from list which is best to be taken permanently. due to the setting of the setting, non-re-questions can be taken permanently. at the next start of network settings then this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means, the settings can only be considered. in the system management mode you can click by clicking on the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices will be displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings attached network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button interface... in the dialog device can be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only the TCP / IP settings are available. click on the button Extended Settings shows the dialog with incoming possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of automatic TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP Server, all required TCP / IP information on any system start, so there's no further adjustment required. in the selection list may either select DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selecting Manually, without DHCP or BOOTP can be made to the TCP / IP address. in the input field IP address you need to specify the desired TCP / IP address. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initialized the network interface on booting. if the initialization will not be desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values specified in this dialogue are displayed as properties of the device in the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. ping up an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping into the & console, you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch-off of an switched network device is done by selecting from the list and click of interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch off an activated network device is selected by selecting from the list and click of interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which mediates the physical link to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than a network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the net, where the gateway computers is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support is replaced by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if computers http: / / www.einedomain.org is required, DNS dissolves this name into an IP address like about 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the equestrian name resolution allows simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed or modified. DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single contract, or down to the list with the buttons or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will add the dialog for New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add. the entry will then be included in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution choose a entry and then click on the Edit.... It will display the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known calculator describes the computer-to-IP address reference to the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily by booting when no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks, it can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of well known hosts contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. these are still available in the review of IP in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar hosts and click on adding.... The dialog of New also is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host and click the button Add. if the well known calculator has multiple alias names, turn button adding several times and enter the other also known as names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry-known computer screen from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit the calculator is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">There can be one of the following tasks, then with clicking on OK, the list of the static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings defined in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, in one & console; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage from & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package to download and in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical surface like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to recompile users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second, all by & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about integration of the PC will be mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). this description has never been found great distribution. IPv6 is expected in the near future. this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to be aware of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator, which is a valid IP address, or if available, dhcCP can be used. definitely, the IP address can not be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP address counter with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded during the Internet, so its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, you can access the Internet for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mains mask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all machines are at the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for IP transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section, the configuration files located by & knetworkconf; are affected and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed with DSL connections, so it is not surprised to find any content specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand can therefore occur as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a safety program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a band. the first goal was to create a surface for tar which offered my wife. the second goal was the answer of a question that took my wife: how much longer lasts it if you set?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be made by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; trained the band back and reads the prestressing of the tape. recognizes & dat; the pronunciation on the tape will not be asked if the band is formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol of the tape drive, to show that the tape was inbound. in the Status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the bandes can now be searched for the tape through unfolding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before discard the tape, first the integration process must be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives an amendment to the symbol for the tape that the integration was solved by the band and shows an appropriate message in the Status bar. the band can now be cast out without any danger.</seg>

<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to specify changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes that all files are secured and a new snapshot file is used for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be set:</seg>

<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to upgrade a machine on System V init without a new installation and reformwork. this is why you need to make sure the old init was removed from there if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV init also differs from BSD init that the configuration files in a sub-folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you would like to start on another Runlevel. system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail; system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only be launched. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should also be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it's actually not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.conf / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and it starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and likely to change that the pre-set Runlevel 3. if you want to change this, then you can repair / etc / inittab, then you can repair it by using the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called to the argument. if it includes a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-level server, which can only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; you could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say no trivial: simply pull a entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also modify scripts between Runleveling or modify the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only do not occur if you pull out an entry from the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved, if you want to copy these in a new field. to copy them only to a new runlevel, you need to add them out from the menu Edit or from the context menu - even then, if the same entry already exists in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries, which were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to enable the various workareas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper or below.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move a entry into another Runlevel, turn it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired round level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorter number or the name of a single entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by pressing the key button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require a confirmation before being executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc), if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; reproduced. changes to the settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevels, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & colsysv; intended for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services are launched in these distributions, does not simplifies the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are required (and even if you are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) can easily end without notice when their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send us information about Runlevel, so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it's enough to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save this. either you use the corresponding icon of toolbar or entry to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two Kartell cards, user and user group. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears a dialog user or group Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cases can only be displayed if you have enabled system settings. only if you can make space restrictions (Quota) for users, a carton card can be set on which you can make individual settings, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password will appear if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD, are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears to be activated and initialized for at least one embedded file size limitation (Quota) and initialized (recognizable at the quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, for every user parameters, the space restrictures can be changed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set separately for each file system. the current file system will be selected using the field of field filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the Group's underlying values of the selected user. the default group, to which the user is, will find in the field of prime group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the Group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select from the menu user or group or click the matching add-button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the lilo boot manager, remove the boot word, remove and change the time to boot from the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change, change, change and more.</seg>
