although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American music dance , American writers and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a pro@@ found effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ student who had the Supreme Court with judges who had his interest to his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method Man , &quot; I was it as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything that I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had a very shy love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of its asc@@ ension is to me as he goes with his narrow face .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so nice .
he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and declared publicly its cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless the people responded to his statements and tuned to him for him .
the 13 million votes which he won with the republi@@ can vote was the highest number ever achieved by the party of nominated candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ u@@ ck person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters not with people in harmony I had met myself during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic program , taking people from around the world , a deep gl@@ itter@@ ing human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , tr@@ um@@ ps also voted by Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; agreed .
Bh@@ atia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced for Sandy B@@ ahr who fights for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son .
yet it fits with the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those through them deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump on his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they had a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the meditation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either shared by rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost the heart beat me .
perhaps it is not fair to design@@ ate the dump @-@ voters than R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people submit , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
that is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act on another way and thinking .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters are voted , of which most of them are tuned for Tr@@ ump , because they want to recover the control of a country that has disappointed it ?
in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with regard to those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. the WC . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ity &quot; ; word game made of white in response to the white and whi@@ ch@@ ma ) , as the big Van Jones called it exactly what America has so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America is always welcome .
for this country was chosen as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says he would be possible somewhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white of America this promise and says : to Hell with versat@@ ility , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 the white man is back again at the Ru@@ der , they say .
at all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who fell down in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd covered the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone could , who is not like you , a place in your US ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was ordained .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart to me .

from the affliction to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ian city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , does not only change the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill station , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby cant@@ onal ruins and its world famous kitchen .
for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and the Ban@@ e violence .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth offered so a rare hop@@ el@@ iness .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI said :
once they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch race them through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically in the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital city - on instruments which are made from recovered waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under management of Fa@@ vio Chávez thus began to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion who were all produced from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ic and Latin American music as well as music by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Chávez rec@@ alls a local eco @-@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the beginning of :
first it was very difficult because we had not had space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same position , the children had not known music and it was very difficult to contact their parents , because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something which he had never seen : one out of a waste has produced violin .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from restored material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
every year , the world generates about one billion metric tons of waste .
those who live with him and live by him are the poo@@ rest - as people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational show of gar@@ bage @-@ to music around the world .
the orchestra has played its music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting .
this post written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted for international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of Content .
in West Africa this ship was known that this ship had already operated in Liberia fishing waters before the other coast of Africa began .
the eastern African countries were brought accordingly to this and slightly incl@@ ined to call a law of this species to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refused to spend one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that simply refused everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered the ship in the day and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not managed to catch the fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the pill@@ aging of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa was founded as a network of countries around the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally ( Il@@ legal fish@@ eries ) in 2012 .
the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had driven out the Premier of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus we have eight countries that are simultaneous and work together . they share information from and stand on each other , where there is illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is being caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to send it because it is illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a del@@ ik@@ ates equilibrium .
however , while actions against illegal fishing was once ob@@ struc@@ ted by bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles and through the s@@ nail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions now happen in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange the lists of existing licenses , news of susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships to detect ships in forbidden areas - some such that suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships .
ideally , such studies show whether the involved ships have a fish catch , where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries that are against illegal fishing can be allowed on the basis of these information , then that the ships can not sell their cargo in their ports . and that they even could not be sold to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means the illegal fishing catch is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ber company dedicated to the struggle against illegal fishing companies in Africa and is also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH Network for every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms , attrac@@ ting the area of commercial fishing from around the world . among these even more illegal fishermen .
these practices and other actions include the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake license papers , speci@@ fying Ph@@ ant@@ asi@@ en@@ names , fish protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are using the lack of international cooperation and the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ bridge control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal fishing and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not start my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal conclusion tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investig@@ ative ships .
it has been exposed to criminal networks , distributed f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several dec@@ eit@@ ful ident@@ ities and found it volat@@ ile ships and found .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances and received .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system to help F@@ ISH @-@ i is supposed to be more precise ships .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed , also helps to open the Il@@ legal Shi@@ ps that likes to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st with Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO which also offers technical support with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems , which they cannot be saved by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different sources of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Maritime Organization Oce@@ ana platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be indicated by means of every single tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; gather with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he just makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and protect their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project , with which a global system permits persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ ating but they are qu@@ en@@ ching .
ships that previously run without license and hardly any consequences had to be reck@@ oned with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i reported a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fish@@ eries has more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to open Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors took place on board locks , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that now other countries are able to copy us , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are going to disappear every hundred million dollars from illegal fishing every year .
there are six countries joined together in 2015 , at the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight the illegal fishing , after exactly the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the aim of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s recent member of Somalia was to report his first major triumph in October : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under false flag . not only was the ship to go on without a license and have been used to tow nets , which are now forbidden .
the ship was still incorporated in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; with the take @-@ of @-@ rules against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing catch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such a special , collab@@ orative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum to the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela was denied the request of opposition to a referendum , the Vene@@ tians re@@ acted , in whose eyes negotiations over the political and economic crisis of the country , when they gathered themselves to the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) , both pictures of this demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the country estate of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central North of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation in the country deterior@@ ates continuously , what happens in everyday life of the Vene@@ tians through a acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro saw the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately , the abol@@ ition of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Dí@@ az , co @-@ acting Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the following article in the context of government statements as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate in the world include the inflation rate of food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to conquer the country to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the election campaign of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or briefly Mu@@ d ( about : round Table of the Democratic Party ) , who joined the opposition to the National Assembly , in which the proceedings against the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro came into the way , and a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ elan government , should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum on November 3 .
the call was comments on Twitter , as follows :

the first demonstration in the context of the Action Program &quot; The Return to Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the images of Mär@@ ries , which are published in real time , testify to an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the safety signs : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she cri@@ es at this Vene@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter are pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and failure .
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the central North town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
in the local cathedral , demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to the police and armed forces of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ ier T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t carry a skirts because there is something else could see what many national runners do not have !
meanwhile , a inf@@ ographic is the round that forms the magn@@ itude of oppression a day :
so the dictatorship re@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the requirement for a minist@@ ering procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many people on the street .
My@@ t@@ ek Media Labs added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ feit .
here is your duties !
on the road !
other these protests as a further step in the fight against a government taken out of their perspective little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be busy , critical voices can be stopped :
you have taken us so much - but the fear too !
the mar@@ ches always take more on frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported the media to be hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of a interviews by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ix@@ ano , the origin of the origin on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and will be published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano was forced from his father , the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qu@@ ix@@ ano said in the context of the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in Cordoba &apos;s province of Cordoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes examined that were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano hasn &apos;t sought out his life .
starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father had to carry up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la , whom he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
he kept the family confi@@ denti@@ ality for 34 years .
in the situation I believed that was fine .
I felt like a sal@@ es@@ lean .
as a child with 15 years old you don &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not know that my father was a thief , Fol@@ lowing and Mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ chan@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Z@@ Per@@ la prison .

Archiv@@ ist .
this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ix@@ ano , the oppressed , which is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ jan@@ os son , a man who recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and said before a German court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent @-@ part over his child , and as this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take part in the military base , I often went into the sports hall . I had joined me with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been rounded off with one of the ERP .
pass just that they don &apos;t lead you one day , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
this is why he for@@ b@@ ade me to go into the sports hall . a few days later he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me I would be obe@@ is@@ ec@@ ent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . because so my father had gone me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university cl@@ as@@ ps , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks where cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blanket of wrapped par@@ cel and ordered me to wear it by car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in , and saw a lying lying , tor@@ tured on man .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it was attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was straight there .

years later when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this od@@ our .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time to work with me , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were spotted with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried out eyel@@ ids .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , an civilians who was also charged in the case ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were under the face down - all were folded in hands and feet .
near the entrance arch@@ ed people still stuck to the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father knew that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a d@@ unge@@ on and was buried by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were designated offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero collapsed there a man and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was also charged to the students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former fol@@ ly chambers .
the way , which you came in in , is also the way to come here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of un@@ human being .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be transferred .
this was the lie - of Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war yield was a ba@@ j@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military badge , which one takes an enemy , which one has fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... asc@@ ents , then there is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I am always asked how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered , and you who rode the car on the road ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before rage , and he cried , saying ,
if you come so far , then I will find you and bring you self @-@ hanging .
we do not need any other one !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then that I wore a jacket and a roll swe@@ ater from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a fellow worker in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay with me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to tell out .
&apos; the disappearance of the dead is the last cre@@ denti@@ fied A@@ kt &apos;
now where I am older , I feel dis@@ re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ated during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children lead ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always turned the question again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could just be able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do these bodies disappear ?
did those people not have families who were able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the dead is the last hat@@ ch@@ able act , which one can do a man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when the democracy was once again introduced to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were crushed and disp@@ ers@@ ed somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains always .
&apos;@@ i saw how you have killed people ! &apos;
just to say it : I have nothing against the military .
I even stayed with the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to show my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I tried him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience his account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have never been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt dis@@ rup@@ ted and asked me , for what all the bu@@ oy@@ ancy Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions , &quot; which they allegedly defended , was actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
you have committed suicide crimes and you forced me to participate as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only answered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I charged the first ad .
finally , I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ h@@ ort me that I am pre@@ set . I finally spoke against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ix@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest even before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 416 criminal charges : among them severe , un@@ tim@@ ely imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish to the magn@@ itude of judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 , committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims , finally in August .
43 Supp@@ orters of crimes against humanity was found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court was in@@ dem@@ ni@@ zed in 28 cases of prison and in nine cases of detention . in six cases they were acqu@@ itt@@ eth .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape through minist@@ ries . # Es@@ war@@ heads @-@ terrorism
all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military members , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was arrested along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by un@@ human heads .
the courts is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working for years on justice for many years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer , founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represent the children of people , who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government transferred the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial was erected there , which is now managed by human rights organisations .

an translation error makes older people in Kyoto for &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can leng@@ then its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers have been extended to a newly opened centre in which one can leng@@ then its driver &apos;s license , in the last month witnesses to a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( co@@ stum@@ ble sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means - but may also be translated with back@@ rest &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read more advertis@@ ements from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was used in the social media .
the mistake had fallen to the trans@@ lators of Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the fla@@ wed English translation has been removed first . the term &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mat@@ isch did not quite correct the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police pre@@ fecture of Kyoto pre@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , it declared that the error was already contained in the text , and that the translation was not tested for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the police said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News continued a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was refused as an appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers are wrapped in accidents that are nationwide in accidents , but certainly cause to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by the seniors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 had a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period .
the nam@@ ic not mentioned repor@@ ters brought in the version of the article comments on the light that show what pre@@ judi@@ ce some Japanese spoke against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation errors , among others , received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the translation is not bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery of these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are varied .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the output text and to be active language skills to transmit it into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of target - something that is in the case of mother@@ boards . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators may be in the target language - not in the source language - mother tongue should be .
a French native speaker should translate into English for example from English to French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue to make translation into English . this may be a lack of understanding of the over@@ flow , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , Japanese language .
some companies that have no foreign employees , however , do not have any foreign employees . then , the Japanese employee , whose English language knowledge is the best to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge are really good .

machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the resulting and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases which arise through machine translations , show that this technology can &apos;t replace many human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages .
some of the strange English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , often used T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry nor acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by big companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and protest action on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y S@@ oc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezu@@ elan Internet users have no access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet opening of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV could not be accessible .
also other online transmitter over@@ took photos of the protests in Caracas , which have been organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups to resist the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the Executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos Dí@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is linked , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan providers are again locked .
this is from the page by @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been in the reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with pen@@ alties and closure , when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked this as a &quot; Call to Viol@@ ence . &quot;
I have log@@ ged back to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and the informative national TV channels .
amazing that this continues to buy cheaper than two litres of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible , but also two more online broad@@ caster . this also applies the website to which the National Assembly broad@@ casts her meetings .
earlier research activities of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group of digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider would utili@@ ze DNS . this is a technique to answer the DNS server requests by certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ dent or denied the request when calling to such website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was discontinued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ camera is El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who took over the protests in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was located in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government was regulated , so that the government is regulated by Internet connections : thus the Vene@@ tians will keep access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become a slave to obtain training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for many years .
today , Tina for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo of C@@ eci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly auth@@ orization of Kur@@ n .
the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ n , who is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ender cows , exp@@ iring schools &quot; ) , which will be edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived in a budget for eight years in which she was not living together with the family that lived there .
shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , man , who are forced to work with more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the shop is very simple : a large family with little money over@@ lays her min@@ ors son or her min@@ ors daughter to another , more abundant family . at the exchange , the child gets food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned , is that the children must pay for many days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments - and all that can not be raised in the context of a contract that is not able to lift up .
this , known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance through large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go practice - collected witness statements , re@@ cher@@ ished and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ensuring breast@@ feeding in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then is the family that exclu@@ de her daughter in the faith , they conclude their position to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can do something from himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side stands the family that tak@@ eth up the girl with ones@@ elf and its exploitation by faith just@@ i@@ fies that they would not receive any training , otherwise it would not be an hung@@ ered .
the victims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military belonging to Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an officer at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ised that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society was responsible for the death of the girl .
you recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest conf@@ is@@ ations and demanded that there was no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions do boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations required a rapid investigation of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girls who her Cri@@ ad@@ ita was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
if the case before judgment comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay , the case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is in court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when Far@@ bi@@ k worked in which their father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still stayed time for learning .
she got every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , they clean the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished furniture and des@@ iring the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more time she had done with learning , the more free time she had .
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she was never hungry , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds her .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was part of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was part of the opposition from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings of the budget Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him are standing and editorial articles from opposition groups such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her to persu@@ ade the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he stayed them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ wife had found someone who heard about politics while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn more bad hab@@ its there , &quot; that they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ ani .
their Lord feared that they would not lose the education that she would lose her , explains it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her was completely clear that she had paid for everything that she had paid from them with their hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated in the school . &quot; a thing about which almost never spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans where Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school .
because the other children have their parents , they immediately know that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t have any friends at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the period where friends arise , I felt very clearly that I was not one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view job opportunities for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ovsky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my small daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to Learn .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a eleventh year girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country inner , which would like to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , the author of the ad postpon@@ ed another one :
Dear friends , I found one . I saw what it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was finished .
in the pro@@ blog about the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long yet ? ) , a collection of witness statements , Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice from early history ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ado@@ res , who received the Spanish conqu@@ erer country in Paraguay , and that the Spanish conqu@@ erer in Paraguay had to help them will@@ ingly , that many girls and boys are involved in a system of slavery , where they are given a slight sacrifice for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
legisl@@ ature writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
Pix@@ ab@@ ay image changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians had recently agreed a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of operation and commercial social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt during a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law then a passage would be arranged to use citizens , citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law the user would have to register users with their right names and number of staff to use social networks to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt is Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and are used to communicate with others by voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is thought when it is assumed that the draft may not affect the user &apos;s users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Abdul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liament@@ arians and promot@@ er of the Legislative Decree told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password , to get through the fire@@ wall , blocked Facebook .
this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those who would submit to the Egyptians for Egyptians , information on their identity , to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts and experts are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the fore@@ ground .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( on German &quot; senior research associate &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights , &quot; ) told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly on the technical capacity and the understanding of neither authority in Egypt regarding things to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that same as they are violent and private public and private rooms also control it online .
when I take them seriously , it means that it may apply a strong monitoring system to feed citizens , or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a court process .
this is technically not far real@@ ist@@ ically - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legisl@@ ature &apos;s legisl@@ ature and the Constitu@@ ency before being deb@@ ated into the plenary debate .
whether his adoption and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in which the sense is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a legislative bill against cy@@ c@@ crime , in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who were intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the Nor@@ theast of Iraq are the veter@@ inary surgeon H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature in Iraq to protect the g@@ ate@@ ful Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger le@@ op@@ ards of the Leop@@ ards , which are surrounded by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . there are a total of between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are at risk of prey , loss and frag@@ mentation of their living space .
why is this particular type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
like Raz@@ a in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large space is present .
the chance to see an Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually is small and goes on to zero . as the team in video therefore , she portra@@ ys that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as trained bi@@ olog@@ in shows Raz@@ a passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field trials in wild animals and education for six years .
it has been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 , and sets out that protection zones for wild animals are set up in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , which had been adv@@ anta@@ geous for the North @-@ East Japan , were to re@@ build the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami , and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , that is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an ec@@ tionary pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring capital of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ish all coastal cities from the map .
the pre@@ fecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident , just around 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
housing in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( the o@@ il@@ j@@ es@@ o@@ il@@ j@@ es@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fukushima joined the final light against Fukushima .
it is still trying to settle for six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ qu@@ eries , which re@@ acted in final spare homes for six years .
according to the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation .
almost 40 percent of Fukushima was evacu@@ ated from Fukushima in 2011 , while working in not@@ ices , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had more successful . more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster in containers were moved into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
status of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the disaster until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now operational , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries have recovered their operations in Fukushima .
ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian agricultural land has withdrawn .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i restored 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fukushima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fukushima , are located in the nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has again recovered again , but also the Fukushima remained un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are 90 percent of the same stand as before the disaster . Fukushima , however , can only be 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe , almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacu@@ ated through . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and also , how their recommendation is changing compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among local population in experience .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local inhabitants have taken the measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respondents say that there was still not enough in cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ es prevention .
how about those who are evacu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fukushima .
Fukushima did not only experience the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear disorder , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fukushima , nearly 63 000 people were placed in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fukushima , in permanent spare parts .
according to the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live outside the Fukushima pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated , which are still more than 50 years old . they have to go back in proper accommodation , because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects . this is about construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
however , after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that more than it appears to be at first glance .
these global links are important because they want to challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and recall us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat themes that often get less attention when they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember to a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over the language and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i says about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love for music has worked in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the period where they worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activist in artificial coma , after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations ,
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with approval .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had defeated him against the head in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors oper@@ able him on this Saturday and put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil for a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officers to recognize , identified with a impact attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ a@@ io .
after the incident was announced by the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ a@@ io had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , where you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several San@@ itary shortly to him .
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
in the clip below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while staying at the hospital .
&quot; be bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing was divided several times in social networks .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publication with approval .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish of his father was murdered , because he was sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked by a police station after being attacked by a polic@@ emen who had been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a impact on his face .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen trained at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
member of the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests , by introducing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : one window board .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted about a white glass window to illustr@@ ate their cover pages illustr@@ ative .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set on fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special thing .
this one has to recognize , if one is stri@@ cken against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives an absurd importance , and the typical actions of the military police are disp@@ osed of head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the un@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization of the villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories included the doors in Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the People &apos;s Par@@ ish Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there is no significant sugar be@@ ating from the town .
it is two years ago when the activities were settled in the sugar cane factories .
after the hanging , the sugar cane industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the s@@ caff@@ old was left of steel and concrete .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and moving daily on the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a solo record that rises at 4 : 00 every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not handle his sleep .
he heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which have been in operation after a long time , because they were preserved .
that was something that he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already the pl@@ agues , the fall of Soci@@ alism , the low market prices , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a curios@@ ity .
why was the Cuban sugar imports switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the com@@ min@@ ution of the sugar cane industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they were in@@ separable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the mot@@ i@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound according to the 2016 report &quot; Land@@ wirtschaft@@ spek@@ tiven &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and N@@ utr@@ itional Health Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the Su@@ ro@@ hr@@ factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he is repeated most , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all respondents agree , not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full time - working group .
in front of the first night seasons , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents to be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could be appro@@ ve .
from there , responsibility and letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ up factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part , which he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industry area of Cuba and the most important work producers were deleted .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present people saw that he was guaranteed for the oppos@@ e whose factories have not been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by M@@ ole .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the People &apos;s Par@@ ish Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar be@@ et factory closed , or better said when they began to cancel them , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ted to asp@@ hal@@ ted the street , and also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve once for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continues to be impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ und@@ und@@ forty gave the old soldiers a lot of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years at retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ verse person , yet he gi@@ veth the lies , which one told him , not .
they have been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing on power , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations young@@ sters use hip @-@ Hop to express itself and get their own culture
inclusion of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they can do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour since 2014 , workshops will bring mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec , with ten Cre@@ e communities , and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop thus increases the young participants in our conversations such as &quot; cultural identity , &quot; language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever you can find in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young@@ sters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o , in the area of the tribe of Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First nation in British Columbia , is telling the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video game to con@@ vey how important is the most of the traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters don &apos;t always have to rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation recorded , the re@@ frac@@ ture is sung in Cre@@ e .
the youth participated in a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ Hop group who gave them a drop in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel when nobody cares for me
but I continue to go on Earth for my days on the earth
that is the day when you receive our cry ,
because we lost our way to life in life
but I believe that we will be able to raise us one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
thus they can grow and forward to our youth
thus , they can do what it determined to the Creator
in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also creates a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ign ( which is also published on his blog and will be published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan , one can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show the potential customers what exactly are available on the menu , are attached to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of each food that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the C@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a wide variety of these small businesses that perform those plastic dishes , who documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually found that they don &apos;t even listen to them all . a new trend is transformed into current mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media reviews and photos that show this unusual Twist with the sho@@ ok san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic @-@ made decorative tapes , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ oned collection , as in this case , cool@@ box , mag@@ nets :
here are a few shot refriger@@ ated mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the essenti@@ als is increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also have made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing pl@@ ough to the coming .
some mobile support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon are che@@ ated , a popular T@@ opping , that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise .

&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of in- and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffic@@ king &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ xes and mo@@ ckers regularly immer@@ sed in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that brings together this battle .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or to the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind each bone , behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ tender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traffic@@ king , &quot; ) , &quot; that these victims should give a voice and stories of people who were fighting for the fight between criminal law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the effects are much pro@@ found .
for example , if shops include because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to travel many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( german : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that seeks every weekend secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who , on only one day their father , lost their four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
priest : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today again to the task that we have given us to get rid of and to the graves , to the people whom we loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th , he would be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship .
my mother , which is here with me , is also my mother .
at the moment , it has no income .
you stand the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out , because they ask a death certificate .
where should we get ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must not only show the faces of those who imagine the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state of govern@@ ance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been aware of the disease and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I &apos;m getting over every day in newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title page with pictures that can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling , as if I am the only one who am pressed , or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to the body .
I can &apos;t be valid either , or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) , if it is great . and it is not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me , it is , when they de@@ fied those who have lost someone who have lost someone , and those who fear them so something happens .
I see our weakness when stories are to blo@@ gging numbers in a statistic .
the crime of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; refu@@ elling . &quot;
I think they are trying to talk about such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t stir and still are silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of print in the main city District . &quot; this describes her , as armed crime month for month money from their business until they did not only destroy the business , but also their family apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again , when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are apart from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these terrible days , I asked if weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , for I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the post &quot; The forgotten children by Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of Israel @-@ called Generation . &quot;
in the introduction he th@@ rows questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the dangerous city of Mexican ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for her .
Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and He told that he had to teach himself how to make an egg , boiled potatoes , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left hand - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with them .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was already over two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody dead of his father , who was shot by armed men from a sitting car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence contributed by the organised crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of victims of civil security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the public prosecutor &apos;s office is 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul .
few stories are still living in the face of a new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ us@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; the journ@@ alism project has called Nar@@ co data into life , whose aim is to set the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffic@@ king , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in understand@@ able manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he exp@@ ire , contain pictures , on which violence is shown .
the fact check is important in one moment in which it comes to lifting a rum@@ or , or to un@@ mask counter@@ feit .
but how is the year after being immer@@ sed for the first time ? content in social media , whether it &apos;s true or true , tend to exist .
take this photo of a terrible disorder seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been used to use ir@@ radiation , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false Cou@@ pling of Image and Event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - Do not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , it th@@ rows questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker wag@@ ons the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neg@@ lec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with impact holes , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank wagon fell victim to a victim .
government representatives describes a fire @-@ ball , covered houses , including a cinemas in the vicinity , that was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football World Cup .
houses waste and c@@ anned bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ mist@@ ak@@ iness .
a picture of the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the lecture forms the grey scenes of this day .
at the top is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body , which are excited on the floor while people watch it .
but here is the story not their end .
over the years the same photo was f@@ ished for several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , however , real but not to be attributed to the related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am took part in Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and burnt down in streets and bones .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures couldn &apos;t be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were crushed , shot or burned .
only using satellite images the following time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army service point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the image from the DR Congo appeared again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failure rates ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of massage .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example acci@@ dentally the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a lighten@@ ing message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee sli@@ cks , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts told how the following descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from a Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to describe this information .
the original entry , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , the AFP as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ an Being this statement , but had not been associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the global range of false information
traces of these wrong coupling ranges from 2011 to 2012 and actually come back from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; returned picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a re @-@ returned picture search with the Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they originate from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , others have tried to un@@ mask the maturity .
we have examples of mis@@ use use , and they have been associated with the respective countries , based on what page they have been published . therefore , we want to represent the range more clearly than the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ used use may come from the bottom listed countries ( which are linked together in some cases ) .
here are some cases which can now be rented completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of wrong head sets out of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ anges countries refer to pages or servers , about the examples of counter@@ feit or fal@@ se@@ hood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only accept the counter@@ feit , but also discussed the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in the context of Nigeria as well as further questions about the int@@ entions of persons and the tra@@ ded trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ublic@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( which is not known if the original report has the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this , the image from the DR Congo used to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; have clearly seen some pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who resi@@ des this .

Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency Nas@@ im and used to illustr@@ ative the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Congo was a proof of the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for a mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , with one part , the symp@@ athy toward the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand a blo@@ g@@ gers , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , are pursued to del@@ ig@@ ate , as the photos have been ab@@ stain@@ ed .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar published a correc@@ tive news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Rich@@ tig@@ ress , which has been published exclusively in English , includes references to f@@ ake images of rum@@ or , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and may be used by extrem@@ ist groups to kill the Budd@@ hi@@ sts kill and elsewhere ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , presents clear that the picture of the DR Congo doesn &apos;t show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an being released in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time this publication is still included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now , published by the Catholic close of the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture was not taken by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it has a &quot; similar d@@ shift attack . &quot;
when the picture was later used in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there would be links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ thin y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and caused a discussion under Muslims after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the connections on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found this events that was alleged in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the image has been wit@@ ched as a proof for the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ed ) . but the messages that were associated with them were taken up in no religious context .
instead , the target was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; p@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in circulation , the discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the fal@@ se@@ hood .
from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ ressed .
there are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but they are not fully re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data transfer with UR@@ Ls and time / data est@@ amp exist on the web cra@@ wler and in connection they have image names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases that previously appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image could ultimately be a correct description , but the original entry is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that attract these podium . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in the context of Muslims by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is rated as compared to European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to investigate how images are used in the context of these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , if readers cannot give these pictures more faith .
with social media , there are nin@@ ety people who are un@@ intenti@@ onally threatened to exercise the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ger@@ ated this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are in@@ true and nar@@ row@@ ly the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the prolifer@@ ation of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated ( e.g. , for example ) .
an argument is that the re@@ tention of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures even demands even by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern , that for@@ ci@@ ble images and viewers are des@@ irable and to take the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which seek to work as non@@ violent media to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the media media , fact that they are indispensable for the present news release .
Techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will need to think about situation in which an image suggests something , but what actually is used from the context or completely ab@@ used type can be used .
any investigation , however , should also be considered as internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ ob@@ sol@@ vable ) is trying to provide a choice of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
these words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that often are very complex or specific .
some of these words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish brake ) .
but all resi@@ sts stub@@ born every attempt of an easy translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have already been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and L@@ ingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u system , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - En@@ try your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the convenience or sl@@ oth that you feel after being in the sun in cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they s@@ ander other cultures , reveal other ideas and wake up our curios@@ ity .
sometimes , as we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the L@@ ingu@@ ists on this page still want to show more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very much appreciated by non@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload your favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade goes
Sri Lanka &apos;s island is currently looking for the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ sun , which normally runs at the end of May , are caused by heavy rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts within the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud .
over 400 000 people have been affected last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe courts .
the rainfall left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water stocks in some places went slowly .
health and hygiene rates of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :

when I was approved in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and loving love .
I trusted her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for the rights of women .
in the next channels we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , other channels against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lima ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
people , with whom I &apos;m working or people who know me for years - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widely used concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; built up in their performance .
she ob@@ lige me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practic@@ ing our religion differently .
we identify with this to be Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we will put all into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims I do not fit there , un@@ mus@@ cular .
dis@@ mis@@ ed will be mis@@ ed
I don &apos;t get alone .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come in a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I &apos;m now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western performance , religion Rum@@ is was deleted as well as of the most popular translations of his poetry .
this li@@ ken@@ ess makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslim images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ized by Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man , which one should fear and the exotic woman who should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Sa@@ id destroyed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to rise today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to continue .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , fla@@ w@@ less nar@@ rative our news@@ feeds domin@@ ate .
this Nar@@ rative over@@ burden the reality that led to their countries in the last three decades of nine Muslim women , while the US could not once again choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are forced to carry their head@@ scarf and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this severe nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the African soil by Afri@@ cans , which had been brought to here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely occupies our collective pre@@ ference force of deep and in@@ correct that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are becoming the goal of anti @-@ oxid@@ ant attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way , in which we tell them , the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative who help us understand the world .
and my industry is fabulous to capture the Nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are failed , where seven million Muslims are in the highest grade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first gem design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ disputed Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ vent@@ ured for the climate and Americans ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I am not looking for pork , I say , instead of my Muslim recipes or bring my hand@@ ful hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that carry all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am scher@@ ze , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who ende@@ av@@ enge to fight far beyond the Islam .
these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated with monetary aggreg@@ ates , think tanks and experts for counter@@ feit information which has already been a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way , in which we tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that breaks down the head@@ scarf .

I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lima , but was born in my role force , when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they look back to the following terms : faith , behaviour , and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ors are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my love , my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , that I am Mus@@ lima , when it could look at the 15 meters of concrete and air that split our houses .
she would see the annual rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and her Arab verses become a protection for protection , who will defeat the Kor@@ an and the Q@@ uls .
every one of them repeat three times .
I pray you , that they may be protected from evil , evil , that can be seen and evil that can not see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

to be Mus@@ lima , to speak the prayers , which she said to me , If I have a bad day .
to be Mus@@ lima , as she has taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; Empire &quot; by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has formed a company with the name of hon@@ e@@ worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord .

affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart from colon@@ ists , who have shared Muslim world like at stake .
in the past two centuries , Mus@@ lima means to know that Europeans have colon@@ ized all four Muslim countries in the past two centuries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ship of history was dropped from a century over one Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ less under@@ tan the British Empire , was named as &quot; dangerous &quot; because he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plug@@ ged story .
it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military of the world , with troops , spread over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , in Iraq , to pursue mass destruction of mass destruction that were not exist@@ ent .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of war .
an American Muslim climate means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy is searching for the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported for four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al , with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X is an American hero .

the Nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reduced bi@@ dity . &quot;
to be a mother , to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ fully and privileged persons built on this bi@@ dity of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia exists in the Muslim register which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration agents who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders on people from just the countries which bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which takes about the Arabs and Muslims in Vis@@ i@@ ards .
they are the wars we lead and the bombs that we throw down on Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and because of them we don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically documented image and bes@@ ought them to assess groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 on the evolution of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to overthrow the Muslim or the other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we look back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ w@@ less and dangerous bil@@ ty prints , which we present in our news re@@ au@@ ctions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video gallery Secret Li@@ ves , an initiative , prolifer@@ ate Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

and this moment has consequences that go out over the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now also lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by creating the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years ago , it had not given them yet ; now they rule over great regions in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the history , which I was not aware of , when I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today to an ir@@ reversible mus@@ lima .
things I left here like a break of bread in my speech .
things could wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ actions that makes our human@@ kind , likes a story , where anyone is made to another &quot; others . &quot;

initiative for nar@@ row@@ ly wants to preserve urban language biodiversity
stor@@ y@@ story tell by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can it be possible to enter here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , the founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) is the number of stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported a short initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated Blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language diversity of big cities and to be worthy .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not to be handed over to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we are cities , accept@@ ing cities - safe spaces , in which people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to be considered .
while &quot; listening often this is linked to understand , &quot; these events instead can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller print their history first in their own language and transl@@ ates them to English .
even if the participants don &apos;t have a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and their representation is that the listen@@ er can be placed on it .
they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ tale nar@@ ration R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also the opportunity to explain the opportunity for their country typical customs of heritage .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel of the H@@ oses and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
after having explained the importance of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have heard it !
they were attentive ...
they were very with me !
to date , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities took place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can be contacted by T@@ LS in order to organize their own story .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States re@@ jection of state training
with the aim of a new testing of public debt of Puerto Rico , who took home to 72 million US dollars on April 3 , 2017 , taking several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ ío Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group of Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( the Front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ section of the new debts of the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os requires that the politicians , banks and government authorities , are responsible for the debt of their corruption .
we demand a financial examination and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation in favour of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the territory integrated in the United States - suff@@ ers from a heavy financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside are to be held without the participation and conviction of the citizen who will be rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally Palestinian WEB@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ LER Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his support and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference of the digital culture , which will be held in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a historian in France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ ühl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book spr@@ ints &apos; made books of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ den ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to be built as movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are , with which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on site to watch over the fog , who gives our news@@ feeds and make some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled by the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ pris@@ ons , in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that waited for his release and want him to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us can begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely extreme belie@@ fs ?
the W@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ LER , open source and digital activist , has been in jail since March 2012 in the Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility sent to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ le was based on a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented himself as the Insider of the Assad government and set them up by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place location and state remain still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge about the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Engine@@ er and currently negoti@@ ate the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes competed as the work which he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 around the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ point of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here melt gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architectural models with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything about it , this architecture that is not only em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this stress to the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and conservation has created a set of time that will be the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel has not yet able to finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel , taught me to emb@@ race them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought English to me , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read English well , to write and speak .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others taught English to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also taught other prisoners as they use computers , at least in theory that they actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten ) , a pro@@ vocation , which she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she whis@@ per@@ ed the lyrics , when she visited him , he translated them out of the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .

the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I think in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we emb@@ race us ,
that any of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the skir@@ t of the prison
and I go in every detail of your voice and words .
which I bear with my passion ,
if your eyes are farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and in your absence to cry and to smile .
I testify to myself , that I will return soon ...

Mozambique : sentenced due to corruption and dis@@ mis@@ ed post due to corruption
the Muslims re@@ acted to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state apparatus after the corruption was celebrated .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other accused .
the money was from public funds provided by Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza , between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good lead and immediately requested his re@@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which granted the request , there would be no obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to obtain his old post as the company had no discipl@@ in@@ itis after his detention .
but many inhabitants do not have the action good .
the Centre for Public Health ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution that establishes itself for public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision to set up the company :
imagine a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back in regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company should also have launched a discipl@@ in@@ ous procedure against the ref@@ uses .
however , the company was apparently apparent and caused no appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as opposed to the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be coun@@ sel@@ ors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and that half of them had ab@@ sent .
he could hold talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing .
but since it is in@@ competent , he has decided to integrate into the company which he helped harm damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is like to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ ted !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he in@@ crimin@@ ated him , I can &apos;t believe someone who rewards it in such a way that has already ins@@ ulted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the moral to return and serve the state * he had already serving a unique opportunity to serve the state but has only served itself on the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state when it was we@@ ary for an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible source of money and the state itself is we@@ ari@@ ed , the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing and finally condemned to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this guy was rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te is preferred to recall the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Mos@@ ambi@@ kan@@ ers not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp , cutting @-@ cutting and - as well as said - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he confirmed energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is to be able to sell his own individual interest , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a amb@@ iti@@ oned man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not apply from his amb@@ itions .
a ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also ab@@ out@@ dated :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today he set him the company , with which he was the promise of money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Swe@@ des who will be rep@@ lic@@ able to rep@@ lic@@ it during the day ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the r@@ amp@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and st@@ ems many users in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ical Word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ ach or Sp@@ ect@@ b@@ se .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took its posts from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to point to people ost@@ in@@ dic origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ectiv@@ ity . &quot;
Facebook is expressed by the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or for the o@@ dd@@ ling @-@ sol@@ o@@ dd@@ ling ( in bur@@ m@@ ical writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ language in Burma in the social network .
over the past few years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely valuable con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra Nation@@ alists as Hass@@ speak against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight them in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has a lot of sen@@ su@@ al content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word at itself will not call them automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts who have discussed the word of the word or have doubts about the use of his instructions .
in addition there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ky A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the various mean@@ ings of words by the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on spiritual way if she could wake her back pain , as he made his back pain by doing a voc@@ alist .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats is the opinion that she must decrease radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ st to spread out all posts that are suspected to spread in the suspected hour of rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it will filter the Word automatically .
the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on fac@@ tions .
what you should do instead is carefully analyse the post and check it by check out the post @-@ standing words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age switch ) .
the good thing is that this dirty nation@@ alists , which hate me , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its Nation@@ alism .
while the promotion has a strong signal to all , the hate language may distribute the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship of percussion often have a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , where users can simply start social networks just to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his poet , when he just wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and told me the li@@ ken , post and share of Content for 24 hours , says the Post Community &apos;s Facebook community not deci@@ ding . &quot;
Facebook has a number of people away from people who have no negative int@@ entions , or trying to show their opinions against the hate talk radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate language :
next without Hass@@ speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about it , why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more than the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet Community to ask advice :
Facebook likes a s@@ wollen intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
such words to cen@@ sored will only bring more hat@@ red within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned as words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; builder cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even as they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to just@@ ify themselves .
if it &apos;s just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks are automatic c@@ ens@@ orship for much sp@@ ells among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if your posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts that no hate language ab@@ stain@@ ed , but nevertheless removed :

the bur@@ me@@ tic text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the cur@@ ry cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook contains the Post , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , you heal humans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , using permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , which have used social networks , has increased their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ ler should also be in charge of violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been awarded for his promise to crit@@ ici@@ zed out Hass@@ elt on his bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
but rather than just use the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better running on context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to provide a law which is to provide this practice , so that the married @-@ capable age is at 18 .
prior to this change of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es , some members of Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , gathered that the State should not be mixed because that , at the age , not the maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN child &apos;s rights Convention , the min@@ ors of children under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical agency confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that stri@@ ves to abol@@ ish laws for pedi@@ gre@@ es , followed at the foot and became great support . undoubtedly , they helped us to mediate this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
an Hin@@ du @-@ guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s children , they should be dam@@ ned to care about their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition ten@@ sions to tension in this actually in@@ complicated matter , and sometime were doubts that the opposition would agree at all .
however , in early 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s children - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that was discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country has to vote and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update which has again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s accession was in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
after having decided before the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws have been last modified .
Facebook @-@ member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a prime minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary sound needed , which has caused the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely going long enough to finish the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent News !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who listened to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society which said quite openly about how important is the adoption of the law , noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the design for the amendment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 MPs and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all MPs , who were contrary to the law , voted for the law .
children &apos;s before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ able child@@ birth .
many thanks to all the activists who have laid him out .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
thanks to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , a secretary general of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to do judicial steps , the law should be approved , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , meant that Mahar@@ aj would like to go against the law , most social media users would wish to be held the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
Dear Sat , if we can , instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that we invite you to accept the state into our bedroom , that the state , our daughters , protects them from large , hard @-@ minded men who are ab@@ used against them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a judicial approach to the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations or remains the norm , although there is laws , which they under@@ say .

by mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English language Wikipedia page was presented to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright Act in the United States , internationally un@@ ob@@ sc@@ ated by the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series turns against the sperm .
although many techniques are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article published by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world ) , most of the ordinary Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall into this category .
although Turkey has been locked in an article by Wikipedia , as recently published in an published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Act was adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often are updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan File System ) , when the platform shut down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( thus calcul@@ ator machine connections ) , which is based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite the ban .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( via the sperm on Wikipedia ) , we put everything about snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the opportunity to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ y.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ kno@@ ck , a Mir@@ ror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to ho@@ wling similar to Mir@@ ror pages if Wikipedia is imprisoned in the respective Land of Wikipedia .
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open speaks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you attack another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
basically , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even when these are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server , which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ es@@ ischer Wild@@ life photographer uses his camera to give attention to the need for nature conservation
a working rhin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

using permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ derly mot@@ i@@ fs and balanced colors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this motivated him to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ al@@ ese lives to the international stage .
and its native place right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention on Nep@@ al@@ ese world .
he described on Facebook as this first @-@ class location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested just at home when I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan Ga@@ ida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River is a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to cra@@ ck pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to achieve a cooperation with the authorities to at@@ tain global recognition for Nep@@ als nature and want to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
and he should know it , because he rose from face to face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b with the opinion of the sheep at bed@@ time ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I also was because of darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sets us , and he star@@ red me through the Sal of Sal ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and Wild@@ life is not always simple .
he was waiting for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent that lasted up to 12 days , until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist destination .
see below some of these photos .

years after the marriage , Indian women are for the first time to talk the names of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released here as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India there is women with the greatest care to talk the names of their hus@@ bands or even from older men in the family .
instead , they use a p@@ onom@@ ic or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ ann@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should be mis@@ erable , this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian state O@@ gli@@ a by a head@@ court and away from her family and the village of the village , after they had addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition of wives also did not call on behalf , is also common among men . however , they are far from less conc@@ ei@@ vable , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus fast to the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
when one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets itself for mining the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made the amb@@ ass@@ adors of the mur@@ als at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion group showed women who did not call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
it was chosen for this issue because she wanted to open the talk about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to talk the names of their hus@@ bands , it is a brilli@@ ance charged , which they have not guilty to all obligations and have never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testified that a woman resp@@ ects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t keep it , is considered a back@@ rest , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition has so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made ourselves up to this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband before the name , wanted to try out at home , as it works .
she showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in mother .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother in law and my husband weigh still long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned back to me , and said , I should call him by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage started Roh@@ ini started its first discussion lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected from all girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the names of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which he married women to the names of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise only got k@@ ich@@ ed ; another decided to leave the entire en@@ chan@@ ted fru@@ strations for him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ exchange , with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually try to be at home to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a wide range of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas put her in his head : his wife did not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner prior to the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in mother murdered her , she got anxiety and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practition@@ ers , such as carrying the jo@@ vial red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red point when he would also open it .
he just laugh@@ ed and I heard him to carry him .
the other women stopped not completely , but my , they are now in a better position to choose even to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion lu@@ b is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip at every discussion group .
normally we pack lunch and water , go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cake ; they d@@ anced and sang , and talked about things about which they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have worked on some things , for example , like our ident@@ ities to our hus@@ bands , never been so honest .
it feels great , certain things to say no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we have maintained the concept of honor and as it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted to bear a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a tro@@ users ; they have not dar@@ nel .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the pre@@ ferences of their own coat @-@ election , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , pretty rough Roh@@ ini ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round that women could bear them .
next , they now decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a while they can carry out Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will be able to make it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that the things are slowly coming to the rolls :
we have done so far small steps .
some women tried a few times , but then heard it back to say the name of her husband .
some , inside me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two say still the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion lu@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ eil@@ ing for more freedom of movement or their own closet - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by turning itself mut@@ ually self @-@ confidence , they will deliber@@ ate that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club , each of us , gives us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if any woman comes home with the club and tell others of it what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

on the 29th of June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the o@@ dd@@ ling of the last @-@ o@@ dd@@ ess of the Japanese Twitter trend , with many fans of memories and their appreciation to the Beatles played .
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a sol@@ st@@ ice in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who were interviewed in London in 1964 , noted on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for almost five days the Beatles were in the country , but this has enough to rotate the Japanese .
people here soon became clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles have been received with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith , when the Beatles came to Japan in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail trade show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! the day is the Beatles Day in Japan . during the last 51 years they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs were sung by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English lessons at Japanese secondary schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today the Beatles Memorial Day .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should represent or not .
and how it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
7 . if you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages sometimes cannot be r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today the Beatles Memorial Day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beatles came to Japan .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies are using the fan base as well as for example this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the day is the Beatles Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day today will run .
so , we hope you are there !

gl@@ ass@@ le of men will dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique

a new system of de@@ duction of gl@@ ass@@ orted individuals for organ trade , presumably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , dis@@ close the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations in life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and in the sequence they conf@@ essed that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there was a local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a gl@@ ass@@ eur man &apos;s gold be@@ fell or wealth , the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ ers of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ ass@@ le men were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is purpose of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission to investigate this practice in the South African country in 2016 .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government campaigns to combat these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who prefer to travel to the country :
attention at k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of rit@@ ual attacks , war@@ n the Muslim police after the newest participation of three gl@@ ass@@ orted men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ urban in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already returned to the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are wrapped in the deaths of gl@@ ass@@ orted men .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ ass@@ orted individuals for the extraction and sale of their bodies in Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a province , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als , has been given by the traditional Sh@@ aman in the province of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also claims that a belief that existed in the mind , according to whom the victims in the head might have power , the wealth of gener@@ ers .
during the last days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ g@@ gers of the blo@@ g@@ gers of Sna@@ i@@ ppa , that is obvious that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , Mozambique is opposite :
I would like to pursue GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ICH , when the teachers would be ashamed to provide sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which the people would not hurt , or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; would be ch@@ ased out that aim to get rid of their wealth .
in spite of the appointment of the phenomena , some have the opportunity to avoid irrit@@ ating humor .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of prison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved attention to international community since his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state @-@ dangerous ) , after having calls on the draft of the Charter 08 , a Manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rator , he considered it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet China will continue to receive views from the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him to allow a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , different are completely out of the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to enable Li@@ u abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into the store after the Nobel Peace Prize was granted to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government had over@@ hur@@ ried that this ultimately had nothing to do with decision .
diplomatic relations continued only in December last year . in June , Norway was signed an agreement to return to China , since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the message that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his price in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to increase his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately to liber@@ ate under house arrest and to him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini also called for China to release Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted in a statement on June 30 , 2013 :
at the same time , we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they shall all meet and receive all visits , which they desire , and be able to communicate free with the outside world .
USA
U.S. Ambassador of Terry Bran@@ stad told us that Americans wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in@@ so far as to help him in his gen@@ esis . &quot;
a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message must not allow the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the petition of U.S. Embassy withdrew from China to a ra@@ ging response from China , with the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to unite himself and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Poland shared that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , such as travel agent and access to the medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Senate Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to push for the Chinese government , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I request China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can take a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; all the medical support is that he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the News Agency Reuters , that China had great concerns , whether the vort@@ ex could over@@ take a visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um , called for China to provide appropriate medical care to provide and give it the opportunity to provide himself from his family .
Li@@ us Bar told Him that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone out , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls on China to adopt its international rights issues , including freedom of expression , true , and for the exercise of these rights in@@ locked .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he is , ir@@ respective where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family will have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , there was no further information that France will eventually take it up .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of solids in Taiwan called for China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and require a greater tolerance to those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in China , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u urged China to allow China to be able to treat ill intellec@@ tuals Li@@ u to treat itself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u very wor@@ ried and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been punished , had led to a harmon@@ ious , more stable and weal@@ thy whose China had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and law of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this statement triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the meeting of the International branch of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
it support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked in question whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , whereby most people go to a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , according to all our efforts and offered to create this valuable country , we hear that we eventually have no country .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the state of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory infr@@ in@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons conducted by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , it was inev@@ it@@ ably democratic .
however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are led permanently from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re from the author@@ itarian Mach@@ ines emerg@@ es , the advance of democr@@ ats , leaving logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the final aspect , the answers of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers .
related questions tar@@ ts with non @-@ answers to r@@ ational art .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short , I don &apos;t understand .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our valued K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was to clari@@ fy this point , if he was paid highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the full address of the conference to better understand the context of statements from Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the heading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ even better if we are looking forward to free and appropriate elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no land , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t know it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a modern generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes this is correct and is aware of what he defended .
the T@@ EM@@ AS@@ EK Review sets the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
does Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam has committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der Speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role in the governmental institution , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious significance .
why are the Singap@@ ore@@ an of their military service , but they only defend their own country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the affir@@ mation of Singapore is always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems many Singap@@ ore@@ an to have off@@ ended ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for short his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect at your residence or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ever since in which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite , interest in his talk partner by asking personal questions .
then , in my clari@@ fication , the default response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans are perhaps boil within anger when they are kept for Americans , but did not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes the Canadian of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack , if they are travelling .
they all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans are ... .
so it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried a little map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also is considered the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends which I really ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would make me nothing if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called , is basically to be busy - as the goo@@ d@@ iness , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders out of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem exists , that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there is no corners and edges , nothing at which one can encounter .
harm@@ less , means in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this can be something good if one wants to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far from things that pass around .
I even would go far as far as to say that the desire , free and solely to be , a main partner of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what more extra@@ ordin@@ ated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often speak about the fence with the neighbours .
we are missing hot warm , open kindness , which I connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au came the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has been almost sexy .
musical video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert to Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band released a music video which took over the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert which took power in 2014 , despite its promises to restore the civil government to continue the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which the rules of him makes his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not explicitly politically , the music video is based on the continued military domin@@ ation of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook has been viewed 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists present the public to watch this video .
the video you can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special about how it keeps the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta @-@ rule .

the post@@ war company recovered only very slowly in East Asian @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian War was officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still strong in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , shooting Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked for Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russia and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
these settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks from the Soviet Union from the early 60s , the ch@@ u@@ ch@@ u@@ ch@@ kov@@ y@@ kas are symbol@@ ised , symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rare , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable maj@@ esty buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which can accommodate one or two families , one recogni@@ zes the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look at the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera , they immediately withdraw back immediately .
&quot; our mother is forbidden to let us photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just banned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her gir@@ l@@ friend , and suddenly leaving them destroyed the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of land@@ fill products ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to come over the rounds .
in winter , the District Administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved to Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to An@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of their oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial assistance from their daughter and insi@@ sted that they are supported their young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is too hard to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls aun@@ t G@@ alya her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .

&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as a meeting parties in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds about the village of Dor@@ mit@@ es .
in spite of the relatives who live in Central Ukraine , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we don &apos;t have fear of the dark street or a few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
actually , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there were hardly any work , and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember the city and the war once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses refugees on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org , published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a cor@@ p@@ rosa frame and gold colored bone earrings in ted@@ dy bears form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance hall there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of afri@@ can and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people to call the people in full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside boxes .
they don &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , she buys them drugs that could not pay them , she massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ st@@ ive from the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in front of a short time .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) po@@ unded with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel really that it fits on her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are in the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other sign@@ posts by Mama Africa . &quot; mo@@ m Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner often travel together the route and that Afri@@ kaner is already talking to What@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his position , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
since months he has been guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez told that her guests will often send text messages when they went to gr@@ ate them to tell her about the course of their journey .
they declared that her Christian faith is the drive of its work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the town a S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family met migrants in their small house .
it is Po@@ lic@@ ist and has found that the buff@@ ets are sold to numerous African migrants .
he began to help them a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep in ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they &apos;re experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was instructed in a raid on his labour place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to make money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , an all @-@ stone , has offered him roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and it tries to decide where the next steps shall go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the courses we consult the trav@@ eler quietly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full , but she is nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ mother they p@@ onder@@ ed in her album with many photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ id , who made her a Kund@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and elderly .
she laugh@@ ed , while she imag@@ ined it short .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeated every time every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users of the sol@@ o@@ und@@ ary frost
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware to their cell phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification where it refers to the regional government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Not@@ ification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not@@ ification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; provides access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities have also used the app for more than com@@ bating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app that they had installed the app with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app must determine the sources and the distribution ways of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make user attention online , how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in a different way .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ cements from digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet servers .
this is based on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( mo@@ an ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen were in@@ discri@@ min@@ ately installed if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you find an check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they are forced to use the people who are intended for elderly people to use .
this is a form of captivity by rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the characteristics of a Windows operating system , allowing them to un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones are in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council , minim@@ ize the dissem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government buildings , authorities and with the party linked institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned this new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , an order to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible violation , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; where the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane uses his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and show that you are all alone on a place where all the Import@@ ant disappeared .
everything was dissolved after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and a truth reveals that clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one that makes its name all glory .
one who feel in a list of feelings and express , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors to allow .
but when you get the reality again and you looked behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the actors - transform the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts lo@@ osen up in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is tra@@ pped on the axis of the disorder . it is clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone was erected around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough , so I was &quot; my lesson &quot; as the chief of the security services - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power over us in proof by he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers have been torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests like im@@ pregn@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time , it was still to reg@@ ain , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands to a city that has to be added to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ces .
during the third night , things had a calm , after the power supply in the quarter had to work .
I crossed the silence by playing several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice to resist the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends included me , we al@@ lied to a glorious picture that fulfilled my expectations full and fully fulfilled .
in such a moment , you know that you freed the Spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in at least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return to your voice after you have led them all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I also now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me hear , as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only bra@@ ve enough , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes were lifted up against me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are afraid to look at me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps at the Revolution .
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I haven &apos;t thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped to watch you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ed him with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father right with it . &quot;
the ste@@ ank of this cursed , is still in the nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a second torture that I was exposed to many months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am scre@@ ed to the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
afterwards again by the farm and into the second office which leads through a course to the individual cells .
I prepared for all details exactly one before I take the room .
unlike otherwise , they probably got a larger cell to me .
I have to share them with only one another prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , the civil servants felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I handle an old communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I knew that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; awakening @-@ ling . &quot;
after a long time he responded to me .
apparently there was none of the surrounding cells in any of the surrounding cells , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no striking fac@@ tions on me , and there is no doctors here ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is like my sound ? &quot;
all answers inter@@ connected its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the major cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would fre@@ er him when I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ s in the fruit in the garden of my head lab@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from afar , I hear still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always in order to kill the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the colour of the corrup@@ ter until I saw the yellow light that the horror is in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; playing on the 13th sh@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
this was the secret to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ian dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ ti@@ bility map and dis@@ close the close eye view of its world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ exist@@ ence to transform the crimin@@ als of its cl@@ ans into a mighty man .
I cared for the hearing space and meet you on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and st@@ oned man ; at least he comes before me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expressions that can un@@ cover him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my young , you are still young , you can do so much more important with your life than to protest this Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ vines and protest on demonstrations that will soon be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t say more precisely when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly interview made me become an ordinary communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to hurt me , though I had done nothing , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
at punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to ri@@ p me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker thinks in your cry .
give him a pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can not return your cry .
my cry were not enough for him , so why they cast the pipe through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked me if the investig@@ ator had been working as a gar@@ bage dump , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in one another to present us from their perspective , great invention of a giant cable .
within one hour , three of them changed from them while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and even my voice , why I heard to cry out .
the hen knew the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , making it the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through all your body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ body body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect head of power .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was again .
after two dre@@ ad@@ ful hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
some hours forg@@ ett@@ ingen , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to the Morgen@@ ge@@ bet .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhau@@ st@@ ive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father doesn &apos;t need to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be transferred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings the majority of its time inside ; sometimes he s@@ acked to his canvas , sometimes on his computer , and again on his couch .
but if you can rely on , there is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nic@@ ot@@ in spotted lips .
he lives in the top of his family house which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
since the past six years , H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist , which the conservative majority was transferred to the well @-@ proven opinion about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression through art and rap@@ ing .
with his music , which often disp@@ oss@@ essed with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry . all these topics can not only be found in its home town of Amman , but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria by far to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits , and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he doesn &apos;t open it , he swe@@ eps against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his fellow feeling for those who are trying to do in war zones , some of what to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian ge@@ aring of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and never existed in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; emphas@@ ises h@@ da@@ ib . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a person &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while staying in water dissolved N@@ es@@ cafe in two cups , it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; this time it is intended for Muslims to fast sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
apparently , H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weak@@ nesses to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sel@@ ess Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
in general , the sl@@ ump of hot coffee and ch@@ wa@@ der of K@@ ent cigarette can be found in the nose primarily by freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free heaven , especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore we avo@@ ids things to do basic things - as to the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to not land in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary directors that support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ted the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert is said .
the MPs and former pressing of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers .
many claim to say the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free opinion of expression in the Arab world is dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that in@@ quire the approved legitim@@ acy regime in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a reported the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to be decided &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact clearly reflected the cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib became traditional gender standards by which he formed his vision by the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of an evi@@ dently , unknown woman , whose arms and legs reach up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of in@@ numer@@ able women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should actually trust .
over the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ ored &apos; in Jordan has increased - the in@@ official outside left .
human Rights Watch , according to the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 , reached its cul@@ mination in 2016 . however , Jordan was still ongoing that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure for women who tried to support victims of murder or domestic violence to the appropriate type .
according to a law on the un@@ break@@ able control from 1954 , women who are subjected to danger of a family authority , &quot; and for their release is often a lon@@ anger bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will happen nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , even not shy of the subject in his country as tab@@ u .
h@@ da@@ ib , however , is that his work is politically , however , is a dream that he can separate his music that is full of explic@@ it announ@@ cements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , a man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he was conf@@ is@@ oned to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity of the attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , which one wants , &quot; be faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that there is hardly any one in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were heavily damaged in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn in the context , twi@@ sted and had been cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ ib ac@@ quires open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree to Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in remembrance today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib wonders : if Abu Nu@@ ern@@ ing , who was to work in the eighth century on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled to do .
in the hec@@ tic kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian News Service adopted several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the grounds that they would have been critical to the issues related to the issues related to the problems with the deep in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is , according to that , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is an independent g@@ ent and take off . Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks like H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , thought and in@@ definite changes . it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions of abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of being able to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region will help with music , art and literature of real and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess , and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ ing and on artificial kind . at least , he hopes it .
as far as far as it is far , H@@ da@@ ib will continue to carry further resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man stops as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these large , ex@@ travag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is also celebrated in many regions in August . another theory states that the Fest@@ ams , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years , have been invaded by the west of Japan in the North East to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a couple of great places , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a shared center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I &apos;ve been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and another great way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they are helping to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and maintain a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where road smoking and illegal drug retailers are everyday .
a survey in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other central and South American countries - rising demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led that more and more normal citizens to the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers can be found .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , taking part of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts ass@@ orted each other to show who can be seen from them the ex@@ cent@@ est L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions ) on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the School August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to replace their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ ser tools and receive an apprenticeship in hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ et@@ ating possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school was offered special educational workshops before the beginning of March , and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : lov@@ em@@ rie@@ fe at gu@@ err@@ illa ste@@ amer

use with friendly auth@@ orization .
the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa ste@@ amer , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel well @-@ cast , aff@@ ection@@ ate aff@@ ection ?
just this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , young people are encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian Government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the sign@@ atories of the Nobel Peace Treaty as important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bian is a long way , until one can talk of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa ste@@ amer , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war of war and around the clock their weapons had to be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , again , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , had to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to their rows and support them in their rows and support them in construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colombia must join themselves and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : until now thousands young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in society .
the campaign of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ als , which should be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was originated on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people whom we love to write thousands of love letters in Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who don &apos;t need to need to need .
he plan , he told you to share his love with people this year , who needed to the most urgent inquiries .
so , the plan was to write letters with hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to build up their place in society . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make a dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in the camp to over@@ take the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC are based on how they did earlier in order to oppos@@ e the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of under@@ taking people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can pass through only a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything that is in between , &quot; told the political science student Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having given the letters , a former fighter brought me through the camp of gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illas live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa ste@@ amer , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because in addition to him on the bed a m@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in a th@@ orn sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
never in my life someone has written something so nice , therefore I reply to it . I suddenly ran the tears about the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful endang@@ ering this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company that awaits us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how I have to handle with weapons .
but now there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC arrived in a discussion round .
students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
for a target of this size , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people hear , which have never seen hearing , and had no electoral law , and that the people who often have seen as a monster , and even hate them that were surrounded by their vit@@ ality and the environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the land lives , will hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - also those who have killed and done so much harm to us and give us a smile and a hug .
many former milit@@ ants have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian has been prophes@@ ying that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation would rule peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons and to protest against their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology will listen to them - to spread over all those who dreams of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know of your own experience that nothing is simple . that among us who defend lives as the basis of existence , many difficulties are imp@@ ending .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ woman speaks about the persecu@@ tions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

the translation of an article published by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ o@@ wa was written and its first published on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osexual and qu@@ eer people living in the Caucas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with horror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months about the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the dor@@ sal of LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only formed by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman of Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what is currently in the republic .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q &apos;s legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after reports were published , which was the to@@ wing , torture and murder of que@@ ens men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta . she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ icious que@@ ens and in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
from fear of her life she moved to the United States last year .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that anyone needed my help .
this was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who raised in difficulties .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , photos of my documents made by very What@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was straight to draw a few shopping bags from the back seat of my cars , I heard a man@@ oeu@@ vre : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned , I felt something in my body , but didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen , &quot; How long will you still honour the family ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke the final end of the hospital in the hospital .
apparently some women had taken everything together and began to cry .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had taken two j@@ igsaw in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since my male name stands on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful for him to be resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
I was thre@@ ats to thre@@ ats last February .
they call me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the requested , sent me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they created absurd demands : some said me , I have to prove it by the streets running . others wanted me to tell my gender that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have gra@@ ven @-@ size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much , and she put a Stri@@ ck around the neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change several times a day .
I moved into a flat and just a few hours later , under the window , a car with dar@@ kened window disc and a number@@ ing plate with a top 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it was clear that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the number@@ ing signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I want not to give their names , but I want to say that I remember it all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can still understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without sign up , without notice , without notice .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered at a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you warm@@ est in safety , just because you have left the country ?
our people know , in which hotel you are using . you even know your room number .
only to prove you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was really my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about sexual intercourse , however , this is a tobacco topic .
I still carry some traditional cant@@ onal elements in me .
as much as I wish it , this se@@ atic bar@@ riers can &apos;t be overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I give me really effort to look like the person they look back from their past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ ality ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an , he was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relative to the problem with the concerned person and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still pregnant women detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me , there &apos;s just not many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were left out of their relatives to put Kad@@ y@@ rows in judgment .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so you can present them as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked your village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as though , these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radic@@ alize himself .
OC Media : is that only a guess or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just wanted someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have van@@ ished in this prison after her be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was taken away as these people were taken away .
until now , however , they were not presented as a band@@ its , yet there were no reports so far . we dis@@ cour@@ aged that these actions are quite possible .
why would it not allowed to shave this man to shaving ?
do you know if these persecu@@ tions and screen@@ ings of people who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , which took place in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 , I was already known in the Great Britain , when I still lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally we had thrown back into the st@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : what is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhau@@ sted , I had colored eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the security Ministry of the Sh@@ aria never has a hair cooled down .
before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people arrived there .
we have never ins@@ ulted .
there is a speech in the Che@@ chen language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children when they are talking about sick .
OC Media : so they simply have her eyes closed before you , because they believed that you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never ch@@ ased and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did these gifts be ?
Sabrina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about moral over mor@@ als .
he did not talk about us per se , but rather above the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city began to change .
whoever borro@@ wed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I was able to feel the situation in the republic .
OC Media : what activity do you go after ?
Sabrina : I am working as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
apart from this , I still worked as a activist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ iz@@ ers with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ gers , I don@@ ite them to hospital and help them to get food types .
I p@@ liers no cents .
I discovered this people themselves when I climbed up .
I am Mus@@ lima and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ lied .
so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there is no cur@@ ls .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have those who have the Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who also have Russians also . on the whole planet , they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here as many men from Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims that go into the mosque and during Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ inity to men who love men , and they believe that one gets to his gender to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ cking connection .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sens@@ ations to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I become so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I know that I myself am now .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of suicide in the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months , there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with auth@@ orization .
the self @-@ burning of a man named Y@@ asser Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ahmed @-@ Community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child . he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , who can come to the imp@@ etus for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi Human Rights Groups , who would like to work and anonymous .
once a YouTube tuned video , the moments after he ign@@ ited himself , firm .
some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could not do any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ minority , and activists war@@ n before the spot that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ i Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged .
their stories have a thing together : they were all family fathers , who felt on persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families and go to a safe work .
Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where most of the Arab people living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population .
in a century ago , the Arab An@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and under@@ took major efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in the whole Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most sustainable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to remain slow , and the local population receives only little from that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and ab@@ dic@@ ations .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arab@@ ians in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ted .
this twi@@ me have only managed to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region , and to destroy local agriculture and fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arabian A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who have completed a work which finished primary school , with 55 % of a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist eth@@ ical discrimination , &quot; said to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young people .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has got worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic groups and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in setting process :
as officials and institutions does not plan to set Arab workers to have access to the local Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ zi access to all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make her living outside of their hometown Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their advantages and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi as even Arabic name at the workplace will not be toler@@ ated because the speaking of the Arabic language or carrying out Arabic clothes .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must be able to strike human rights activists before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , whether the world is being awake and knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and hom@@ icide avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why I &apos;m not identified with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional part &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the site of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions came out .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am no femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an internal femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even place scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all Fem@@ inist * inside .
for example , in spite of the same education women still earn less money than men .
that women still stand still under str@@ ingent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women grow earlier or later in various areas of life in a glorious ceiling , and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all this is aware and well known .
I am convinced and I suffer from double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I am speaking on skin colour , on black C@@ is women , on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a , if I mention that kind of femin@@ ist , spiritual and verb@@ al have been ab@@ used , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , made many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they are all interested in that women - all women - come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &apos; to sing equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexual violence , a institutional form of assi@@ mil@@ dly motiv@@ ating violence , which we have been exposed to black women in two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ity and Her@@ oes are less des@@ erve as white men and women .
that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant back@@ grounds are more frequently referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black sp@@ ears and women with migration background are subject to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one hand , I want to have all men , all males and all men , neither skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect to the white woman in whose center , the white woman , which ref@@ uses to consider both the gender as well as on the skin colour of a person .
I am exhau@@ sted and will no longer be strug@@ gling to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spy which me and countless other black women always turned down again .
in their speech in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner said in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a decent and mar@@ gin@@ alized being .
I refuse to connect me to group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to drive their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ centric program .
I &apos;m not trying to grow white women to be the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to dis@@ close the meaning of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to expos@@ e it to better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to settle women from different countries and to limit the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I draw it before me to get rid of me full and completely of femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as woman in life , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own shows and placed us in the sp@@ ouses , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) says that we can defend ourselves on our own way , and not only that - black women may be able to provide us in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed that make the black woman .
although some of the white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately claim that they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I &apos;ve existed in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized as part of this para@@ dig@@ m as part of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is not over@@ threw , nor ignored , nor denied .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the Mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reported in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Agreement , this article will be published here again .
in the past 7 years , Nabil Mus@@ a travelled again in the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in the can@@ oe - with a special attention through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to deliber@@ ate the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we lost , as I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust extrac@@ tors , the pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers in Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ borne Alliance - who is moving and works to protect the rivers , streams , and water paths in Iraq , as well as local municipalities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the pressures and importance of its work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;

Paragu@@ ay@@ ment Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to express their pain about the women &apos;s moral in the country and in the region , and show their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ n . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft female ) , which reports against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people affected .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship , the police have passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not do .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was found because of mis@@ use , the ak@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez couldn &apos;t be used .
a few days later , the second wife moved back its ad .
the devil &apos;s violence against women break is difficult .
if women make a display at all , they are generally no support from the State .
in many cases women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men who mis@@ use them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit victim to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution &apos;s tra@@ ce@@ ability .
content and Statistics 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sing and a legal system that nothing under@@ tak@@ er 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ ans : good approach , defective implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for comra@@ des on Centro de Document@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General of 9@@ 600 ads went on domestic violence . 70 % of them went by violence against women .
86 % of ads with the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against peace dishes . 86 % of the ads were born here .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
the statistics show however not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Ba@@ i@@ ar@@ di , only few of these offen@@ ders are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who will be refunded to Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be reim@@ bur@@ sed for physical failure , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay cannot be documented , the prosecution authorities may not document appropriate , as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days a woman died due to violence through men .

invisible Mis@@ sing and a legal system that nothing under@@ takes
before Mariana was the strong gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she under@@ took the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms :
I have never thought that I would have been victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment once .
when I read before that , I thought that the only women happen to fall into sub@@ jection because they dec@@ eive of violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever made the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mariana why they did so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments should have at least a certain fellow to blame .
Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o di Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments .
in the group they can talk to other information about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with mental failure .
her weal@@ thy partner was finally able to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victori@@ as Advert@@ is@@ ements for the authorities remained without the result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against their former partner who developed into an infinite legal struggle between Paraguay and her hometown , where it mainly went for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ ans : good approach , lacking implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied .
the ad of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments is a way of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees large problems in the use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ sie ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Una@@ men@@ os movement ( # non @-@ Wen@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supporting Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law fore@@ sees Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and harder to explain and tough@@ er as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to win even the dep@@ uties for the law , they were afraid that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions I become illegal in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cost most of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) procedure which must have the victims of violence at present themselves when they simply receive only display and secure a safe accommodation to state the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial means to this place :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships .
here , a change must take place , so violence is no longer considered to be Normal .
those who keep silence in the light of these facts makes himself guilty and wearing that the perpet@@ rators come from .
we have to leave so long display , until failure is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law was changed , however , among other things , a passage was cancelled , which called the partner in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions about changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggression , once again attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked in due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the Iranian authorities have closed an independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their coverage over corruption in the Sultan .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and released in court , but later returned .
Oman has been re@@ igns since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Sa@@ id who came to power after he had depos@@ ed his father , Sa@@ id i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur .

the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights systematically and citizens , also activists , and their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level Parties to the Justice &quot; hands on 26 July 2016 . in this case it went to corruption in the Ju@@ sti@@ ff@@ room and the mixture of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edition of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level political parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final shut@@ down of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to both other things because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; Under@@ standing of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a publication and de@@ fam@@ ation for de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of detention and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a single year of professional prohibition against the two journalists was hanged .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after being used the use of a source network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was fixed a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was fired on 10 April 2017 in the prison sentence of his six months prison sentence from the Central prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appeals Court also set up the decision of the Ministry of Finance to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees to be exposed by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister for Information was personally signed by an additional instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and in which the Minister presented another time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman have been viol@@ ated the press freedom .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine Mo@@ wat@@ in and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put into operation .
due to the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press freedom .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the following authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances that human rights of human rights and journalists in Oman have imp@@ eded their right human rights work , and without fear of temp@@ ting measures , including play@@ able ch@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is carried out with his permission
medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the required medical research on site . there are two reasons for a demand in the supply of global healthcare industry , many medicines and vaccines required to cover the special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have more serious impact in the poo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments in the research of these diseases through pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves being carried out in building their own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for exploring infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first gra@@ zing effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later on Indiana .
as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he explored himself on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media about these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
furthermore , I start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only rely on solutions that have been developed differently .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be receiver , instead of being M@@ acher .
solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : USA and Europe .
projects are encouraged differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or move here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are in your routine research , which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous assistance with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding science methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught in order to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there are need of special scientific training starting in any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from being very benefit .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges .
the system , that magazines are only accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how to change global food production as &quot; open Source &quot;
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reported about solution for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton chast@@ ised let@@ tu@@ ce to the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ress , the first plant , which grew from NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been eaten .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ ar work was only supported by its own obj@@ ections and the question of how many sal@@ ads can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more was patented , and that he could not be used to use it .
the patents have not only been used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or green leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cere@@ al or cart@@ on imports . due to this trends , plant bree@@ ders , environmental prot@@ ector , and experts for food safety ensure that of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , M@@ orton denied a salad , however , however , he needs longer , since his work is always worth more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as I lie in a river , around which I have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents have to go far too far .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed more a new sal@@ ads , because all features have already been patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tries to ap@@ point those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he is also connected to a movement that is always getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have far@@ med red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the variety of Out@@ red@@ oms in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; station and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name is rather so sounds as if the movement from the IT range originate and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by movement for free &quot; open Source &quot; software to insp@@ ire the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant bree@@ ders permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can also under@@ take that others can use seed freely from them .
however , this does not mean that they can do with their seed do not continue to do business and selling it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders allow only others who purchase seeds to breed , and not to be able to send their own varieties - two aspects which were banned or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
rough prospects
for the emer@@ al professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays with him a role in major merge such as biodiversity , rights of peas@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter or only little by using seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who wants to buy food , locally and sustainable produced vegetables , such as it is being offered on farms markets , should also know that the way is being bred , such as this vegetables is far@@ med .
nutr@@ itious levels without seeds in high quality is not possible . &quot;
the members of the open source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to provide other seed remains free of charge . in contrast , their anticip@@ ation is to be patented , seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk since the available Gen@@ o@@ pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , in@@ abl@@ ishment .
Claire Lu@@ by , president of the O@@ ss@@ i , engaged in her doctoral thesis with gen@@ etic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , making it possible for plant bree@@ ders either not or worth it .
for other plants , such estimates exist not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by means that mass@@ aging plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots .
a question of sight
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted characteristics - from such as their taste or their color improves up to such as they grow in certain environments and withstand thre@@ ats like p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders are constantly decreasing by more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before , because the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property will promote other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations &quot; innovation . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired .
often this instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
such a protection , i.e. , does not support innovations , but promotes to public more material and know @-@ how to be provided . &quot;
M@@ orton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long , to breed plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one could have lost the fight .
the main argument of M@@ orton , however , is that genetic resources always have been a general public and remain still to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what happened to us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , M@@ orton interfer@@ ed on the concept to pat@@ ron@@ ing plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants make them themselves and as bree@@ ders , we do not have any idea how to do the plants .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ ders in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breeding a variety can also breed his own values in them .
those who believe in the industrial agriculture with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for the cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is obvious . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they are able to survive the most smaller seed companies - either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank M@@ orton looks for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also the fact that bree@@ ders would be innovative through the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ters of innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new than the company , the patented .
I need a new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , to make it easy for my opinion .
although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; open Source &quot; breeding , the concept spreads very quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . on receipt of the seed of traditional bu@@ cks , the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ ements works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license which ultimately resulted in a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for the breeding differ from country to country , due to the O@@ ss@@ i obligation not just one can be taken one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventi@@ onally , conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventi@@ onally bred plants .
however , a statement is not a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ ern@@ ity of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , states that the organization is currently preparing a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should fall next year of the official start date .
an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group at ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity in the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a ban and aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others , giving the view that farmers have to come to seed , to share and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply with food supplies can be ensured .
in the report the importance of a varied , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , by Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i , hopes it will soon be recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mostly counted , where and how anything is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government closed the site of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) that documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this stage and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the original Network for Human Rights Information has been ab@@ stain@@ ed , despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution . even though it was never so difficult to follow these goals and to follow victims in the Arab world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was never so important to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome the sperm and do not follow . we hope to continue our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent News page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1st human rights organisation of the wave of web pages like victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i have one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language h@@ tt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research group Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog which he set up in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ion of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , which is home to the Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as the police practic@@ ed physical violence against two students .
his article relate mainly to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed a blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock blo@@ gs is very old , however , in the era of ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ wn of blo@@ gs may not be meaning@@ ful for the world , it is because of two reasons for me :
1 ) It happened to them to mediate in the sense of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the sperm blo@@ gs , as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have demonstrated that I did not wrote in vain . in other words : my words have an influence if you only have a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have closed him and , that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go to the end up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 6th of August 133 websites . this included technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ daf@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by changing Internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we realized how the locking of websites used by V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users .
in addition , the situation is wor@@ m@@ ert that the ignition decisions have closed behind closed doors , reducing the Egyptian population does not have legal basis , with which they can proceed against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

days of day , newspapers in Brazil with a new head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcards drawing .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school &quot; every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves &apos;s chem@@ ist &apos;s military weapons &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air forces to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a cl@@ amped financial situation , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reached the highest level in Rio in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on August 16th the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published .
the mot@@ ives for their decision stated :
extra will continue to report about crimes committed in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual behavior , etc . everything that happens to the ci@@ vil@@ ised standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the &quot; War &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we do not exclu@@ de our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ iness .
in a four @-@ minute video that was dealt on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , announced that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to data of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who do not shoot and ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than it used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira to describe the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion after a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to make responsibility for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in staff , education and a historical and self @-@ adhesive neg@@ le@@ ct of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the North and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the mor@@ nings per state , Rio is located 16 , &quot; she writes .

to these safety measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was one of the aim of creating a fav@@ ela by deployment of a massive police raid and a unit permanently station@@ ed there .
at the beginning , this did actually lead to a decrease in violent deaths . since several years , the U@@ PP was able to protect the U@@ PP after several reports about sh@@ ic@@ ans and repression against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , and increasingly under coating .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his article in 2010 , which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for people .
because this requires the state to use , means and ways to use the typical for a war . this is the penet@@ rating into the territory of a &quot; enemy &apos; , with which a civil is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; ir@@ reversible balls . &quot;

one week is now that the police force the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident happened : a fruit seller died as a consequence of shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the association PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack on chemical weapons was caused by hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime was committed .
since 2013 , these rebels have been controlled by rebel groups outside of Damascus , which led to the fact that inhabitants are provided by tun@@ nels and control points covered by tun@@ nels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as an anti@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the conventional , herbal foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ ting of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultiv@@ ate mushroom picking , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project known and pressed his relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge to plant@@ ing mushrooms so Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this writing , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is applied on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity of 80 % .
locally produced fuel made from plastics used because of the fuel scar@@ city , to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Teacher School &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach man the fung@@ al breeding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ supply by eating the food ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food .
creating new work@@ places , especially for women who work at home .
the creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege is visible .
we want to insp@@ ire our experience people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot;

Portuguese challenge justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people were protest@@ ing on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were gr@@ ated in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the last week of solidarity with victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires are also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire break@@ through@@ s that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and spread around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Pe@@ dr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande occurred a similar tragedy in which there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured fires .
according to the European forestry management system that monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 acres of forest are burned - a surface of the size of the district of Lisbon alone .
so you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better relief measures and fire fighting measures by the state .
people surveyed themselves , why the civil protection is not able to com@@ fy the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al , the Federal Republic of Portugal , declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pe@@ dr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did this Sunday somewhere : there are dozen reports of open streets , which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , because the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will be question@@ ing with high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a comprehensive proposal on the forest , which had brought the government to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was filed by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , if the applicant had a means of protection to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads João Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cross @-@ organisation Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made out of light burning wood , like in a devil , after fires of this species always wide .
regarding these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal is coming from Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents searched for or tried to contact people who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : you used the own civilian data using the application of f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population at real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade in October so that the server pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400,000 users who followed the fires , didn &apos;t count the site more than half a million .

the journey from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years before , a fear@@ ful civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and desper@@ ation .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati is a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the G@@ haz@@ ni Province in Central Afgh@@ ani , for the last time with his family during dinner together .
even though his mother didn &apos;t go back then , she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more .
the boy was to break up in the morning .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , who dominated the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , was just murdered by the Taliban and suddenly cont@@ ended on Haz@@ ara .
the Taliban always came closer to their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara well known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left out of his low wage , and went in Iran . once again , he found himself in a strange country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself , to earn his lifetime .
at that time , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran are affected by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we mounted nylon in front of the open window , so that we don &apos;t swim at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made it ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which was twice a day food twice a day .
indeed , Italy is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers . it &apos;s true , however , that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country is disa@@ stro@@ us .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; specific recording centers &quot; in the hands of impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can then be allocated to a recording center if they officially put an application for asylum -@@ which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum request .
till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his innocent life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
after having made several years of work in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af stir@@ red his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well , that he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Suc@@ cess Story the theme of the documentation &quot; Disabled d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan developed companies , including cutting groups , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen personnel are mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan businessman Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome there are also Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , extend far beyond the Italian ga@@ stronom@@ ic industries and the retail , and aim to the country that he had to leave the country as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and must get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af decor@@ ates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; thus , they can improve their appetite on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Egyptian Parliament has reviewed a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency .
users would have to use to use the social networks within six months of successful law@@ suit in the website of the authority under speci@@ fying the full name and their identification number .
those who have missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the processing committee as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of a member of the legisl@@ ature filed a law@@ suit in which har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the president or a high civil servants would be introduced .
under the Egyptian right the ins@@ ist of the President as well as government agencies have already been pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law there would be such a case with prison and fin@@ es , as right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is supposed to be approved , this could mean until three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would also under@@ take a political climate , in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom was already in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud plan Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers to demonstr@@ ate violence against demonstr@@ ators who led to the military coup that led to the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison on a court .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until the 20th May , because the prison for human rights groups failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the court of jurisdiction .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threat@@ ening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups include arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case there was a criminal court in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Tribunal also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ian activists heard about continuous documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the ple@@ dge of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily associated with a consistent action plan . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , which explicitly supports a controversial bill , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali could have accused of corruption of the official am@@ nesty .
that was published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , creates a light to look like the pre@@ defined plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ affir@@ med the nam@@ ing of its sources under article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press association , which repor@@ ters the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in Tunis , he joined the Tunis Regional Court in Tunis on 9 May .
will China force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations on the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China before they write messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is stated that the registration will be necessary with the full real name .
analy@@ st clari@@ fied that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments will be reached in the social networks within the social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities can apply these provisions .
Chinese national citizens proposed in the social media , these regulations are only sel@@ ectively en@@ forced to protect citizens , journ@@ alism and independence .
then we look at &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?

in May , the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia stopped access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , joined the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is organizing a list of online services that allows the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to transmit content responsible for removing content and force on request to trigger user data .
these websites include websites like V@@ contacted and Od@@ no@@ classic ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service email .@@ ru and dozens of other services .

a Turkish court had the blocking of Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators have refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ speaking articles , Turkey , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Marine Affairs and Communication , has been locked to the site because it works on &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups in order to stim@@ ulate a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is therefore , among others China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
