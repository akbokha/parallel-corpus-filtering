<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, American music dance, American writers and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-student who had the Supreme Court with judges who had his interest to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was it as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything that I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always the one who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of its ascension is to me as he goes with his narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so nice.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and declared publicly its contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless the people responded to his statements and tuned to him for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won with the republican vote was the highest number ever achieved by the party of nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biguck person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters not with people in harmony I had met myself during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic program, taking people from around the world, a deep glittering human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, trumps also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," agreed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity which I experienced for Sandy Bahr who fights for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet it fits with the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped us to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump on his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they had a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The meditation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they were either shared by racism and fanatism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost the heart beat me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is not fair to designate the dump-voters than Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people submit, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficially and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act on another way and thinking.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters are voted, of which most of them are tuned for Trump, because they want to recover the control of a country that has disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with regard to those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm. the WC.: as much as "Rejection of white against all other ethnicity"; word game made of white in response to the white and whichma), as the big Van Jones called it exactly what America has so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country was chosen as his President, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he himself says he would be possible somewhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white of America this promise and says: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11 the white man is back again at the Ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">At all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who fell down in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd covered the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone could, who is not like you, a place in your US?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was ordained.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaian city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, does not only change the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill station, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from the nearby cantonal ruins and its world famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which has found their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for its drugs misuse and the Bane violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth offered so a rare hopeliness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI said:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch race them through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically in the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in the capital city - on instruments which are made from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments which consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under management of Favio ChÃ¡vez thus began to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion who were all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayic and Latin American music as well as music by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez recalls a local eco-ologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, to the beginning of:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had not had space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same position, the children had not known music and it was very difficult to contact their parents, because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something which he had never seen: one out of a waste has produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from restored material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion metric tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the poorest - as people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational show of garbage-to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has played its music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted for international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa this ship was known that this ship had already operated in Liberia fishing waters before the other coast of Africa began.</seg>
<seg id="101">The eastern African countries were brought accordingly to this and slightly inclined to call a law of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they refused to spend one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier is surrounded by countries that simply refused everything" "", "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered the ship in the day and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not managed to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the pillaging of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa was founded as a network of countries around the NRO stop illegally (Illegal fisheries) in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had driven out the Premier of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "thus we have eight countries that are simultaneous and work together. they share information from and stand on each other, where there is illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is being caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to send it because it is illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate discontempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delikates equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing was once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions now happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange the lists of existing licenses, news of suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships to detect ships in forbidden areas - some such that suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies show whether the involved ships have a fish catch, where they were on the road and possibly even if they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can be allowed on the basis of these information, then that the ships can not sell their cargo in their ports. and that they even could not be sold to numbers of penalties, as in the case of Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means the illegal fishing catch is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Berber company dedicated to the struggle against illegal fishing companies in Africa and is also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which lose eight members of the HISH Network for every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms, attracting the area of commercial fishing from around the world. among these even more illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">These practices and other actions include the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying Phantasiennames, fish protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they are using the lack of international cooperation and the weaknesses of a non-bridge control system" "", "says Long." "" "a ship was illegal fishing and a country could say" "" "You must not start my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal conclusion tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigative ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has been exposed to criminal networks, distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several deceitful identities and found it volatile ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances and received.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organizational crimes" "", "Bergh says." ""</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed, also helps to open the Illegal Ships that likes to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst with Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO which also offers technical support with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch for example their automatic identification systems, which they cannot be saved by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different sources of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Maritime Organization Oceana platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be indicated by means of every single traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "gather with the neighbours to get a better picture of it," "" "whoever does," "" "he just makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and protect their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project, with which a global system permits persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminating but they are quenching.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously run without license and hardly any consequences had to be reckoned with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i reported a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fisheries has more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to open Greko 1, the inspectors took place on board locks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that now other countries are able to copy us," says Kiilu. "we are going to disappear every hundred million dollars from illegal fishing every year.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries joined together in 2015, at the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight the illegal fishing, after exactly the same model as FISH. "" "" safety is the aim of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions. "" "" Copeland says. "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's recent member of Somalia was to report his first major triumph in October: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was under false flag. not only was the ship to go on without a license and have been used to tow nets, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still incorporated in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "with the take-of-rules against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing catch," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum to the President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela was denied the request of opposition to a referendum, the Venetians reacted, in whose eyes negotiations over the political and economic crisis of the country, when they gathered themselves to the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the withdrawal of Venezuela), both pictures of this demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the country estate of Barinas, in the Andenregions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, centrally located in the central North of the federal state Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation in the country deteriorates continuously, what happens in everyday life of the Venetians through a acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro saw the chance for a fundamental change; ultimately, the abolition of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the following article in the context of government statements as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation rate in the world include the inflation rate of food and medicine, the referendum for many as the only way to conquer the country to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of a interviews by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quixano, the origin of the origin on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and will be published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quixano was forced from his father, the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine town of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quixano said in the context of the large La Perla Ribera process in Cordoba's province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes examined that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quixano hasn't sought out his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the BÃ¼rde, the same name as his father had to carry up to the brutal military operations in La Perla, whom he observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family confidentiality for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a saleslean.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years old you don't know that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I could not know that my father was a thief, Following and Murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quixano was Gendarmerchanter. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the ZPerla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quixano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archivist.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quixano, the oppressed, which is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who recognized the extent of the atrocities which he had experienced as a boy, and said before a German court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent-part over his child, and as this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take part in the military base, I often went into the sports hall. I had joined me with a boy, the martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later, he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to read more advertisements from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake had fallen to the translators of Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-published daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawed English translation has been removed first. the term "(German:" terrible drivers ") was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatisch did not quite correct the correct name" Elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police prefecture of Kyoto preapologized for the translation errors. furthermore, it declared that the error was already contained in the text, and that the translation was not tested for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "I'm sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (the translation)" "", "the police said." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-cast News continued a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of" "" "fearful" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was refused as an appropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers are wrapped in accidents that are nationwide in accidents, but certainly cause to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by the seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 had a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The namic not mentioned reporters brought in the version of the article comments on the light that show what prejudice some Japanese spoke against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo via the translation errors, among others, received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible driver ") about reality?"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and to be active language skills to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of target - something that is in the case of motherboards. generally, the conviction that translators may be in the target language - not in the source language - mother tongue should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native speaker should translate into English for example from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue to make translation into English. this may be a lack of understanding of the overflow, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, however, do not have any foreign employees. then, the Japanese employee, whose English language knowledge is the best to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language knowledge are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The resulting and enigmatic phrases which arise through machine translations, show that this technology can't replace many human translators. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry nor acceptable or at least harmless. but by big companies or from the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and protest action on the Internet and television</seg>

<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, the Venezuelan Internet users have no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet opening of VPITV and El Capitolio TV could not be accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online transmitter overtook photos of the protests in Caracas, which have been organized by oppositional groups to resist the NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the Executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is linked, and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page by @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular among veneers with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been in the reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with penalties and closure, when they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked this as a "Call to Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I have logged back to @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and the informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this continues to buy cheaper than two litres of Limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay by a blocking of the domain name System (DNS) is inaccessible, but also two more online broadcaster. this also applies the website to which the National Assembly broadcasts her meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research activities of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group of digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local internet provider would utilize DNS. this is a technique to answer the DNS server requests by certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server respondent or denied the request when calling to such website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV-camera is Elvis Flores, who took over the protests in Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was defeated, while he was located in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government was regulated, so that the government is regulated by Internet connections: thus the Venetians will keep access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a large family with little money overlays her minors son or her minors daughter to another, more abundant family. at the exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned, is that the children must pay for many days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and mistreatments - and all that can not be raised in the context of a contract that is not able to lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This, known as Criadazgo, is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance through large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing his studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo practice - collected witness statements, recherished and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the Criaditas, ensuring breastfeeding in general.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n entered the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of heavy strokes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military belonging to TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an officer at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck as long as with a stick on MarÃ­n until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>

<seg id="445">You recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest confisations and demanded that there was no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, among which conditions do boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations required a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girls who her Criadita was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment.</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when Farbik worked in which their father worked, bankruptcy, and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>

<seg id="462">She got every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>

<seg id="503">If he is accepted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt during a government authorities to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law then a passage would be arranged to use citizens, citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law the user would have to register users with their right names and number of staff to use social networks to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt is Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs on the Internet and are used to communicate with others by voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is thought when it is assumed that the draft may not affect the user's users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="516">When I take them seriously, it means that it may apply a strong monitoring system to feed citizens, or not. and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to carry out a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not far realistically - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must be discussed at the legislature's legislature and the Constituency before being debated into the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his adoption and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military monument in parliament, in which the sense is maximized and ensured that no different narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the Northeast of Iraq are the veterinary surgeon Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature in Iraq to protect the gateful Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger leopards of the Leopards, which are surrounded by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). there are a total of between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are at risk of prey, loss and fragmentation of their living space.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of Leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a large space is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see an Persian leopard actually is small and goes on to zero. as the team in video therefore, she portrays that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As trained biologin shows Raza passionate about another side of their country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in field trials in wild animals and education for six years.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: stand of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed on 11 March 2011 by the tsunami and still remains the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, which had been advantageous for the North-East Japan, were to rebuild the life of those who were affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami, and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, that is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was an ectionary prefectures in Japan's Northeast who had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring capital of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to disappear, because the tsunami had vanish all coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, just around 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (the oiljesoiljesouei juutaku) was completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima joined the final light against Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">It is still trying to settle for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of Behelfsqueries, which reacted in final spare homes for six years.</seg>
<seg id="555">According to the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Fukushima was evacuated from Fukushima in 2011, while working in notices, while Miyagi had more successful. more than 75 percent of evacuated evacuated after the disaster in containers were moved into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">Status of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung, 1074 of 1100 schools have been affected by the disaster until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now operational, only 30 percent of fisheries have recovered their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian agricultural land has withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi restored 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has again recovered again, but also the Fukushima remained undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are 90 percent of the same stand as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can only be 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe, almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuated through. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and also, how their recommendation is changing compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of the local inhabitants have taken the measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents say that there was still not enough in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How about those who are evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear disorder, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were placed in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live outside the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated, which are still more than 50 years old. they have to go back in proper accommodation, because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is about construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be bigger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one often recognizes that more than it appears to be at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important because they want to challenge our prejudices to expand our perspectives and recall us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat themes that often get less attention when they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember to a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to someone over the language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni says about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egheri explains how the love for music has worked in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the period where they worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences, which he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories included the doors in Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Parish Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there is no significant sugar beating from the town.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were settled in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the hanging, the sugar cane industry was silent in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the scaffold was left of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and moving daily on the factories that are still grinding.</seg>

<seg id="634">He heard that it is in the east of the region of sugar cane factories, which have been in operation after a long time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly that in MaÃ±alich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already the plagues, the fall of Socialism, the low market prices, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar imports switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The comminution of the sugar cane industry was an economic need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they were inseparable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound according to the 2016 report "Landwirtschaftspektiven" by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Nutritional Health Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar exports would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="655">The same happened in the Surohrfactory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, is the word that he is repeated most, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree, not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first night seasons, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents to be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultimo Rosales del Toro, only the minister could be approve.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there, responsibility and letters were always more common.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar beet factory closed, or better said when they began to cancel them, they also listened to asphalted to asphalted the street, and also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future perspective, many young people left the region at once.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production does not serve once for the supply of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant continues to be impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016 Nene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Neundundforty gave the old soldiers a lot of two thousand Peso per month to spend the years at retirement in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man black skin colour, small, with few teeth and clear voice, is not a traverse person, yet he giveth the lies, which one told him, not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been torment him for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they can do with hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour since 2014, workshops will bring mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec, with ten Cree communities, and then collaborated with the Cree Hip Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases the young participants in our conversations such as "cultural identity," language, meditation, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever you can find in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school "Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo, in the area of the tribe of Kitsumkalum First nation in British Columbia, is telling the history of the Highway 16, also" Highway of tears, "in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important is the most of the traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters don't always have to rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation recorded, the refracture is sung in Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youth participated in a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-Hop group who gave them a drop in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when nobody cares for me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I continue to go on Earth for my days on the earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you receive our cry,</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will be able to raise us one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">Thus they can grow and forward to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do what it determined to the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also creates a post and adds the Strophe in Silbenign (which is also published on his blog and will be published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see almost every restaurant of plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show the potential customers what exactly are available on the menu, are attached to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the entrance to the "" "" plastic models of dishes "" "") of each food that is served in this restaurant. "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Cappabashi district of Kappabashi, there is a wide variety of these small businesses that perform those plastic dishes, who documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually found that they don't even listen to them all. a new trend is transformed into current mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Near Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series of social media reviews and photos that show this unusual Twist with the shook sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic-made decorative tapes, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschoned collection, as in this case, coolbox, magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shot refrigerated magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essentials is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular travel shell with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing plough to the coming.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon are cheated, a popular Topping, that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant to surprise.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melamine cream.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and hand belts from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of in- and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the mixes and mockers regularly immersed in statistics. however, these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that brings together this battle.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the sadness or to the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bone, behind each bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has called the digital project "Aprtender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking,"), "that these victims should give a voice and stories of people who were fighting for the fight between criminal law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops include because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to travel many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" "" "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" "" "(german:" "" "how fear lives" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that seeks every weekend secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who, on only one day their father, lost their four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today again to the task that we have given us to get rid of and to the graves, to the people whom we loved to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th, he would be back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="769">My mother, which is here with me, is also my mother.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You stand the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out, because they ask a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get? "</seg>
<seg id="773">"" "the editors of" "" "Aprender a vivir con el narco" "" "explain why the project is so important:" ""</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who imagine the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state of governance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading from Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been aware of the disease and sensory journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm getting over every day in newspaper kiosks and see the title page with pictures that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling, as if I am the only one who am pressed, or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to the body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be valid either, or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers), if it is great. and it is not normal that people listen to the "heroism" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, it is, when they defied those who have lost someone who have lost someone, and those who fear them so something happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are to blogging numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The crime of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighboring village that they were "refuelling."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk about such tragedies, if they don't stir and still are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of print in the main city District." this describes her, as armed crime month for month money from their business until they did not only destroy the business, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are apart from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "we want to be arrested, because they don't know when they will lead you or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I asked if weeping would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, for I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the post "The forgotten children by Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of Israel-called Generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he throws questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the dangerous city of Mexican?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and He told that he had to teach himself how to make an egg, boiled potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left hand - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with them.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was already over two years ago, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody dead of his father, who was shot by armed men from a sitting car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence contributed by the organised crime and fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of victims of civil security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the public prosecutor's office is 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories which leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are still living in the face of a new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprusa Vivir Con El Narco," the journalism project has called Narco data into life, whose aim is to set the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in understandable manner.</seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" from the Flickr users Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and the pages, to which he expire, contain pictures, on which violence is shown.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in one moment in which it comes to lifting a rumor, or to unmask counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after being immersed for the first time? content in social media, whether it's true or true, tend to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible disorder seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been used to use irradiation, tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false Coupling of Image and Event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - Do not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, it throws questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker wagons the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa, Africa's second largest country has been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with impact holes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to a victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government representatives describes a fire-ball, covered houses, including a cinemas in the vicinity, that was full of people who illustrate the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses waste and canned bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unmistakiness.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture of the title "This is Nigeria." from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the lecture forms the grey scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">At the top is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of carbonized body, which are excited on the floor while people watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here is the story not their end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was fished for several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, however, real but not to be attributed to the related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram took part in Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and burnt down in streets and bones.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures couldn't be confirmed." "" "no one stayed back to count bodies," "" "said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were crushed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images the following time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the army service point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here, the image from the DR Congo appeared again, as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failure rates; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of massage.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example accidentally the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightening message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee slicks, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against Rohingya, Posts told how the following descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from a Saudi-Arab news page, which in 2012 claimed that President Myanmars Than being said, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to describe this information.</seg>

<seg id="858">Other news agencies, the AFP as their source, had also attributed to Than Being this statement, but had not been associated with the image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global range of false information</seg>

<seg id="861">"" "using a" "" "returned picture search" "" "you can see how far more information can exceed." ""</seg>
<seg id="862">A re-returned picture search with the TinEye has found 344 pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images, which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They originate from a mixed masch of private pages, platforms social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages like English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="907">This post, which addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church, presents clear that the picture of the DR Congo doesn't show Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Than being released in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time this publication is still included in this publication.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by now, published by the Catholic close of the news page AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture was not taken by the killings, but it claims that it has a "similar dshift attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later used in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 in circulation, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist that there would be links to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yorthin yaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo appeared, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and caused a discussion under Muslims after the massacres of the Boko Haram 2015 and the connections on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities found this events that was alleged in the name of Islam, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The image has been witched as a proof for the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times retweed). but the messages that were associated with them were taken up in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the target was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that supposedly had been written by a "pater Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre in circulation, the discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Claretiner missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos were distressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a defective use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>

<seg id="925">(data transfer with URLs and time / data estamp exist on the web crawler and in connection they have image names related to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases that previously appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010, the image could ultimately be a correct description, but the original entry is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (irradiation) that attract these podium. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to major discussions about the silence in the context of Muslims by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the murder of Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is rated as compared to European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth to investigate how images are used in the context of these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, if readers cannot give these pictures more faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are ninety people who are unintentionally threatened to exercise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggerated this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are intrue and narrowly the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The proliferation of violent pictures has already been debated (e.g., for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures even demands even by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern, that forcible images and viewers are desirable and to take the ability to empathy empathy (such as this study, which seek to work as nonviolent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss nonviolent representations in the media media, fact that they are indispensable for the present news release.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will need to think about situation in which an image suggests something, but what actually is used from the context or completely abused type can be used.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation, however, should also be considered as internationally as internationally.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. unobsolvable) is trying to provide a choice of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that often are very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others that are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish brake).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists stubborn every attempt of an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist von "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu system, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Entry your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the convenience or sloth that you feel after being in the sun in cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They sander other cultures, reveal other ideas and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we analyze the world around us and classify the Linguists on this page still want to show more of these "untranslated" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are very much appreciated by nontranslatable, are invited to upload your favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1119">There is a reason that conspiracy theorist, which existed in the dark corners of the Internet, now also lead the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1120">They have grown exponentially because they made Muslims to "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group that has exponentially grown by creating the "other" created.</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years ago, it had not given them yet; now they rule over great regions in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the history, which I was not aware of, when I was so old now, as it is now my daughter, but who made me today to an irreversible muslima.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I left here like a break of bread in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things could wake up memories, as in all the interactions that makes our humankind, likes a story, where anyone is made to another "others."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Just now, on the other side of the bridge at Berkeley find conversations in the context of the 8th Annual Conference to Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than one hundred academics talk about our problems with the "others", "structural Racism" and "American militarism."</seg>
<seg id="1128">But these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or read our newspapers in our newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves, why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the influence of the "others" in the public presentation, about four decades of self-scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of aware, deliberately and unconsciously imagine the "others" in which we have no idea that we had not bombed a new future while he already capitated countries and "others" people were bombed, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can it be possible to enter here and now despite a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the number of stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported a short initiative by Steven Bird, the Untranslated Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language diversity of big cities and to be worthy.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not to be handed over to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we are cities, accepting cities - safe spaces, in which people don't have to forget who they are to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often this is linked to understand," these events instead can "" "" listen to "" "" to feel good. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller print their history first in their own language and translates them to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants don't have a professional storyteller, their dedication and their representation is that the listener can be placed on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storytale narration Rassidatou is also the opportunity to explain the opportunity for their country typical customs of heritage.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fabel of the Hoses and the Pavian in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the importance of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide Grinsen he shares his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">To date, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities took place, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can be contacted by TLS in order to organize their own story.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new testing of public debt of Puerto Rico, who took home to 72 million US dollars on April 3, 2017, taking several religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puerÃ­o Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group of Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda "(the Front for the neural examination of the debt) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intersection of the new debts of the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos requires that the politicians, banks and government authorities, are responsible for the debt of their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial examination and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with sinking pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the territory integrated in the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization with a focus on socio economic development, a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state of state.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed by the outside are to be held without the participation and conviction of the citizen who will be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration carried the name "Nightwatch for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrically Palestinian WEBENTWICKLER Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his support and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference of the digital culture, which will be held in Berlin, dedicated to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a historian in France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book sprints' made books of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inden (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is licensed here, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to be built as movements for free knowledge and what the true costs are, with which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on site to watch over the fog, who gives our newsfeeds and make some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled by the directory of the Adra-prisons, in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that waited for his release and want him to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us can begin to think about their own destinies, acts and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timely extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The WTWICKLER, open source and digital activist, has been in jail since March 2012 in the Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility sent to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Basle was based on a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented himself as the Insider of the Assad government and set them up by an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place location and state remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in it to expand access to the Internet and to knowledge about the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Engineer and currently negotiate the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes competed as the work which he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 around the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waypoint of numerous civilizations and here melt greek-Roman architectural models with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything about it, this architecture that is not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stress to the digital archeology and conservation has created a set of time that will be the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet able to finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life in order to dream of freedom and Bassel, taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought English to me, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well, to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught others taught English to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught other prisoners as they use computers, at least in theory that they actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a provocation, which she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She whispered the lyrics, when she visited him, he translated them out of the Arab in English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I think in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the dangers doesn't matter me,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the skirt of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I go in every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I bear with my passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes are farewell</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And in your absence to cry and to smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>

<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian network for Human Rights (Syrian network for human rights) since the beginning of the protests in 2011, the Syrian network for Human Rights (Syrian network for human rights) have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence through the regime were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community urges the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our claim in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: sentenced due to corruption and dismised post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">The Muslims reacted to a corruption incident in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence in the state apparatus after the corruption was celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other accused.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds provided by Mozambique, the Council of Cambaza, between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good lead and immediately requested his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which granted the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, again to obtain his old post as the company had no disciplinitis after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">But many inhabitants do not have the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Health (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, shortly CIP), a local institution that establishes itself for public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision to set up the company:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Imagine a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a setback in regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company should also have launched a disciplinous procedure against the refuses.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company was apparently apparent and caused no appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior as well as opposed to the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be counselors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and that half of them had absent.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since it is incompetent, he has decided to integrate into the company which he helped harm damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is like to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradicted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he incriminated him, I can't believe someone who rewards it in such a way that has already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the moral to return and serve the state * he had already serving a unique opportunity to serve the state but has only served itself on the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state when it was weary for an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself is wearied, the pretensioning and finally condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte is preferred to recall the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel the Mosambikaners not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as sharp, cutting-cutting and - as well as said - Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he confirmed energetic, that "an ambitious person is to be able to sell his own individual interest, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambitioned man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he does not apply from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">A ambitious person is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also aboutdated:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and came free.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took its posts from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to point to people ostindic origin or generally used as an adjectivity. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is expressed by the word "Kalar" or for the oddling-soloddling (in burmical writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Over the past few years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely valuable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra Nationalists as Hassspeak against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight them in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word at itself will not call them automatically." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts who have discussed the word of the word or have doubts about the use of his instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage),' Kalar oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooky Aung Kaung Myat declared the various meanings of words by the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on spiritual way if she could wake her back pain, as he made his back pain by doing a vocalist.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hats is the opinion that she must decrease radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analyst to spread out all posts that are suspected to spread in the suspected hour of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It will filter the Word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automism will not understand what you write on factions.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should do instead is carefully analyse the post and check it by check out the post-standing words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age switch).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dirty nationalists, which hate me, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its Nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion has a strong signal to all, the hate language may distribute the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of percussion often have a catz- and mouse game, where users can simply start social networks just to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his poet, when he just wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and told me the liken, post and share of Content for 24 hours, says the Post Community's Facebook community not deciding. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a number of people away from people who have no negative intentions, or trying to show their opinions against the hate talk radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Next without Hassspeech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion about it, why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should do more than the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmical Internet Community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a swollen intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censored will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it seems that if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned as words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "builder curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried not to justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If it's just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks are automatic censorship for much spells among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage to see if your posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts that no hate language abstained, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Using permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burmetic text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch the curry curry and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook contains the Post, which contains the word of Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the Post says" "" "If you are a doctor, you heal humans?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, using permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, which have used social networks, has increased their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassler should also be in charge of violence in the municipalities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine territory, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been awarded for his promise to criticized out Hasselt on his burmese sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just use the word 'Kalar', it would have better running on context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the Ehegesetzes, some members of Muslim religious communities held in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, gathered that the State should not be mixed because that, at the age, not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN child's rights Convention, the minors of children under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical agency confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that strives to abolish laws for pedigrees, followed at the foot and became great support. undoubtedly, they helped us to mediate this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">An Hindu-guide, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's children, they should be damned to care about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition tensions to tension in this actually incomplicated matter, and sometime were doubts that the opposition would agree at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, in early 2017 the bill was decided against the children's children - despite 4 Senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent that was discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make it a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now, only the president of the country has to vote and announce the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update which has again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's accession was in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided before the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws have been last modified.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who is a prime minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary sound needed, which has caused the core of the matter, but do you know what? the child's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it was definitely going long enough to finish the practice was Lara Quentrall-Thomas overhappy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Ehegesetz has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who listened to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society which said quite openly about how important is the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The design for the amendment of the Ehegesetzes was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The House of Representatives there are 41 MPs and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MPs, who were contrary to the law, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Children's before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childmarriageable childbirth.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who have laid him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congrats.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Thanks to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, a secretary general of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to do judicial steps, the law should be approved, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, meant that Maharaj would like to go against the law, most social media users would wish to be held the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we can, instead of talking about the discussion, in a way that we invite you to accept the state into our bedroom, that the state, our daughters, protects them from large, hard-minded men who are abused against them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a judicial approach to the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children's before in different gradations or remains the norm, although there is laws, which they undersay.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series turns against the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article published by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most of the ordinary Wikipedia users don't fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been locked in an article by Wikipedia, as recently published in an published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place since 2007, after the Internet Act was adopted (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain closed, there are now several Mirror pages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often are updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlan File System), when the platform shut down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus calculator machine connections), which is based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is irrevocable despite the ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>

<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if you cannot reach the site www.wikipey.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorderly motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">"" "" "" "this motivated him to wear and try to graze the situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepalese lives to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And its native place right next to Chitwan National Park, it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that guide the attention on Nepalese world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this first-class location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when I called Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti River is a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to crack pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to achieve a cooperation with the authorities to attain global recognition for Nepals nature and want to understand the understanding that wild animals are not so fearful as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he rose from face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb with the opinion of the sheep at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I also was because of darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he immediately sets us, and he starred me through the Sal of Sal!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and Wildlife is not always simple.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He was waiting for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent that lasted up to 12 days, until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist destination.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released here as part of a Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there is women with the greatest care to talk the names of their husbands or even from older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a ponomic or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Channisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should be miserable, this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced to the Indian state Oglia by a headcourt and away from her family and the village of the village, after they had addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of wives also did not call on behalf, is also common among men. however, they are far from less conceivable, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus fast to the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the enemy of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community video Volunteers and sets itself for mining the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the cover of practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how this club created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made the ambassadors of the murals at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion group showed women who did not call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It was chosen for this issue because she wanted to open the talk about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to talk the names of their husbands, it is a brilliance charged, which they have not guilty to all obligations and have never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't keep it, is considered a backrest, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition has so deeply rooted that we have never made ourselves up to this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband before the name, wanted to try out at home, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother-in mother.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband weigh still long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned back to me, and said, I should call him by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage started Rohini started its first discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected from all girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the names of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands on the lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which he married women to the names of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise only got kiched; another decided to leave the entire enchanted frustrations for him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the Adrenalinexchange, with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually try to be at home to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a wide range of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas put her in his head: his wife did not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner prior to the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in mother murdered her, she got anxiety and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practitioners, such as carrying the jovial red point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnored point when he would also open it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I heard him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women stopped not completely, but my, they are now in a better position to choose even to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion lub is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at every discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water, go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced and sang, and talked about things about which they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have worked on some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands, never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things to say noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we have maintained the concept of honor and as it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted to bear a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt about a trousers; they have not darnel.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the preferences of their own coat-election, the morals associated with the Saris and much more, pretty rough Rohini (Oberhemden) in a discussion round that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan an excursion to Goa while they can carry out Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to make it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion, Rohini confirms that the things are slowly coming to the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done so far small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried a few times, but then heard it back to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, inside me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say still the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion lub know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the feiling for more freedom of movement or their own closet - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By turning itself mutually self-confidence, they will deliberate that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club, each of us, gives us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman comes home with the club and tell others of it what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from selected groups in India and make videos about stories, which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of prisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has moved attention to international community since his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state-dangerous), after having calls on the draft of the Charter 08, a Manifesto which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has referred to" "" "an internal issue" "" "and narrator, he considered it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet China will continue to receive views from the international community, Nobel Peace Laureates and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, to allow him to allow a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, different are completely out of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure in order to enable Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into the store after the Nobel Peace Prize was granted to Liu, although the Norwegian government had overhurried that this ultimately had nothing to do with decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued only in December last year. in June, Norway was signed an agreement to return to China, since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the message that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to increase his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on which China was asked to liberate Liu and his wife immediately to liberate under house arrest and to him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini also called for China to release Lius, as she hasted in a statement on June 30, 2013:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Lius's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They shall all meet and receive all visits, which they desire, and be able to communicate free with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador of Terry Branstad told us that Americans wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, inso far as to help him in his genesis. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message must not allow the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The petition of U.S. Embassy withdrew from China to a raging response from China, with the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to unite himself and irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Poland shared that China should offer the couple following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel agent and access to the medical care of its choice, which they are entitled to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senate Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to push for the Chinese government, Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing of the News Agency Reuters, that China had great concerns, whether the vortex could overtake a visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum, called for China to provide appropriate medical care to provide and give it the opportunity to provide himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Bar told Him that Lius woman, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone out, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he is, irrespective where, needed. furthermore, his wife and family will have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, there was no further information that France will eventually take it up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of solids in Taiwan called for China to release Liu on 27 June and require a greater tolerance to those who require peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>

<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in a statement on 28 June at Liu very worried and gave that many asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for whom he had been punished, had led to a harmonious, more stable and wealthy whose China had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and law of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This statement triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the meeting of the International branch of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked in question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, whereby most people go to a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "to turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and offered to create this valuable country, we hear that we eventually have no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the state of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons conducted by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, it was inevitably democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are led permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old lyre from the authoritarian Machines emerges, the advance of democrats, leaving logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final aspect, the answers of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judictative, our political system truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions tarts with non-answers to rational art.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to illustrate his mind as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"" "" "" "if Singapore is not a country but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmugam was to clarify this point, if he was paid highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he has published his comment on the reviews that you should start to read the full address of the conference to better understand the context of statements from Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the heading.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "", "he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so uneven better if we are looking forward to free and appropriate elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He is in Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party gain a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is no land," "" "he didn't know it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a modern generation, making such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes this is correct and is aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sets the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanmugam has committed a mistake "or was it a Freudder Speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the governmental institution, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why are the Singaporean of their military service, but they only defend their own country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems many Singaporean to have offended...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defence of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite true." ""</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors of certain parts of the world uncovered and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is put to me in Japan is: "are you an American?"</seg>

<seg id="1745">Then, in my clarification, the default response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians are perhaps boil within anger when they are kept for Americans, but did not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that distinguishes the Canadian of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack, if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">They all love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans are....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried a little maple sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada also is considered the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends which I really admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would make me nothing if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as "nice" to be called, is basically to be busy - as the goodiness, gentle, but tragically unsignificant figure Ned Flanders out of "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step forward. but the real problem exists, that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There is no corners and edges, nothing at which one can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if one wants to remain unnoticed in the background, far from things that pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I even would go far as far as to say that the desire, free and solely to be, a main partner of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what more extraordinated as" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool courtesy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often speak about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing hot warm, open kindness, which I connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau came the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has been almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop-Band released a music video which took over the Junta parodiert which took power in 2014, despite its promises to restore the civil government to continue the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which the rules of him makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly politically, the music video is based on the continued military domination of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook has been viewed 1,254 times and received 8.800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin-Video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand, after a group of activists present the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video you can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inspecial about how it keeps the situation of the country under the junta-rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that have been prosecuted for the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" possibly relate to the draconical section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which was given to Commander in Chief of the army's absolute decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme to "change change" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime against, whose vage and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to negotiate activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, the online content monitors and people who are accused of having slandered the monarchy to have been prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict ban against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 the martial law was proclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to buy, is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax veins.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how persons are thrown into a black delivery van before one brings them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and the Internet users are threatened to reprove the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org, published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a corprosa frame and gold colored bone earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. yet, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance hall there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of african and haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells people to call the people in full busses and from the upper part of the coast to call them: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but in this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They don't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that could not pay them, she massage them with a balm that exhaustive from the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in front of a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurche) pounded with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracks.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes, he answered with a smile." "" "I feel really that it fits on her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are in the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other signposts by Mama Africa. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Afrikaner often travel together the route and that Afrikaner is already talking to WhatsApp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his position, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">Since months he has been guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave it again," "" "he answered," "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez told that her guests will often send text messages when they went to grate them to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They declared that her Christian faith is the drive of its work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town a Sackgasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family met migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is Policist and has found that the buffets are sold to numerous African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep in ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he tells me." "" "I have experienced what they're experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was instructed in a raid on his labour place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to make money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a well-known, an all-stone, has offered him roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and it tries to decide where the next steps shall go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses we consult the traveler quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy about that her house is full, but she is nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandmother they pondered in her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair braid, who made her a Kundin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed, while she imagined it short.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeated every time every time. "they are already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users of the soloundary frost</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in Western China, are forced to install a spyware to their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users of the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification where it refers to the regional government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in Notification" "" "Notification" "" "it is said that the app" "" "provides access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities have also used the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app that they had installed the app with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app must determine the sources and the distribution ways of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make user attention online, how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers could manipulate the home network of a person to manipulate or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements from digital censorship in China mostly focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme conditions and surveillance measures, as well as routinely Internet servers.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This is based on Twitter based media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (moan), the censored news in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint where policemen were indiscriminately installed if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you find an checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use the people who are intended for elderly people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from Mainland China" "", "also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the characteristics of a Windows operating system, allowing them to unrestricted access to the computer's hard disk." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones are in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council, minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government buildings, authorities and with the party linked institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi, an order to all residents and entrepreneurs, to register their "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible violation, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib brings the majority of its time inside; sometimes he sacked to his canvas, sometimes on his computer, and again on his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But if you can rely on, there is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotin spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel saw his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felaheen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since the past six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, which the conservative majority was transferred to the well-proven opinion about gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and raping.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often dispossessed with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry. all these topics can not only be found in its home town of Amman, but also in cities committed by Damascus in Syria by far to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits, and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he doesn't open it, he sweeps against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his fellow feeling for those who are trying to do in war zones, some of what to do with his identity as "Palestinian gearing of the second generation" - so he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and never existed in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own life" "", "emphasises hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a person" "", "while staying in water dissolved Nescafe in two cups, it is the holy month Ramadan; this time it is intended for Muslims to fast sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weaknesses to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senseless Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In general, the slump of hot coffee and chwader of Kent cigarette can be found in the nose primarily by freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free heaven, especially when you throw a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"" "" "" "therefore we avoids things to do basic things - as to the public during the Ramadan water - to not land in prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary directors that support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronttsman Hamed Sinno, contradicted the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert is said.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MPs and former pressing of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim to say the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free opinion of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that inquire the approved legitimacy regime in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila reported the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to be decided "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be silky rhetoric, but in fact clearly reflected the crystalline reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib became traditional gender standards by which he formed his vision by the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an evidently, unknown woman, whose arms and legs reach up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of innumerable women who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'Honored' in Jordan has increased - the inofficial outside left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch, according to the number of Honor in 2016, reached its culmination in 2016. however, Jordan was still ongoing that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure for women who tried to support victims of murder or domestic violence to the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the unbreakable control from 1954, women who are subjected to danger of a family authority, "and for their release is often a lonanger bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, even not shy of the subject in his country as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib, however, is that his work is politically, however, is a dream that he can separate his music that is full of explicit announcements on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, a man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "he was confisoned to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words, which one wants, "be faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that there is hardly any one in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily damaged in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn in the context, twisted and had been censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not disagree to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in remembrance today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuerning, who was to work in the eighth century on behalf of the Caliph, why can Jordanians do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hectic kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian News Service adopted several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the grounds that they would have been critical to the issues related to the issues related to the problems with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is an independent gent and take off. Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and indefinite changes. it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions of abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of being able to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will help with music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness, and not by bombs, streuming and on artificial kind. at least, he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">As far as far as it is far, Hdaib will continue to carry further resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman stops as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is also celebrated in many regions in August. another theory states that the Festams, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years, have been invaded by the west of Japan in the North East to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi in the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a couple of great places, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A shared center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fortresses are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and another great way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this history, because they are helping to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and maintain a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where road smoking and illegal drug retailers are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other central and South American countries - rising demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led that more and more normal citizens to the experienced hands of hairdressers can be found.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, taking part of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts assorted each other to show who can be seen from them the excentest Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions) on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the School Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to replace their weapons against hairdresser tools and receive an apprenticeship in hairdressers, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the bietating possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school was offered special educational workshops before the beginning of March, and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because of love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the contribution "love messages to guerrilla steamer," which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel well-cast, affectionate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), young people are encouraged to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute its part: after years of negotiations the Colombian Government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signatories of the Nobel Peace Treaty as important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombian is a long way, until one can talk of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla steamer, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war of war and around the clock their weapons had to be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, had to accustomed to their rows and support them in their rows and support them in construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia must join themselves and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: until now thousands young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerals, which should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was originated on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people whom we love to write thousands of love letters in Valentine's Day, but those who don't need to need to need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told you to share his love with people this year, who needed to the most urgent inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan was to write letters with hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to build up their place in society. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make a discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung BogotArt Foundation in the camp to overtake the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC are based on how they did earlier in order to oppose the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of undertaking people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings can pass through only a few hours - from fear to happiness, and everything that is in between," told the political science student JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having given the letters, a former fighter brought me through the camp of guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerillas live), I saw a guerrilla steamer, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because in addition to him on the bed a mGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in a thorn sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him," "" "hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so nice, therefore I reply to it. I suddenly ran the tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him, and set me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful endangering this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of hunger. "I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how I have to handle with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC arrived in a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">Students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this size, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people hear, which have never seen hearing, and had no electoral law, and that the people who often have seen as a monster, and even hate them that were surrounded by their vitality and the environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the land lives, will hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - also those who have killed and done so much harm to us and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former militants have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been prophesying that after deforestation would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons and to protest against their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology will listen to them - to spread over all those who dreams of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know of your own experience that nothing is simple. that among us who defend lives as the basis of existence, many difficulties are impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke the final end of the hospital in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything together and began to cry.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had taken two jigsaw in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, since my male name stands on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful for him to be respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I was threats to threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They call me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested, sent me to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They created absurd demands: some said me, I have to prove it by the streets running. others wanted me to tell my gender that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have graven-size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole of the Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much, and she put a Strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a flat and just a few hours later, under the window, a car with darkened window disc and a numbering plate with a top 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it was clear that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the numbering signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I want not to give their names, but I want to say that I remember it all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without sign up, without notice, without notice.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you warmest in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know, in which hotel you are using. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove you: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about sexual intercourse, however, this is a tobacco topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional cantonal elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish it, this seatic barriers can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I give me really effort to look like the person they look back from their past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed dortality?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, he was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relative to the problem with the concerned person and at the end a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still pregnant women detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me, there's just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were left out of their relatives to put Kadyrows in judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so you can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As though, these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped to radicalize himself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a guess or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just wanted someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have vanished in this prison after her beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was taken away as these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as a bandits, yet there were no reports so far. we discouraged that these actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not allowed to shave this man to shaving?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and screenings of people who heard a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, which took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003, I was already known in the Great Britain, when I still lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to lead us to" "" "Civilization" "", "but finally we had thrown back into the stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted, I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security Ministry of the Sharia never has a hair cooled down.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">There is a speech in the Chechen language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they are talking about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have her eyes closed before you, because they believed that you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts be?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long, until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about moral over morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but rather above the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Whoever borrowed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I was able to feel the situation in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I am working as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from this, I still worked as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communizers with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, mergers, I donite them to hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I pliers no cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered this people themselves when I climbed up.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's allied.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth that there is no curls.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have those who have the Cabardiner, who also have Russians also. on the whole planet, they are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it's unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims that go into the mosque and during Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transidinity to men who love men, and they believe that one gets to his gender to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trucking connection.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensations to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I become so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I know that I myself am now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of suicide in the poverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months, there is a strong increase of self-mornings.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2403">Once a YouTube tuned video, the moments after he ignited himself, firm.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani Hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi-minority, and activists warn before the spot that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shai Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing together: they were all family fathers, who felt on persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families and go to a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, where most of the Arab people living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to contest the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Anwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and undertook major efforts to finish ethnic autonomy in the whole Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran-coming oil and gas fields as well as some of the most sustainable and valuable areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to remain slow, and the local population receives only little from that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and abdications.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabians in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the waters of Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">This twime have only managed to destroy the devastation in the region, and to destroy local agriculture and fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arabian Ahawzi youth rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Kooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who have completed a work which finished primary school, with 55% of a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethical discrimination," said to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young people.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has got worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic groups and an anti-Arab discrimination in setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions does not plan to set Arab workers to have access to the local Arabian Ahwazi access to all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to make her living outside of their hometown Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their advantages and surnames to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi as even Arabic name at the workplace will not be tolerated because the speaking of the Arabic language or carrying out Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must be able to strike human rights activists before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world is being awake and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I'm not identified with feminism, also with the intersectional part"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the site of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions came out.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am no feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as an internal feminists - with frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand still under stringent observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women grow earlier or later in various areas of life in a glorious ceiling, and that discrimination are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer from double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I am speaking on skin colour, on black Cis women, on black women from the Diaspora, or on black women from the Diaspora, if I mention that kind of feminist, spiritual and verbal have been abused, both in and outside of feminist movement, made many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they are all interested in that women - all women - come together to sing "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing 'to sing equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexual violence, a institutional form of assimildly motivating violence, which we have been exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicity and Heroes are less deserve as white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are more frequently referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spears and women with migration background are subject to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">In one hand, I want to have all men, all males and all men, neither skin colour the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect to the white woman in whose center, the white woman, which refuses to consider both the gender as well as on the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer be struggling to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spy which me and countless other black women always turned down again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In their speech in 1851, Sojourner said in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to justify a ideology in which the black woman is a decent and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to connect me to groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to drive their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I'm not trying to grow white women to be the importance of overcutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to disclose the meaning of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to expose it to better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to settle women from different countries and to limit the white feminism, still the word "Feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I draw it before me to get rid of me full and completely of feminism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as woman in life, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own shows and placed us in the spouses, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism (about: Africa-Womanism) says that we can defend ourselves on our own way, and not only that - black women may be able to provide us in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some of the white and intersectional feminists will immediately claim that they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I've existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm as part of my dark skin and because of my existence as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is not overthrew, nor ignored, nor denied.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurn. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# soft female), which reports against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez said that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, the police have passed and the police said, her statement would be put to the files, but more could not do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was found because of misuse, the aktenant display of Ada BÃ¡ez couldn't be used.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved back its ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The devil's violence against women break is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a display at all, they are generally no support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who misuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit victim to be victims of violence at all in the prosecution's traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content and Statistics 2 Invisible Missing and a legal system that nothing undertaker 3 Paraguayans: good approach, defective implementation of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for comrades on Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General of 9600 ads went on domestic violence. 70% of them went by violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads with the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence against peace dishes. 86% of the ads were born here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">The statistics show however not the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offenders are actually shown. "on every woman who will be refunded to Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana was the strong girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but after that. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she undertook the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe forms:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have been victims of mistreatment once.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read before that, I thought that the only women happen to fall into subjection because they deceive of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook in which they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetoric if he ever made the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they did so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of mistreatments should have at least a certain fellow to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo di Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of mistreatments.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to other information about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental failure.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner was finally able to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias Advertisements for the authorities remained without the result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against their former partner who developed into an infinite legal struggle between Paraguay and her hometown, where it mainly went for money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguayans: good approach, lacking implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of mistreatments is a way of resistors and a fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees large problems in the use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill of bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# FÃ¼rsie).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnamenos movement (# non-Weness) are part of a campaign on Twitter supporting Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law foresees Femizid to explain and harder to explain and tougher as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature has changed in some points to win even the deputies for the law, they were afraid that the way for decriminalization of abortions I become illegal in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cost most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedure which must have the victims of violence at present themselves when they simply receive only display and secure a safe accommodation to state the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means to this place:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a change must take place, so violence is no longer considered to be Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silence in the light of these facts makes himself guilty and wearing that the perpetrators come from.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to leave so long display, until failure is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Act was adopted in the paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law was changed, however, among other things, a passage was cancelled, which called the partner in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggression, once again attack his victims.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the Iranian authorities have closed an independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn due to their coverage over corruption in the Sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and released in court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been reigns since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said who came to power after he had deposed his father, Said ibn Taimur.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the principal offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Chief of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council on Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is carried out with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rare or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the required medical research on site. there are two reasons for a demand in the supply of global healthcare industry, many medicines and vaccines required to cover the special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments in the research of these diseases through pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists themselves being carried out in building their own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for exploring infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first grazing effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later on Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he explored himself on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Furthermore, I start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB, and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only rely on solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always be receiver, instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are encouraged differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or move here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are in your routine research, which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have continuous assistance with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest but only a very limited understanding science methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training starting in any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from being very benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system, that magazines are only accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how to change global food production as "open Source"</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reported about solution for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton chastised lettuce to the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredress, the first plant, which grew from NASA astronauts in space and has been eaten.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Mortar work was only supported by its own objections and the question of how many salads can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more was patented, and that he could not be used to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents have not only been used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been applied to more plants such as cereal or carton imports. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protector, and experts for food safety ensure that of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton denied a salad, however, however, he needs longer, since his work is always worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, as I lie in a river, around which I have to leave." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a split with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents have to go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed more a new salads, because all features have already been patented. "he makes it so good as possible and tries to appoint those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He is also connected to a movement that is always getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have farmed red RÃ¶mersalat the variety of Outredoms in the "glasshouse" station and eaten. there will be tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name is rather so sounds as if the movement from the IT range originate and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by movement for free "open Source" software to inspire the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was set up in order to ensure that some plant species and gene are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can also undertake that others can use seed freely from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can do with their seed do not continue to do business and selling it. "open Source" breeders allow only others who purchase seeds to breed, and not to be able to send their own varieties - two aspects which were banned or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Rough prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeral professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays with him a role in major merge such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by using seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who wants to buy food, locally and sustainable produced vegetables, such as it is being offered on farms markets, should also know that the way is being bred, such as this vegetables is farmed.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritious levels without seeds in high quality is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the open source Seed initiative are committed to provide other seed remains free of charge. in contrast, their anticipation is to be patented, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk since the available Genopool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, inablishment.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, president of the Ossi, engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all carton features are protected as intellectual property, making it possible for plant breeders either not or worth it.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates exist not yet, but experts like Luby means that massaging plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sight</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted characteristics - from such as their taste or their color improves up to such as they grow in certain environments and withstand threats like pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are constantly decreasing by more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before, because the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property will promote other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant variations" innovation. "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often this instructions help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection, i.e., does not support innovations, but promotes to public more material and know-how to be provided. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long, to breed plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one could have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument of Morton, however, is that genetic resources always have been a general public and remain still to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what happened to us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton interfered on the concept to patroning plant characteristics:" "" "we do not create the features themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them themselves and as breeders, we do not have any idea how to do the plants.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breeding a variety can also breed his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in the industrial agriculture with great farms and monocultures, are needed for the cultivation of herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is obvious. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they are able to survive the most smaller seed companies - either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the fact that breeders would be innovative through the Avoid of plant patters of innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new than the company, the patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years, "he says." with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, to make it easy for my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seem to be a leader in the "open Source" breeding, the concept spreads very quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") is a "open-source" seed program. on receipt of the seed of traditional bucks, the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agreements works on an "open-source" license which ultimately resulted in a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeding differ from country to country, due to the Ossi obligation not just one can be taken one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally, conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards paternity of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "open source" seed systems, states that the organization is currently preparing a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems, which should fall next year of the official start date.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government closed the site of the "Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) that documents human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised the Egyptian authorities for this stage and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The original Network for Human Rights Information has been abstained, despite this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution. even though it was never so difficult to follow these goals and to follow victims in the Arab world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI was never so important as now. ANHRI was never so important to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome the sperm and do not follow. we hope to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent News page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking edition of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st human rights organisation of the wave of web pages like victims. @ anhri have one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt's blog of the columnists and human rights research group Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columnies and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog which he set up in order to handle the censurion of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is home to the Ziadas blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article relate mainly to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed a blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blown of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is because of two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It happened to them to mediate in the sense of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the sperm blogs, as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have demonstrated that I did not wrote in vain. in other words: my words have an influence if you only have a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have closed him and, that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go to the end up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24th May to 6th of August 133 websites. this included technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by changing Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we realized how the locking of websites used by VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is wormert that the ignition decisions have closed behind closed doors, reducing the Egyptian population does not have legal basis, with which they can proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school" every second day a police officer murdered in Rio de Janeiro, "" "" thieves's chemist's military weapons "" "," President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air forces to Rio. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio well-known newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "on August 16th the motto" "" "This is not normal," "" "in which they announced, a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision stated:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes committed in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual behavior, etc. everything that happens to the civilised standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the "War" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we do not exclude our eyes in front of the crueliness.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was dealt on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, announced that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explains that according to data of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used, atrocities of the police, who do not shoot and ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than it used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira to describe the violence as "war." this is in their opinion after a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to make responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - like extra in the analysis of the military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in staff, education and a historical and self-adhesive neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just his capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">At the beginning, this did actually lead to a decrease in violent deaths. since several years, the UPP was able to protect the UPP after several reports about shicans and repression against poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, and increasingly under coating.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his article in 2010, which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also attracts serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Because this requires the state to use, means and ways to use the typical for a war. this is the penetrating into the territory of a "enemy ', with which a civil is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for" collateral damages "and" irreversible balls. "</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we mounted nylon in front of the open window, so that we don't swim at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made it ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church which was twice a day food twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Indeed, Italy is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seekers. it's true, however, that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country is disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "specific recording centers" in the hands of improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel.</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can then be allocated to a recording center if they officially put an application for asylum -which can still go for months after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it came to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his innocent life helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years of work in construction industry for several years, Asharaf stirred his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well, that he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghanistan developed companies, including cutting groups, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiter and the kitchen personnel are mainly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims, however, extend far beyond the Italian gastronomic industries and the retail, and aim to the country that he had to leave the country as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happy when I know my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>

<seg id="2932">The Egyptian Parliament has reviewed a draft bill, which stipulates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to use to use the social networks within six months of successful lawsuit in the website of the authority under specifying the full name and their identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who have missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the processing committee as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of a member of the legislature filed a lawsuit in which harsher penalties for the president or a high civil servants would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the Egyptian right the insist of the President as well as government agencies have already been punishable. however, under the law there would be such a case with prison and fines, as right-wing of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is supposed to be approved, this could mean until three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would also undertake a political climate, in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom was already in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud plan Zid (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers to demonstrate violence against demonstrators who led to the military coup that led to the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison on a court.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed until the 20th May, because the prison for human rights groups failed to bring the defendants from prison to the court of jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups include arms, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>

<seg id="2949">That was published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat's website, creates a light to look like the predefined plans for the support of the legislature.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia reaffirmed the naming of its sources under article 11 of the Tunisian press association, which reporters the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, in Tunis, he joined the Tunis Regional Court in Tunis on 9 May.</seg>

<seg id="2962">These websites include websites like Vcontacted and Odnoclassic niki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service email .ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
