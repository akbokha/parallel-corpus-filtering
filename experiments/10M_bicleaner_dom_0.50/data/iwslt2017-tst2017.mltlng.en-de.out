this is James R@@ isen .
they perhaps know him because he won as New York Times reporter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the N@@ SA had illegal Telef@@ one of Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is another chapter that left a lasting impression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation in which the CIA was literally translated into a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know what the chapter is not pleased ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government was determined against r@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the patterns of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and journalists journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen , they budget .
so , as the government near R@@ isen , he did something like many cour@@ age@@ ous reporter already did before him : he refused and said he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was still living with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , although they were not important for their fall , the government &apos;s demands were dropped by government .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failure and inst@@ ants to make statements , this also could do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , wor@@ ried , wor@@ ried ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel agent with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ ck .
unfortunately , this is one of many cases .
President Obama spoke to his appeal to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead , justice won more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how to be a problem , especially because the government is too much involved in their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result that W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist .
so , we put the press coverage to the game that is protected by the first constitutional provisions , because the government has always more possibilities to spread out all .
but the same as technology is allowed to handle the rights of rep@@ tiles , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they can hold it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ math .
today , there are communication software that has not been written as inst@@ ants his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source application system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer that was originally developed by the Internet , which was developed by us to Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working there .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , such as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government does not support more information secretly , and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available from advance .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments have always been developing new spy technologies for all over the world .
it is possible to ensure that not only technology ken@@ ner like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to get ini@@ quities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
the above abuse during the supply of soldiers might be modest and reported by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm suggests to the si@@ gh of water by F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider who warns us in front of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime , but to protect our rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data collection of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge money sum@@ s have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; We asked by news about a l@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca Hotels in Panama .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will receive an impression how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you register this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to first very direct consequences .
Iceland Islands Prime Minister has resigned .
there are also reports that a ban of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad was station@@ ed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia is President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , one of the famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , waiting for the next release , and to the next release documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency containing a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM .
it seems aw@@ es away from you , to me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , it means that less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , their assets to hide and rep@@ ay@@ ing -- some that we have been discus@@ sing and un@@ veil us for ten years .
I think many people will appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ ils work .
I always put it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these things .
it can be very difficult for tra@@ ce@@ ability and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is .
I think it is interesting that in the USA there are fewer reports about this matter .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that previously appeared in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
however , by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ ils work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data collection of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we &apos;d see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA .
in fact , it is such that one needs fewer information in some US states to get less information to get a company than in order to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts , school children .
it allows concrete to remove particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as African ministers who wanted to bring susp@@ ect money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really sho@@ cked us that all of us to a lawyer from investig@@ ating proposals , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ sidents . none of these lawyers took us as a client@@ ele , and of course nothing was handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who spread our covered investigations .
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , wound in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability shall be established .
and to overcome this , we need to change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behavior .
this may be all very tr@@ asp@@ ing , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing has changed ever ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a native optim@@ ist , I think that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen pre@@ vent@@ ures to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU in central regi@@ sters have been recorded at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US hin@@ der here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we &apos;d like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens , as funds is used to provide more transparency to the US and global for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who can recognize and use the problem through the laws of in@@ transparent .
together we can finally end this type of control , corruption and money la@@ undering , we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ farm sale .
one type in the red Maz@@ da remained and saw my stuff looked at .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip to the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to leave the Maz@@ das of a Maz@@ das !
that is a small boot space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Look , how please ? &quot;
at night , I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken myself ?
a wild sleep in my living room .
what if it &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , ti@@ lt at the door , and my sleep door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the work of art , which he bought from me , depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
that was my first experience as host . it has changed my viewing angle completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
it was normal for me when I moved to San Francisco . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air rat .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws up and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked .
I think creativity is able to create anxiety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow occup@@ ants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment will stay on a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; Air@@ mat@@ rat and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ts completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . as we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I joined us .
did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we would like to create a website on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the type of rooms , whose doors includes , when you come over .
on the Internet , you can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missile would be ign@@ ited .
but did not do it .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that makes strangers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned as children , that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can find on the things you can . we were able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to build objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between humans who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a taste , which degrees trust we stum@@ bled .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your order .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now , I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone on your left seat .
this quiet trip from panic , which you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked number of strangers in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they can sleep differently .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just like this , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you declare on Twitter for the president of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence should we want to build . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a little detail at this experiment ?
what if your neighbor has been introduced only once with his name ; if he had told how he does , how his dog or his children are called ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine , they had 150 convic@@ tions , which all say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he really can hold fast cell phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you want to give your mobile phone ?
because a good feedback system strengthens trust is decisive .
at the beginning , we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to settle negative conditions .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest submitted their findings , before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are at age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social code .
it will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of ass@@ ess@@ ments .
if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we drove that trust depends on how much you are affordable .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells too little , as for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he tells you much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle art in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to make this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces to strangers .
by what we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : unbelievable good luck .
second : the un@@ ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
the business is just very good for us .
of course , there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ allowed parties to be celebrated or apartments .
we have hosts guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . I &apos;m doing so if I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment , which one hears in the voice of the voice , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve ourselves .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there was only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays .
for people confi@@ ded to each other .
when confidence is working , won@@ dro@@ us works might be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra is real protection level that save one life , even though they do not know anything .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they do not want that one feels lon@@ ely , they bring books .
you can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , of course doesn &apos;t work every stay .
but these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of part with money actions fit together ?
it &apos;s about a economic trade .
but now it is simply called the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter will not be justified .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what would you be if travelling a rich buffet from local integration ?
what if at any place to visit a group there would be waiting to fill a group there , and show a bar to a bar of a bar , of which one has never heard .
or if you could cooking a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design flats of the ground up to the shared ?
what would that look like ?
what would be if cities would have received the idea of common shares ?
I ask myself cities that allow us company and relations , instead of in@@ sol@@ itude and imp@@ ot@@ ation .
this project started in South Korea in Seoul , and many parking lots covered by the government ,
the inhabitants have been offered . students who were looking for a stay in search of a lead ,
were medi@@ ated by people whose children were pulled out . In@@ cub@@ ator has been launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , today night alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a fore@@ igner or even hosts .
so the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was taught .
we have not invented the wheel .
hospitality gave it even before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has just our works ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ root parts .
I think that &apos;s amazing ,
just overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes by me .
we know of course that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the coming soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a faithful ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ wear a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or simply delay a delay at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so , the media represent people like I like .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most would not know any Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to know you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am tired ,
a se@@ al@@ eg@@ rowing fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual muscle .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage .
my femin@@ ist gir@@ l@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the lucky person was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , as opposed to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old feeling me to adapt to a perfect and imm@@ atur@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought , turned into question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dev@@ otion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k sometimes brings me to weeping .
I know myself . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever get the feeling that somebody takes you , you complete , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering .
I was later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , at the end was breakfast , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Express &quot; . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ends from the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into indignation .
why should I do something like that ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; Ab@@ i ... , ... &quot; bom@@ ber Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
it wasn &apos;t only my country , but in the N@@ u related me the deeds of others from one citizen to a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we knew me -- so deep it went into my seat square , and I feared the first time to be recognized as mus@@ lim@@ in .
we moved into our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard , I read and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t lead you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather in prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of this .
the emotions were understand@@ ably , and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people who were for Muslims arrested and struck for Muslims .
there was really bran@@ ded tips on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt really felt right .
because people who attacked this land attacked our country .
I have hum@@ bled the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it &apos;s not easy to explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
the accus@@ ations , which are hard .
today we can say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims join and close Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US .
the question arises : are we mal@@ icious or really good ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be removed as a whole , and a goo@@ d@@ ess tum@@ ours only under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ator and Olympic statistics .
is the closure of Mos@@ ques America safer ?
perhaps there will be a few parking spaces , but do not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and larger participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people will actually be radic@@ alized in Mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
at the radical process , it is found that it begins online . as a result , the person of their church can be cut off , even from their family that the extre@@ mi@@ lion may cause a cer@@ eb@@ ral wash that the person may believe that the terrorists will abh@@ ors the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ide@@ ology , is a betra@@ y@@ ter or fallen from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must keep the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS is their brut@@ ality with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
as a nut@@ me@@ in , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS .
but we would then add to the world , if one recogni@@ zes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you throw up a look at them , they do not drive them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality who lets them read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me about an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she asked to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she brought her silence , and told her , her wrath , her meaning for the un@@ righteousness in the world , that it might only be in trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their anger , she was a main goal for the instr@@ ument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who responded a solution .
this image turned the link to God and their church again .
rather than acc@@ using it for their anger , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept them to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on any other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear of fear every day on our democracy ?
a study - actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear us , pass at least three things .
we accept more a authorized government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you report Test@@ ed news , in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the atmosphere against Muslims pushed forward - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never related to terrorist attacks .
it was in the run of the war of Iraq and during two election periods .
so the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation to the public to under@@ stands the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear sho@@ ok us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not only to explain himself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the most beautiful , most generous person who knew it .
she visited him there and he showed her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when did you become such a reversible young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne , her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , who was murdered in the afternoon , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in their apartment , as in one execution , after he had post@@ oper@@ atively directed against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home ?
we discuss it and for us it was not a slight decision , because we would like to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we decided to build us for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we were silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , when my shoes went out , went into the pit Hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely drunk .
then the im@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests welcome , as the half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to teach us .
in this moment I am collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and alleg@@ ations .
what will you choose ?
what are you going to choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you be sure to go on number ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than those who are .
thank you so much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say that you think that you &apos;re holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a den@@ cian with deep dive , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual , as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did it with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want to normal people .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any case .
if people appear as a rule , then the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is a billi@@ ard business shortly before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air flow in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six @-@ metre tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting , flight tools achieve high speed and acceleration in the closest space .
you can also build self @-@ load structures .
they have lear@@ nt to carry loads to deal with Tur@@ bul@@ ences and in general to react on natural laws .
today we want to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible autonomous flight .
in order to work a system autonomous , it has to know collective labelling , where space are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new locomotive technology for Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available in the highest image , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an airplane , that tries to beat two flying with a cap .
like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the wings , it can ho@@ ver , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a kiss .
a limitation of rear @-@ rigid is that they respond sensitive to turbul@@ ences such as wind bows .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered , and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing .
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often ask the fundamental abstract questions that occurred to the core of the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller scale moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known to be known as machines with a thousand movable parts that can be sent to viol@@ ate you .
for decades ago , pilots were able to fly air@@ planes flying , which only had two mot@@ ions : a propeller and a rear ru@@ der .
we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the monster , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est control unit . it was invented in front of recently .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no g@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ ps , no other drives or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechan@@ ically , happens in the inner life much , so it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to fly it to fly , I have to throw it just right .
the probability of throwing it exactly if all of me is slim , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the monster is a practice in gen@@ ius , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this flow ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
this is why he is equivalent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the ability of the ability to
in the room to move in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propeller .
a lot is possible in models , the rest is learned directly at flies .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers prop@@ ellers .
this revol@@ ves clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a bit wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if even restricted .
we will now demonstrate this , making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ warming .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a pal@@ let of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alized technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , please do this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to practice a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types such as us lies the wages in the development and the work act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart skill to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential , the bag is on the i .
thank you so much .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were moving together in a very far away galaxy , they walked so the mass three times in a tenth piece in pure energy .
for this short moment they lighten@@ ed brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the universe .
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
but they put them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time in@@ feed itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we re@@ arrange the events of time .
1.3 billion years ago , most of the living life was made on Earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : coral , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God arise with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , which arise about col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a crazy genre , so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the L@@ IG@@ O Det@@ ector : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ri@@ o @-@ Observatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could be significantly increased , which improved the detection performance .
therefore we call him Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some minor , hard @-@ hard problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye from my father &apos;s father .
basically , we were the fruits of my life .
all this I &apos;ve worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black d@@ holes and their ob@@ servatory such as L@@ IG@@ O meas@@ ur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ation waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cro@@ wning in the feed of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched towards a direction and put into the other .
for illustr@@ ative lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity is often a true al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even sm@@ iling , are ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched out the waves of the waves and the strain of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the coming , followed by a 1 . therefore the L@@ IG@@ O employees declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is absurd , this length should be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear @-@ core . this is gra@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for waves in the way : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are tremendous .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O be more than one eye than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ ial features , the size of your cell phones .
that &apos;s quite convenient . for example , you can just@@ ify a picture or a map of things by taking the light of several points of the light around you .
near sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things , which mean you very much :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to specific characteristics such as clay position and height , rhythm and volume to close behind the history behind .
&quot; now Alice is talking about . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can &apos;t make them easy pictures of objects in all .
however , having regard to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to us their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can hear the all literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation too no@@ isy , it can betra@@ y us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes which my colleague Scott employs a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotation holes , cir@@ cu@@ res simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cu@@ res with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement rate , shaped like the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der Ger@@ minal &#93; J@@ one who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 times sun mass , which will turn around as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker .
AA : we are superior to what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
this is the permanent importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to exploring the universe as they never had previously possible .
on this way we can listen to the space and listen to the invisible .
we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- practical or basically .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the space .
but the thr@@ illing physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , because these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . I would like to search out the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is conce@@ aled by his own night .
using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimi@@ stic , that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , L@@ IG@@ O found the same in the first run of things , which we did not expect .
my colleague on MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars , which produce black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so called the sc@@ r@@ ting kno@@ cking for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O allows us to give us a completely different angle of view to the events of the stars and ultimately , as we also emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and the noise of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ oria -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ oria on Earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
one year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; to say before I was afraid .
no matter if it made me nervous , I brought me to say &quot; Yes &quot; to say .
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live in television ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the game ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my fear , to keep words , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an un@@ expect@@ edly art . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , har@@ p , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the Klein@@ ste , is called all the &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; reasons ,
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estim@@ ation , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ mol@@ asses . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her , when I was straight on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ars to play with them once you &apos;re doing to me . no matter what I am doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I try it very much .
it has a magic effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a dis@@ appo@@ inting effect : only recently , I was completely understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; ages for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things from , stir up the life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I producer television .
I make TVs , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for that 70 hours of program carry out the world .
four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that are not exist@@ ent before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days , four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollar TV , four TV programs , four TV channels , three episodes that are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my television series are running succ@@ essively on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I create itself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ ese . I must find time , truly st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans into the camp fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that round the world .
do you know who is still doing ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ press that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who are so hard to work if you &apos;re talking about a company , a country or a household to make me serious , so that I &apos;m not just around the computer , and it &apos;s true if I say : I understand that there is no dream with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I turned troops , I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a dre@@ aming of a high tone , you &apos;d like a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ uous , funny and anno@@ ying , so@@ da and reasonable , cruel and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when the work runs well .
a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy road , I could always go on her .
many people assume , if I say to them the sum@@ s that I am persu@@ aded writing that writing is pleasure to me .
don &apos;t understand me , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I started working with the television production , when I began to work and work , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than that writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot stri@@ ve differently than to size .
the feeling , not to be different , than to stri@@ ve to size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ men .
or maybe it also means to be an workflow .
maybe it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not made for the failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it in question .
to make a clear thing : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more details , the more things at the same time , the more things you see , the more things I write about history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then stopped the sum@@ s .
revised , rev@@ oked , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burned .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single job .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ation , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium .
they are baby titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , did not work weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , don &apos;t sleep , don &apos;t give up , with all your heart , clear eyes what also always .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do if that , what you do , the work that you love to love suddenly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you look , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author of the author . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re going to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker who knows to be a teacher , a painter who knows the sum@@ s , and knows how to stop the sum@@ s if the sum@@ s stopped , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
still I &apos;m a Titan ?
when the song heard my heart , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; presents me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will tell no one more than two things :
first , I must say Yes to all and second , she called me not &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ations . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I pack it if I am Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special about it .
we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ s , can I do nothing unless fit out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists , stick@@ y fingers and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , juni@@ per tip and the song in which it goes to lot , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; are extingu@@ ished .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
not a full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel as I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium box , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you if I say you who I am , if I do by using programs and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the stream , which comes from life lust .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s ignored the pressure of the history to do the anticip@@ ation , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed to God the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me I will say Yes .
I do this as a solid rule , so I can liber@@ ate myself as a work@@ horse of any debt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I do not have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play is not an@@ sat@@ a so as to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer my job as a home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , for what kind of man does better than to be home ?
well , I am .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too hard , none of them .
we tur@@ f around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mostly sti@@ ff@@ ly , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always g@@ onna go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe met me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we stopped working with the games ?
you can also say it ! always say Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
perhaps you hold me for na@@ ive , for a day@@ dream .
you are well doing , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child takes you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
I speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes to the piece , even on a bad @-@ mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no linen change .
the day is short : dinner , the children under@@ go .
but there are 15 minutes in it !
my children are my well @-@ feeling , my world . it must not be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure ,
to the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
g@@ lowing yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m missing and I &apos;ll meet friends , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass a titanium in the training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
works not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door open to the energy and I find me again in my office . I hear an unknown melody that fills me and my soul . they lead me into new ideas . I &apos;ll use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not I ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
now this is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grat@@ eful for that .
it &apos;s nice to me that I am a Titan . I never saw a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have all in the grip . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I am working .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the tro@@ users , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the others , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more me !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I stir you up to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
titanium have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very small ability to self @-@ support .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
sure they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ bach stim@@ ulation . &quot; there is im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons , that improves neuro@@ logic function .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered under heavy trem@@ bling and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was senior keeper and worked in the emergency recording day and night .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a s@@ welling and the skull @-@ pressure is incl@@ ined at skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull @-@ printing pressure .
you sometimes need to remove a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
cells from a tissue is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families .
you must find the correct diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François @-@ François
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looks exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the biological classes that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has tri@@ bal cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks she died even .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like the stem cells , but it was different .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ral cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fo@@ etus stage , they provide the f@@ ading of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we found it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but that is not so sure .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark color in order to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the end of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in a damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken again , they go back home . the room is already busy , they are not used there , so do they van@@ ish .
in the second scenario , we had a violation of and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remain - they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these little points . these are the cells that we paint in vitro in the culture .
we could not stop here .
will these cells be able to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual dex@@ ter@@ istic task .
they had to take animal pellets for a tablet .
they made them very well .
when they had achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ istic level , we last year in the mot@@ orized Cort@@ ex the hand@@ mot@@ ic area .
then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands .
exactly as it would happen with people , it re@@ covers spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , exactly as after a stroke .
the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms . they are re@@ covering to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side , you can see the monkey that recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original capacity prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after friction .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use them freezing and later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ min@@ ate it in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself .
thank you so much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who needs that . &quot;
I definitely like .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results , you have to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to look at the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and these therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you told us about it .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
we are doing a big bug in the West as of course .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant , which it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable cent@@ en@@ ity .
we believe capitalism does not lead to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great after@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a flo@@ wering capitalism and impressive growth , while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , the democracy goes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect au@@ sterity programmes that were realised in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my persu@@ asive friends who would have repeated me if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you together with me again , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ icient democracy .
because without democracy , our societies are common in common , our future dark and our great , new technologies .
on the topic of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened by our ta@@ vern@@ s .
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the Scho@@ den@@ berg , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Scho@@ den@@ berg ,
but few can recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which have the ver@@ ge au@@ sterity and corporations that could be too fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest where it would be productive and income could produce and also all those things could produce that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in the United States , in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial facilities , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on .
it is worth 3.4 trillion dollars after a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except for stock ex@@ cre@@ ws and the real estate prices .
in this way , debts and un@@ productive capital make the twins summit which did not exceed the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low demand for investors which could not invest in which they could not invest . exactly as O@@ be@@ pus Father , who is of fear that would kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ wanted to cause the circumstances that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my Ha@@ des with capitalism --
its extremely severe capital . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , improving human talents , and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed , what do we understand among democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the board form , in which the Free and the poor as a majority rule the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has of course too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these cl@@ as@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave them the working arms , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but important and decisive , which they viol@@ ated them the right to political participation with the same mood in questions of the stat@@ ute &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy didn &apos;t have held a long time --
like a candle that lights up very bright , it is also burned quickly .
but our today liberal democracy did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling leaders .
because the liberal democracy did not occur when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible , and the democratic process was transferred to politics while the economy -- thus the world of companies -- a demo@@ cra@@ y@@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time in which the separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ inher@@ ent battle between the two and the economy gradually mig@@ rated the politics and deci@@ de@@ fies it .
do you wonders , why the politicians are not so much more like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it lies that today it can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics in the economy is divided and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ pen with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of smokers that are so sustainable the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they were star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far can@@ ni@@ fied by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of the corporations increases , political goods is increasing , the economic demand is rising , and the managing director of the corporations are too fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest the cash of their enterprise .
the more successful of capitalism sells the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twins summit , and the more the waste of human labour power and the wealth of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ join the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
Inci@@ dentally , this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not especially good .
the doctrine from Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms were able to recover a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it , replacing low @-@ glo@@ om , through automation and robots .
the problem is that long economy and policy are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste offering , and the social conflicts deeper than it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must unite the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics , and insi@@ sting that we will be democr@@ at@@ ted to the unified field , otherwise we will show the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not , whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is through a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to those in &quot; matrix , &quot; or resem@@ bles the people living in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or put human energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks with the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to tell you in all , some examples .
in the field of companies : ask yourself a capital market , while you are working and in which your capital gains you from one office to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and from generating and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no differentiation between those who belong to the company , but they do not work therein , and employees working there , but the company doesn &apos;t belong to capital and work , no big g@@ aps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no continuous twins summit .
in the area of global political economy : please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trading of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment agents are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in front of the background of a recovered politics and business .
the world that I ask you is liber@@ ate , in which they were privileged to privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , there is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we fall into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to join us together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you are in your biography itself as the liberal Mar@@ xi@@ est .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s Analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do this , the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
likewise as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am entirely des@@ i@@ ded .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work it is not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture mentioned you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Red@@ ner you have very clearly said what you keep from the vision of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the state of democracy .
as I said in my lecture we have limited democracy to politics , during the area where most of them plays , -- the area of the economy -- a totally demo@@ cra@@ y@@ free zone .
in a certain way , if I may say the pro@@ voc@@ ative that China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
because -- do you remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy - that &apos;s a mistake .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now trying to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells massive to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent re@@ dness that proce@@ eded by the Eurozone , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek fore@@ word -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion , who revealed this den@@ ial --
sorry . unfortunately , power within the euro zone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ying the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you &apos;re trying to get a economic system that is not over@@ viable , by political will and author mil@@ itar@@ ism , you may take a while there may be a while , but if the shift occurs , it passes ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future when we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back - Harvest ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , after 6 months in office , particularly in a so called situation , he claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the training program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money la@@ vers to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they wanted to bring only our government but only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the fraud that ran through the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to stand up for a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who raised this policy , said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive pon@@ ons of talks , you seem to be right per European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they don &apos;t survive , the released fli@@ ckers will be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe , but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we introduce ourselves to the way of a postcard in 1930 , then it will be appearing to me as well as the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope to be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard even though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision , the Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fighting industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select anything .
he must find shows , very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this corner .
this curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received .
if your show is rated by nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &apos; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive after you saw a season , your brain : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left hand , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough , that goes down at this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you already need special intelligence to under@@ offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he turns out more thoughts on average expul@@ sion , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad , they do not insp@@ ire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so doing something , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want anything risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses with an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and re@@ stores them online , where they can watch each free of charge .
and if Amazon is for free things , you &apos;re going to attack , right ?
millions of spectators look at this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watched at watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that all of them are recording .
you record when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts can be ski@@ pping or looked again .
you will collect millions of data to choose from these data , which show them to produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and it gives the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Senate . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- thus something above average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company , another manager gives a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for making this a super show , but he also uses data for it , but it makes it something different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find these little details about the viewers : which shows they like the producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a venture and decided to do not a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,1 evaluation on this curve . so , where they wanted .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data reversible companies .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision , which one should meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the most important thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we are living more and more about statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company &apos;s Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if anyone is here in the US in prison and asking for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , it can be very bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . this is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems do not know how to use data .
the data must also be in@@ correct .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is fore@@ seen by data analysis of influenza , the worst kind , predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfect , year around year , until it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the release of the release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all of these errors , data must come down in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in case of legal proceedings , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer treatment
or the development of any drug . over the years I recognized some patterns using the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissem@@ inated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you do mainly do two things :
as a result , you have to analyze this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second place you put the parts again to deal with a dis@@ claim@@ er .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to cut a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ comp@@ ose the parts and then come to an end .
there is another tool and we own it all : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
you can use data to understand their audience better , what else could it be . but the decision to put together all these parts , again put together a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that stood not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they went to a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things are going wrong , when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and in order to forget that this device is pretty useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions with a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you will only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will get it later with a technique demo .
so far I met some decisions in my life , where I should listen to the ball in the night .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better choices .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and wis@@ er . finally , it is on us to meet decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays out to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks to enter .
by the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you beautiful .
