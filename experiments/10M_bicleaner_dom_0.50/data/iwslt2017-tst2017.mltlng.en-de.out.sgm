<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They perhaps know him because he won as New York Times reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA had illegal Telefone of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "but there is another chapter that left a lasting impression." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA was literally translated into a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know what the chapter is not pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government was determined against risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the patterns of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the Mutigen, they budget.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, as the government near Risen, he did something like many courageous reporter already did before him: he refused and said he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was still living with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were not important for their fall, the government's demands were dropped by government.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and instants to make statements, this also could do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, worried, worried,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel agent with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke to his appeal to protect Whistleblower. but instead, justice won more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how to be a problem, especially because the government is too much involved in their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result that Whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the press coverage to the game that is protected by the first constitutional provisions, because the government has always more possibilities to spread out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But the same as technology is allowed to handle the rights of reptiles, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can hold it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that has not been written as instants his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source application system for Whistleblower that was originally developed by the Internet, which was developed by us to Aaron Swartz, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working there.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government does not support more information secretly, and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments have always been developing new spy technologies for all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is possible to ensure that not only technology kenner like Edward Snowden have a possibility to get iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The above abuse during the supply of soldiers might be modest and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm suggests to the sigh of water by Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warns us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime, but to protect our rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data collection of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that the rich and powerful] [huge money sums have been hidden in tax havases.] [what does that mean?] [We asked by news about a leck of 11 million documents of the Mosque Fonseca Hotels in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you register this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ban of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad was stationed companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia is President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, one of the famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, waiting for the next release, and to the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency containing a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems awes away from you, to me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, it means that less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, their assets to hide and repaying -- some that we have been discussing and unveil us for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will appear very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax hails work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a Matrjoschuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these things.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for traceability and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that in the USA there are fewer reports about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that previously appeared in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle, after which these tax hails work, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data collection of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we'd see much more cases and examples that have connections in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is such that one needs fewer information in some US states to get less information to get a company than in order to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It allows concrete to remove particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 attorneys in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as African ministers who wanted to bring suspect money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of us to a lawyer from investigating proposals, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all presidents. none of these lawyers took us as a clientele, and of course nothing was handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who spread our covered investigations.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politiker, wound in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, by corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability shall be established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may be all very trasping, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing has changed ever; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimist, I think that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen preventures to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU in central registers have been recorded at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US hinder here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we'd like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of the tax havens, as funds is used to provide more transparency to the US and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who can recognize and use the problem through the laws of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end this type of control, corruption and money laundering, we can finally end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost abducted and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backfarm sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">One type in the red Mazda remained and saw my stuff looked at.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip to the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to leave the Mazdas of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That is a small boot space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Look, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night, I was in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, tilt at the door, and my sleep door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as host. it has changed my viewing angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">It was normal for me when I moved to San Francisco. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air rat.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate draws up and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity is able to create anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow occupants Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment will stay on a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "Airmatrat and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floor for 20 dollars on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure to decorate our cheese ham Omelts completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. as we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we would like to create a website on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the type of rooms, whose doors includes, when you come over.</seg>
<seg id="139">On the Internet, you can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that makes strangers allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children, that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can find on the things you can. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to build objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between humans who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste, which degrees trust we stumbled.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your order.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet trip from panic, which you will feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked number of strangers in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they can sleep differently.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like this, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you declare on Twitter for the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence should we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor has been introduced only once with his name; if he had told how he does, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "imagine, they had 150 convictions, which all say:" "" "he really can hold fast cell phones!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you want to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a good feedback system strengthens trust is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to settle negative conditions.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest submitted their findings, before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social code.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that trust depends on how much you are affordable.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, as for example, "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "he tells you much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle art in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">By what we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to place these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is just very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unallowed parties to be celebrated or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">We have hosts guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all phone calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. I'm doing so if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment, which one hears in the voice of the voice, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, there was only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence is working, wondrous works might be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra is real protection level that save one life, even though they do not know anything.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want that one feels lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, of course doesn't work every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money actions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it is simply called the "rental industry," the matter will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would you be if travelling a rich buffet from local integration?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place to visit a group there would be waiting to fill a group there, and show a bar to a bar of a bar, of which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cooking a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are arranged according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design flats of the ground up to the shared?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would be if cities would have received the idea of common shares?</seg>
<seg id="238">I ask myself cities that allow us company and relations, instead of insolitude and impotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project started in South Korea in Seoul, and many parking lots covered by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">The inhabitants have been offered. students who were looking for a stay in search of a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated by people whose children were pulled out. Incubator has been launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, today night alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreigner or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy, as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality gave it even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep-root parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda goes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the coming soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, underwear a brain underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay a delay at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media represent people like I like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to know you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am tired,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealegrowing fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual muscle.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head coverage.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The lucky person was: at that time, it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, as opposed to the pressure that I felt as a 17-year-old feeling me to adapt to a perfect and immaturable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, turned into question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik sometimes brings me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever get the feeling that somebody takes you, you complete, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, at the end was breakfast, looked on the screen and saw the word "Express". "</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spends from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"...,... in the name of Islam...,... "Abi...,..." bomber Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It wasn't only my country, but in the Nu related me the deeds of others from one citizen to a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we knew me -- so deep it went into my seat square, and I feared the first time to be recognized as muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard, I read and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be careful," "" "Don't be careful," "" "I don't lead you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather in prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of this.</seg>
<seg id="310">The emotions were understandably, and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people who were for Muslims arrested and struck for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really branded tips on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this land attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have humbled the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It's not easy to explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">The accusations, which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we loose them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims join and close Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malicious or really good?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole, and a goodess tumours only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, educator and Olympic statistics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Is the closure of Mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps there will be a few parking spaces, but do not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and larger participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people will actually be radicalized in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the radical process, it is found that it begins online. as a result, the person of their church can be cut off, even from their family that the extremilion may cause a cerebral wash that the person may believe that the terrorists will abhors the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology, is a betrayter or fallen from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must keep the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS is their brutality with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a nutmein, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would then add to the world, if one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw up a look at them, they do not drive them what they are in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality who lets them read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me about an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she asked to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, she brought her silence, and told her, her wrath, her meaning for the unrighteousness in the world, that it might only be in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that would have been given to their anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who responded a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This image turned the link to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accusing it for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear of fear every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study - actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear us, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept more a authorized government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you report Tested news, in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the atmosphere against Muslims pushed forward - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never related to terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in the run of the war of Iraq and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So the Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation to the public to understands the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear shook us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not only to explain himself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the most beautiful, most generous person who knew it.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her curriculum. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did you become such a reversible young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, who was murdered in the afternoon, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in their apartment, as in one execution, after he had postoperatively directed against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discuss it and for us it was not a slight decision, because we would like to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely practise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to build us for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we were silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, when my shoes went out, went into the pit Hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely drunk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the imm made an announcement, thanked and called our guests welcome, as the half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to teach us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion on panic and allegations.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you going to choose in the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that mean: we are better than those who are.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you think that you're holding a TEDTalk, a dencian with deep dive, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usual, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did it with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want to normal people.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any case.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, is a billiard business shortly before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air flow in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft machines at the Frac Centre in France was built live in front of the audience a six-metre tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flight tools achieve high speed and acceleration in the closest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-load structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learnt to carry loads to deal with Turbulences and in general to react on natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work a system autonomous, it has to know collective labelling, where space are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new locomotive technology for Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available in the highest image, e.g." "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An airplane, that tries to beat two flying with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the wings, it can hover, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a kiss.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-rigid is that they respond sensitive to turbulences such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered, and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "" "" "during our research, we often ask the fundamental abstract questions that occurred to the core of the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller scale moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known to be known as machines with a thousand movable parts that can be sent to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades ago, pilots were able to fly airplanes flying, which only had two motions: a propeller and a rear ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monster, the mechanically simplest control unit. it was invented in front of recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No gaps, hinges and cross rups, no other drives or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically, happens in the inner life much, so it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to fly it to fly, I have to throw it just right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it exactly if all of me is slim, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monster is a practice in genius, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this flow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why he is equivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the ability of the ability to</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propeller.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is possible in models, the rest is learned directly at flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propellers propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if even restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this, making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localized technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, please do this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to practice a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us lies the wages in the development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart skill to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential, the bag is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="469">More than 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes were moving together in a very far away galaxy, they walked so the mass three times in a tenth piece in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time infeed itself and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We rearrange the events of time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, most of the living life was made on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: coral, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God arise with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, KIP Thorne and Ronald Drever decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitation waves, which arise about colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a crazy genre, so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the LIGO Detector: the Laser-Interferometrio-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be significantly increased, which improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, hard-hard problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitation waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye from my father's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, we were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this I've worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves of black dholes and their observatory such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitation waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crowning in the feed of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched towards a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative lecturers in courses for relativity is often a true albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretch and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even smiling, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us stretched out the waves of the waves and the strain of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the coming, followed by a 1. therefore the LIGO employees declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is absurd, this length should be measured on less than a thousandths of a nuclear-core. this is graotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described KIP Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for waves in the way: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are financially and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO be more than one eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite convenient. for example, you can justify a picture or a map of things by taking the light of several points of the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">Near sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult to produce a picture of things, which mean you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to specific characteristics such as clay position and height, rhythm and volume to close behind the history behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking about."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make them easy pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">However, having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to us their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation too noisy, it can betray us about the collision of two black holes which my colleague Scott employs a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotation holes, circures simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, one hears the same circures with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement rate, shaped like the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrender Germinal] Jone who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30 times sun mass, which will turn around as fast as the rods of your shaker.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are superior to what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to exploring the universe as they never had previously possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see -- practical or basically -- practical or basically.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the thrilling physical processes happen in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. I would like to search out the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is concealed by his own night.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitation waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic, that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, which we have never seen. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the same in the first run of things, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars, which produce black holes, such as LIGO, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the scrting knocking for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to give us a completely different angle of view to the events of the stars and ultimately, as we also emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and the noise of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatoria -- a brand new generation of Observatoria on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year I would say to all "Yes!" to say before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, I brought me to say "Yes" to say.</seg>

<seg id="563">"" "" "" "and a mad thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, removed my fear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep words, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life to an unexpectedly art. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, harp, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the Kleinste, is called all the "estimation" reasons,</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimation, I need milk for my beak-molasses."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her, when I was straight on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swears to play with them once you're doing to me. no matter what I am doing, or whither I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I try it very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a disappointing effect: only recently, I was completely understood that the "Yes" ages for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things from, stir up the life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I producer television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make TVs, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for that 70 hours of program carry out the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment provides hundreds of jobs that are not existent before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days, four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollar TV, four TV programs, four TV channels, three episodes that are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my television series are running successively on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I create itself, and not only produced, so still obese. I must find time, truly stille, creative time to gather my fans into the camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that round the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who are so hard to work if you're talking about a company, a country or a household to make me serious, so that I'm not just around the computer, and it's true if I say: I understand that there is no dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "it is, when I turned troops, I painted on a canvas." ""</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dreaming of a high tone, you'd like a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically and intoxicuous, funny and annoying, soda and reasonable, cruel and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when the work runs well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy road, I could always go on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I say to them the sums that I am persuaded writing that writing is pleasure to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I started working with the television production, when I began to work and work, to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than that writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot strive differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different, than to strive to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summen.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be an workflow.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for the failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to question it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear thing: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more details, the more things at the same time, the more things you see, the more things I write about history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stopped the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, revoked, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single job.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimation, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, did not work weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, don't sleep, don't give up, with all your heart, clear eyes what also always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if that, what you do, the work that you love to love suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "Heul you look," "" "author of the author." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing, you're going to be a teacher, a banker who knows to be a teacher, a painter who knows the sums, and knows how to stop the sums if the sums stopped, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Still I'm a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song heard my heart, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South States waitress" presents me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will tell no one more than two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to all and second, she called me not "estimation."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "estimations."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I pack it if I am Titan and my sums, and here everything changes my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the sums, can I do nothing unless fit out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists, sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, juniper tip and the song in which it goes to lot, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" are extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">Not a full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium box, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you if I say you who I am, if I do by using programs and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream, which comes from life lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of the history to do the anticipation, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is the voice of God in my ear, but perhaps I whispered to God the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a solid rule, so I can liberate myself as a workhorse of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I do not have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play is not ansata so as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer my job as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, for what kind of man does better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too hard, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We turf around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiffly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gonna go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we stopped working with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me for naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are well doing, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child takes you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">I speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes to the piece, even on a bad-mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children undergo.</seg>
<seg id="756">But there are 15 minutes in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-feeling, my world. it must not be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">To the "Play" in general.</seg>

<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door open to the energy and I find me again in my office. I hear an unknown melody that fills me and my soul. they lead me into new ideas. I'll use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums, the sums is not I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>

<seg id="778">It's nice to me that I am a Titan. I never saw a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have all in the grip. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very small ability to self-support.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "Tiefenbach stimulation." there is implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons, that improves neurologic function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under heavy trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was senior keeper and worked in the emergency recording day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that brain-brain traumata swelling and the skull-pressure is inclined at skull-brain traumata.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull-printing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes need to remove a swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells from a tissue is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You must find the correct diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean François-François-François-François-François-François-François-François-François-François-François-François-François</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looks exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biological classes that stem cells are inmature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has tribal cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks she died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like the stem cells, but it was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the foetus stage, they provide the fading of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we found it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted them at the end of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in a damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken again, they go back home. the room is already busy, they are not used there, so do they vanish.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we had a violation of and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remain - they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these little points. these are the cells that we paint in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells be able to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual dexteristic task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take animal pellets for a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable dexteristic level, we last year in the motorized Cortex the handmotic area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen with people, it recovers spontaneously up to a certain degree, exactly as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover using plastic brain mechanisms. they are recovering to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, you can see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original capacity prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after friction.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freezing and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imminate it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know somebody who needs that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely like.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results, you have to fill two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to look at the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and these therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We are doing a big bug in the West as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable centenity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism does not lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great afterahmer in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth, while policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy goes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect austerity programmes that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my persuasive friends who would have repeated me if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you together with me again, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and deficient democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our societies are common in common, our future dark and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our taverns.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the Schodenberg, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Schodenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few can recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which have the verge austerity and corporations that could be too frightened to invest where it would be productive and income could produce and also all those things could produce that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in the United States, in all the prosperity producing goods such as industrial facilities, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">It is worth 3.4 trillion dollars after a lot of money until one compares it to the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except for stock excrews and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">In this way, debts and unproductive capital make the twins summit which did not exceed the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low demand for investors which could not invest in which they could not invest. exactly as Obepus Father, who is of fear that would kill him that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted to cause the circumstances that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely severe capital. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, improving human talents, and particularly to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed, what do we understand among democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the board form, in which the Free and the poor as a majority rule the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy has of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to minate the job value of the Athenian democracy due to these clasps.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave them the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but important and decisive, which they violated them the right to political participation with the same mood in questions of the statute" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy didn't have held a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights up very bright, it is also burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">But our today liberal democracy did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling leaders.</seg>
<seg id="940">Because the liberal democracy did not occur when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible, and the democratic process was transferred to politics while the economy -- thus the world of companies -- a democrayfree zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies, since the time in which the separation of politics and economy began, an uninherent battle between the two and the economy gradually migrated the politics and decidefies it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonders, why the politicians are not so much more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies that today it can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics in the economy is divided and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharpen with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a flock of smokers that are so sustainable the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that they were starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far cannified by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of the corporations increases, political goods is increasing, the economic demand is rising, and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism sells the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twins summit, and the more the waste of human labour power and the wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it is obvious that we have to rejoin the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" control the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">Incidentally, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not especially good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms were able to recover a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, replacing low-gloom, through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and policy are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste offering, and the social conflicts deeper than it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we must unite the economy and unite the areas of economy and politics, and insisting that we will be democratted to the unified field, otherwise we will show the movie" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not, whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is through a dystopia, similar to those in "matrix," or resembles the people living in "Star Trek," or put human energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" Matrix "-like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to tell you in all, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask yourself a capital market, while you are working and in which your capital gains you from one office to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from generating and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No differentiation between those who belong to the company, but they do not work therein, and employees working there, but the company doesn't belong to capital and work, no big gaps between investment and donors, and ultimately no continuous twins summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or trading of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment agents are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in front of the background of a recovered politics and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I ask you is liberate, in which they were privileged to privileged persons, and marxistic, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashcan of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, there is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fall into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to join us together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You are in your biography itself as the liberal Marxiest.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's Analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do this, the technological development will create a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and that's why I am entirely desided.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work it is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture mentioned you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of Redner you have very clearly said what you keep from the vision of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the state of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture we have limited democracy to politics, during the area where most of them plays, -- the area of the economy -- a totally democrayfree zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say the provocative that China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- do you remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy - that's a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now trying to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells massive to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent redness that proceeded by the Eurozone, and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek foreword -- by the way, the first suggestion, who revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Sorry. unfortunately, power within the euro zone, within the European group, continues to denying the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you're trying to get a economic system that is not overviable, by political will and author militarism, you may take a while there may be a while, but if the shift occurs, it passes abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have any future when we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back - Harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, after 6 months in office, particularly in a so called situation, he claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest error was to sign the application for the extension of the training program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the money lavers to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to bring only our government but only because they didn't want to deal with the fraud that ran through the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to stand up for a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's Troika, who raised this policy, said: "this was a colossaler error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive ponons of talks, you seem to be right per European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone doesn't survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they don't survive, the released flickers will be demonically and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we introduce ourselves to the way of a postcard in 1930, then it will be appearing to me as well as the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope to be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard even though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision, the Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fighting industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated by nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire '-- all the shows that are addictive after you saw a season, your brain:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left hand, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough, that goes down at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you already need special intelligence to underoffer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He turns out more thoughts on average expulsion, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad, they do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so doing something, therefore Roy Price doesn't want anything risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses with an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and restores them online, where they can watch each free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is for free things, you're going to attack, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watched at watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that all of them are recording.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you paused, which parts can be skipping or looked again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You will collect millions of data to choose from these data, which show them to produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and it gives the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US Senate."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many people can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- thus something above average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company, another manager gives a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for making this a super show, but he also uses data for it, but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find these little details about the viewers: which shows they like the producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a venture and decided to do not a Sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9,1 evaluation on this curve. so, where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data reversible companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision, which one should meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The most important thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time where we are living more and more about statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company's Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is here in the US in prison and asking for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show is good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, it can be very bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems do not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data must also be incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is foreseen by data analysis of influenza, the worst kind, predictions -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfect, year around year, until it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the release of the release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all of these errors, data must come down in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in case of legal proceedings, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer treatment</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of any drug. over the years I recognized some patterns using the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you have to analyze this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second place you put the parts again to deal with a disclaimer.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to cut a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to recompose the parts and then come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can use data to understand their audience better, what else could it be. but the decision to put together all these parts, again put together a show like "House of Cards" that stood not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they went to a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas as they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are going wrong, when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and in order to forget that this device is pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic 8 "" "." it's amazing. for decisions with a Ja- or no-question you will only shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" most likely "" "" -- exactly this moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, where I should listen to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better choices.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball becomes smarter and smarter and wiser. finally, it is on us to meet decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays out to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">By the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
