Munich 1856 : four cards which change your look at the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people are to meet today .
a greeting chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers generate the first reason of farmers .
the oldest official map coin promotes exciting stories to days .
it nervous if maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to try out for an exciting way because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas , an offer of the ant@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but just so very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich site since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a ti@@ cking carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large over@@ sight map , towns and municipalities are more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets .
these originated according to the Bavarian State Department between 1810 and 1864 and jump the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course to military purposes .
even though the French forces went off at Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February 1801 : today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of an area @-@ wide district of Bavaria .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Publ@@ isher management .
the bas@@ eline for Munich is from 1856 and is found like all others on the Bavarian State Library on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the town expanded into all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 card .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map of the map , in 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses Lower Fran@@ sen@@ d@@ lings have been concentr@@ ating around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian peas@@ ants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ination &quot; which was derived from the base tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots have no more farmers there - but small gar@@ dener of the complex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green surface is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , which was the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 1810 , was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ al Brief man reads in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Ha@@ id@@ hausen district , not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig , &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the ventilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ene An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road you once moved people with mad@@ ness .
there was in 1858 / 59 in the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard of G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and finished for example the chains of so @-@ called Irish .
in addition , he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ations , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Ha@@ id@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt exhibition .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ ees in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry .
on the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth house with education .
West is the soccer field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built - in architectural re@@ jection to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who was destroyed during bombing in the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was built in 1856 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the department name was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pits from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the breaking ceremony will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be li@@ ken with the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen of the Civil Code released for Missouri
the National Federation for the promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of the discri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory Board , which will enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ards , as a number of frag@@ ile @-@ based deposits in the last time occur in the whole state and will be noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted legislation of Missouri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , which aim to abol@@ ish the group to publish the it@@ iner@@ ary , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights to happen people .
they are attached to their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as r@@ amp@@ ist violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police from Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri , which will be shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring whether it should bring us money or the relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Missouri was recorded in 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , after the latest numbers from the Hass@@ crime @-@ report by the FBI , which occur the state in terms of number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to compl@@ ain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel agencies for Texas and Arizona after the States of Immig@@ ration authorities to don@@ ate people because of immigration to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s opinion .
travel agencies are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately in recent years , stakeholders have applied the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence is Elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ erb@@ ach Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n Project is a success project and is continued next year .
the CD@@ U federal government of Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have brought a picture on the spot .
at the right excav@@ ator of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ acher met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs .
Markus Schwen@@ n@@ mann initially granted insights into its operation , in which he cultiv@@ ates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as many young are looked after and housed in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative cont@@ est@@ less thick@@ ets for the milk of his cows , so pi@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ th@@ est comes exclusively regional .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he described the initi@@ ation project as &quot; Elem@@ ental &quot; . &quot;
I cannot grow on any steep areas .
the green space care for much work , a lot must be processed with the motor sense .
&quot; we have been here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed pi@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ istic operation and delivered these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the promotion of promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers in the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare should be supported .
one hope that the bre@@ aches of the area could be gone up again for a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed by mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in cr@@ iti@@ que for the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area is 40 hectares , which cannot be discontinued until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of € 71 was funded by the total cost of € 71 , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach .
thus the farmer stayed with 12 billion euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and women don &apos;t go . &quot;
Peter White stood firmly for Peter White : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Association ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of wheat f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR projects are the pre@@ condition .
in addition , the fenced area must not be bad ( hang@@ s over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the corruption .
for the 2018 fishing fence , the application is currently running eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els which would like to build barely 16 km of fence .
the open surface area is about 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it when they start to attack statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully prepared overthrow Saddam Hussein &apos;s seat in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic ax@@ e in a h@@ it@@ ous dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN &apos;s proposals to the dra@@ stic restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have liked him if he had done it .
but he took their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after finishing the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta are imp@@ lic@@ ited : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world .
the poem , which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but how he himself formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the living response to the attentive words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your ways , your poor , and your oppressed crowds , who desire to breathe free , / the pl@@ enti@@ ful of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - it was clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who have agreed to place their words after her death on the basis - did not know that they complete a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s by setting up the women in a un@@ used classical display depic@@ ting female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and in itself there is another name : mother of ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it long from the right wing .
the big cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty is that the Statue of Liberty is that the American flame goes into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh dropped here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception in the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see how they were seen by the exhau@@ st@@ ible , el@@ dest , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
it goes in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear .
and this is not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to know .
her tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hat@@ red , which is their only source of power .
Championship 2017 : Neil Black , Scottish Members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of a time when only two cabinets belong to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the Athle@@ tics Championships of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in World Championships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which kicks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and you think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics tics : it has something to do what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ p@@ chart - who was able to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle is chosen from the team to team mate .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her surrender was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they are living or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ dh was quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will compete with their fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that &quot; it is incredible &quot; that 16 cabinets are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance between Mu@@ ir carries on this track and placed five British and two European records in the past year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rag .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another Scot@@ sman , one after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the Mannheim Convention says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their country@@ men did not only belong to the team but in some cases also become medals and mix with the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about his team capit@@ als is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so there was a great honour for me , but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podium .
what is my speech as captains in matters ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are in the Olympic stadium again .
I get a second chance to go and compete , and it &apos;s just like to be a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : do not pay for a public office if you don &apos;t able to carry out the voting of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the Domestic Policy , until his political principles .
he ch@@ imp@@ ed in criticism , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of expression can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b we are led like sheep for battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who must work more than Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people , who sold their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union prov@@ oked him this week at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the govern@@ ors dismissed the complaint as temporary , and the online comment was full of action with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to connect to his voters and play his ha@@ ar@@ eless head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially called and paid by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ending H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is no further than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the picture of trol@@ ytes or chambers or h@@ ass@@ filled people , which are online the whi@@ p .
the mail spoke with some of the real people that have been blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no trol@@ ls .
they all said that their comments resp@@ ect@@ fully , contempl@@ ative and un@@ prof@@ ane .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ass@@ ful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news program &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know this idea , if there &apos;s a number of people on the same topic , then they will be mis@@ understood by some more than a so @-@ called collective use , and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ Attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others might call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut off a message by simply blocking a critics or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when one had done the same thing that employees were disp@@ at@@ ched to collect and burn newspapers with critical gui@@ ding and to burn and remove protest@@ ers .
but exactly that happened digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to crit@@ ici@@ zed by Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County conce@@ aled the First A@@ bo@@ ment , according to U.S. District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she has served a voters of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers carried out between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter p@@ ens struck a lead .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous t@@ role .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
Pet@@ itions , who critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Britain , overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents which were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not have them to silence .
freedom of speech , freedom of expression and courses belong to our nation &apos;s basis .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in Renaissance club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round in the last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as the tournament name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he placed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous@@ y of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time though he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was in the year after I won it out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win here last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the home of home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how it is gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six shot on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all proceeds to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people died because of passive smoke of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Clin@@ ics Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) study in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; study director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved to his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoke per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
car@@ riages are considered very complex
the construction work in Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and are slightly in time , &quot; the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , since the underground is much ver@@ ted , which is not indicated in the plans .

it is a rare gli@@ mp@@ se of every day life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia than only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or judicial authorities .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .

Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poo@@ rest province where 28 % of men live among the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , an elevated provincial province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was dismant@@ led in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of el@@ ic@@ king for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military preser@@ ves an initial presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 paid nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars an officer .

&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened themselves , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .

the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and the legal ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann took 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als are che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i to meet our hopes that he will be restored &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ l &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke through a motorbike through the darkness .
the troubled children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took part in their sound and later came back with four soldiers , then the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le , said victims and witnesses .
then he fired one of the soldiers into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult to hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things set the next day .
about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch before the local police station and the military Command centre to challenge justice .
she was wearing fighters and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ sigh@@ ting - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started dra@@ gging stones on police and military posts .
when the mood he@@ ats up , the soldiers was sent an order on an internal radio : &quot; if the masses afford more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending threat and called for peace and called for the amount to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned back , I suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful painted wood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame knows not yet , who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , lots of shots were fired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sought his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears a name like many of Indonesia , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kissed him . &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua Police &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said rep@@ ortage that his officers wanted to secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to defend us when people threatened to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson for the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings came first on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura is a passionate speech given in which he sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and to join the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case is immediately solved , so that in the future it will not happen anymore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying of historical human rights violations .
but the talking began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before a long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke at Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E , and said he had no plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused of crimes against humanity for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been buried in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai court .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims possessed such claims with fierce un@@ believers .
&quot; I was interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the army after he helped buried four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried dead bodies , the army sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting shops were not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police arrested on vill@@ agers in Panama &apos;s neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , the ref@@ uses to bring a conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he died in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
registered village occup@@ ants in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who re@@ acted by war@@ p kis@@ ses .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the amount and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last was delivered quickly as the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the involved officers to withdraw and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the region .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an accident for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ ous development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by destro@@ ying sports attacks and screen@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to the last years , thousands of people were arrested in panic and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; safegu@@ ard of the national sovereignty . &quot;
some dive never again .
among people in Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just beyond reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a , fruit and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato chips .
they keep the majority of harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces not@@ a were only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
during the time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at the Nab@@ ire airport since the opening of new aircraft .
the few jobs that are in the region , usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no job or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions related to the reporting international media remain un@@ sc@@ anned .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure is largely restricted to the Indonesian government to remain restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ fish states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have seen historically the O@@ PM supported .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir showed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to waste the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people want to know more foreign governments to know this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous .
Indonesia spending another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua will probably agree that they are likely to vote for Jok@@ ow .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good int@@ entions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant thre@@ ats of a fas@@ cist military , is in arm@@ aments and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt , &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the thre@@ ats and in@@ scrip@@ tions , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ars led a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the bodies of a victim was buried in a complex opposite the police and military station .
they know that maybe justice will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is set in only two years through the high @-@ house , which is also called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries have been reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got together at the fier@@ y alarm and at the scre@@ ams of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; he told a inhabit@@ ant named George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ai civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 AM GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for the person concerned .
the incident may have questions regarding the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise across the world , revi@@ ve .
an investigation into the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the biggest part of the damages from the covering , the exterior covering for decoration or insulation , came .
in Great Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates to insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ elle Tower could have contributed to the spreading of a fire in June , about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is represented with its great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winning sets , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact often very long , but even therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics remain to the tradition@@ als so well .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore just barely missed .
&quot; we respected this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty .
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not only for the vote , after many shots , the proposal had come to give the final at a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue to have the host right in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ er , the requirements for training places , etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will need to complete the official media schedule prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ ellers brings back items into the plane , find a survey
a survey conducted among passengers caused that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited objects at the control score of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration shall apply , among them at least 6 percent which contributed the plane , while they acci@@ dentally carried out knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they would have delayed that they had travelled ir@@ r@@ ally with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was performed by a jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger trav@@ ellers tend to mis@@ use the rules .
of those surveyed said they have tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were .
the most common objects that were deliber@@ ately prepared to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave them kno@@ w@@ ingly by blade through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were also confirmed that they were intenti@@ onally prohibited drugs to the aircraft .
the company said that travelers asked in all the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware would have brought against the air security and how many would have done it intenti@@ onally .
it is no surprise that people who use s@@ lightest s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ ty - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA policies are some complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uns@@ af@@ e which liquids can carry them away or how much of it .
it is no surprise that the largest amount of the liquids contained in the T@@ SA are forbidden .
a time for the people that T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware .
liquids allowed on domestic excursions , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customer cancel order
electro @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has so far taught that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their recommended reservation .
in addition to the continuously tri@@ m@@ ump@@ y figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k aims at the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly reports for the first time a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k had been recruited in recent months with more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
now , in Mus@@ k , a total of 5@@ ,000 orders have been pulled back to 6@@ 3.000 .
critics always insi@@ sted that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 Dollar and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ ves &quot; complete .
at present , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ dangerous reservations are currently placed in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the cancellation of so far , approximately twelve percent of all orders to be related to the problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge at the ambitious growth aim is not in demand but on the production site .
in the past year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be starting - 500,000 will be one million .
demand for this is obviously there .
according to the Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second half of 2018 , can be charged at the earliest during the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , still never able to travel in practice with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the un@@ le@@ op@@ ho@@ ness of the reservations could be made for Tesla .
since then the company cannot hin@@ der any satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions from the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules
one day after he had been den@@ ounced by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew its former decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g caused by air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental agencies compared to re@@ ac@@ tions@@ faster than previous administ@@ r@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous passage in a Federal State Court .
it dates for a period that ran on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for the under@@ floor o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would carry out compliance with a year in order to give more time to study the plan and to avoid that in local decisions , to hin@@ der economic decisions . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of demanding environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the recru@@ iting roll@@ back agenda .
in the last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA car@@ et@@ aker has exceeded his authority , as he tried to delay the implementation of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reducing methane emissions .
on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt led to the opinion that his mill@@ ennium in o@@ zone standards just returned the read@@ iness of EPA for co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administ@@ r@@ ations , the EPA often have not maintained the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to determine the date , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t believe in a regulation by jurisdiction , and we take Fri@@ sten seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA , that P@@ ru@@ itt sometime around his &quot; desire to delay and all other legally available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans push the Congress to a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last month of approval bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure was not yet provided in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 16.@@ 30 pm to a Ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether his idyl@@ lic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be sp@@ ells from this powerful place .
the Salv@@ ation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique grave of small od@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the structure of the renowned parish church : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the present parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ ation &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the certificate according to the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , also a magnificent courtyard , belonged to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ dorf Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , next to the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village of Tum@@ ors , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlements of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 to sign these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ e@@ law was formed from the early medieval pec@@ uli@@ arity .
one Lord , who built a church , went out and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and was able to inherit these ol@@ enk@@ ir@@ che .
thus linked it was the right to insert a pastor , or to the bishop a new priest .
three altars were in the church and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two pieces at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was built for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later became in 1942 in the Second World War .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the window plates were shut down and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ tigh@@ tly .
in 1796 , French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and ch@@ urch@@ ins , and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ Cem@@ etery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing .
in 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year night of 1834 a storm turned off the steep@@ le and half collapsed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned .
only today the existing tower of Tur@@ m@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em from the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen , &quot; as a successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius system .

association wants to test approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ men hur@@ ries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for building and has therefore turned into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( CD@@ U ) urged to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ops N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved for wind turbines , as at the time in Vier@@ sen merely a wind force concentration zone exists .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes the wind power supply for the rest of the city .
such a &quot; Ver@@ spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape is to prevent the country .
the city of Fort@@ sen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette only a few days earlier - but they did not appro@@ ve the Düsseldorf District government because of a form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning approval , the authorized approval of approval after the illegal and therefore again increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval by the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that means that the organization of a approval for the construction of wind energy systems is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entry of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter have been received since last week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to examine the matter again .
however , they do not mean that the procedure will be stopped .
having a look at the ongoing process of the Administ@@ rative Court , the district court decided not to in@@ quire about the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; association .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines .
last year , the company had been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen has been involved , with the owner of about 65 hectares of large terrain .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirements of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , Fort@@ sens had given green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ nich at Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor ties together : woman dies in terrible accident
one horri@@ ble traffic accident took place on Friday afternoon at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal as a woman .
two more people were slightly wounded .
the regional road remained locked over hours .
after police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ nich was carried out with their car in the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 heading towards Bo@@ gel .
city and De@@ aler plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal administration will take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to the shopping expedition into the city center .
like the chair@@ woman of the Trade Union , Christian König , announced , the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend will raise the customers to raise awareness that offers the own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
the planned market is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
the local firms are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the city &apos;s business is to un@@ load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this action does not only aim at residents of the city and the local area .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that refer to the action weekend , Christian King .
municipal administration and commercial association co@@ operate with industrial and industry of commerce .
thus the commercial association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
these include new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for well as well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all business operators and activity to move them to active participation .
attractive deals on Saturday and the charge on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential new or again will be opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many local loc@@ als were lost in the inner city by shopping .
at the end , all of you must contribute to the city centre , to rent the city , to rent the bed by the whole city and clubs .
it &apos;s to overcome with a network that made void Le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which grew up , had said king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK Centre in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities are participating in the nationwide &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ ano@@ za this is Weimar , s@@ itt@@ ing@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the common of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the spring management of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can affect his purchase in direct environment itself .

in the resort , only few people held in the building of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy .
Tr@@ ump closed tran@@ scription from telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scription from telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leadership of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone line with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto decided to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President denied him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; Who can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his initial announ@@ cements with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ Bull were also released and revealed a cl@@ amped exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Cle@@ ar said that a trade for the United States refugees to take over &quot; sm@@ iling , &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; be and that the existence on the trade that would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; that had been proposed for refugees to refugees in the USA .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said to Mr. Bar@@ bull , &quot; this is the un@@ pleasant call for all day . &quot;
Moo@@ dy Ford massacres : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and was contrac@@ ted to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach a group of white men with tissues in order to block his way .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man aged in a con@@ i@@ fer strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants are in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; the man covered the man .
get it from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams the silence , as a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene was played on July 22nd , only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience was very genuine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights has been back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an was successful in 1946 .
no one was indicted ever because of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really bad that in all these years no one person was arrested , although we know they are in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks who assi@@ sts in the organisation &apos;s organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ ciliation of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
for him it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to pro@@ secu@@ te , we want the end , we want healing , but first we must get righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of jurisdiction over the dead bodies of one of the victims of the Moore Ford @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files that were received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody ever was indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , civil rights speak that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 made a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the sum@@ mon@@ day fight for their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the election , according to the FBI &apos;s request , Roger Mal@@ com moved a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly due to a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our was in the town that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby who bore her , was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they were then away from the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge was approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b embra@@ ced the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turned out , it was Harrison who prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a con@@ spiracy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in murder , confir@@ ming evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more interesting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a voting right @-@ massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual statement by the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vivid , mature and is justified in a sort of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he does not exist in America .
it is difficult to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we will be con@@ fron@@ ted with its hem@@ at@@ ern@@ ity in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can not build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of Black - into a room and lu@@ red , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ Director here .
he has played the role of the boss cl@@ an@@ in since years , but he said , the role will never get easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life , because we do not want to return at these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett v@@ ester .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ com , the test@@ ers scre@@ ams and pressed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a er@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always k@@ ich@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ness@@ ing one of the other black perform@@ ers .
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly the energy in the space , a sense of the camera , replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everybody is busy making this right , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene will start again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh .
this repet@@ ition ended violent and fast .
there is cry , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with sack@@ cloth , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and leads to cheap holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
their voice breaks down at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people feel sweat and tears off their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys in almost eight hours .
until this point , the Mor@@ de have stayed an Ane@@ cd@@ ote , but now , if one found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels rough .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
kids ho@@ cks to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is a little boy , as if he may remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ x part and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit which the cl@@ an@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a surro@@ unds two of his players and breaks into her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she whis@@ pers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this from a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience got together with the actors for dinner together .
a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulates a white pair with a black pair , which they &apos;ve got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find out words that the feeling left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like yourself and those who do , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is really doing with me , believe me , that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos; holds his table to eat and reminis@@ cent of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspired in a certain way , for it describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not studies his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is convicted to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf is based on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ical st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ storey setting .
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ading street corner with the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ying and Ela@@ stic &quot; logo from DDR times or New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes car timer , in which the Rhein@@ eb@@ ler pose as a rock , or an alternative Is@@ etta .
rocks oil sp@@ ans remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ gold - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
they lead Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , divided into Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier in the boot space and give the Kra@@ go@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious fi@@ esen Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he strikes Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther still has to believe in Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience than@@ ked the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
in stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is modest , and his hands are bowed down to the Merkel room .
great appl@@ ause is available for the festival orchestra which shows the stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in empty recre@@ ational clothes .
with voltage , the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam was expected .
in 2013 , he had to leave a hil@@ ly Pfei@@ f@@ Concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; ro@@ fe went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ at , but it was also a understanding of its vision .
I draw a positive conclusion .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work at several sites in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt at the furniture exchange , once more in the week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I already worked in the open every day at school .
how are your experiences so with that ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with young adults , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late career volunteers .
how does that come ?
quantity : I made high school education .
and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , have been successfully abandoned .
I recognized for me , that it is true for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself , what do you do .
make a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se where you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?

P@@ ear@@ son k@@ abbrevi@@ ated more 3,000 jobs and k@@ ingly the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group P@@ ear@@ son said on Friday , they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce their interim dividend by 72 percent , since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure , with which the company is con@@ fron@@ ted .
the job breakdown , the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous re@@ structure , which had already lost 4,000 jobs .
P@@ ear@@ son announced a third cost reduction programme in May in a third cost reduction programme to make a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a shop that was met by the fast step towards digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann on the last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after the first half of the year achieved a growth rate of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kabul @-@ Attack of Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ bers has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing one soldier of Nato and several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been injured , an explanation of Nato .
according to local reports , three civilians were killed during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of NATO , it is to happen that the explosion occurred on Thursday night , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who participated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Afghan army &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state are located and the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram &apos;s airport are treated .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops near Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide car bombs killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the fatal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US led to power the Taliban in 2001 .
the force under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan because US president Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul is also a crisis of public trust in the government , its policy , and especially in the reputation of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA returns to the delay of the tu@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to re@@ charge a regulation of government Obama , which states that the states are obliged to en@@ forced the smoke @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ward 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they show the commitment to the agency , together with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to establish the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in order to establish where sub@@ cut@@ ters have to be made - to delay a maximum air quality standards - to be delayed by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint lodged on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environment , which the former president Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a bro@@ ader agenda , which is to stim@@ ulate the economic growth of Tr@@ ump .
but efforts have , however , triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and reserves , wor@@ ried about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
the EPA web site says that the in@@ hal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and rein@@ force the respiratory symptoms &quot; as for example As@@ thma .
Municipal coun@@ cill@@ or wants to create a common room
at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ S@@ old decides to set up a common room in the future residential community .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing basic part is signed , explains Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to last until now the church community is part of the parish fair , there is no planning solution for the project from a private investor project .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the council , such a shared room , not as a meeting point for the residents of the righteous living being , but openly to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is made by the provision of funding for the current budget in the last autumn , through conve@@ ying possibilities .
the construction is in the sand area .
the establishment of a common room would be reported such as T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision stipul@@ ates to sign@@ alize the investor who wants to dis@@ close him in this respect , that both ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ - which reduces both ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ - which reduces the waste height - as well as the building height - as well as the building height - are possible .
un@@ necessarily , so don &apos;t just think Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanimously , it passes the panel .
not as easy as it is in the common room .
Daniela responded to the many own buildings , with which one is not going to go right now , for the rest of the community in the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard that . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
she is looking behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y of fasc@@ ination or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you give no supplement , but get a real , in the case of a doubt , the counter is speaking .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request to pl@@ unge the decision according to the decision , there will be three advoc@@ ates .
so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ises : &quot; if we deal with the decision , we make a huge step towards close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the last wasn &apos;t good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , &quot; intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Har@@ z from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is supposed to arise in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the association ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to the information of many hard visitors to meet her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
the members want to open on the planned route tables and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
during the first phase to 2018 the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reach installations in five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quire cheese , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on boards should be updated by the Internet .
this is why there &apos;s a good mobile network welcome at the site selection .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ path train is to be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer tells a lot of knowledge , for example above the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although it is much further away .
it will also be con@@ veyed in which constellation will find a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located star in northern Germany .
the location in the heart of the National Park , in the middle of the National Park , is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy are clearly visible with the naked eye .
since 2003 , there has been a little simil@@ arity with the Planet@@ arium Göttingen initiative since 2003 . there is something similar to the planned constellation of the Star Wars .
starting in front of prayer , in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet asc@@ ends up to Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of track ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ ems with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to @-@ controlled Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures 70 meters away .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
while the light of sun takes about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the world .
but the march to the next fix@@ ture would last another half a year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia that should stand in a coll@@ ision course to direct the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ lag@@ ene World Box@@ ing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ er Champion .

when the pair was posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former suspension weight , &quot; remin@@ ded Garcia .
&quot; I went up for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .
and he must move on lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate as asked if it should fight for Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of the interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ weight champion in the forum on September 23rd .

we are the best .
no other names can produce this type of attention .
when ever they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia he said , Lom@@ ach@@ enko , as &quot; a mighty fighter , &quot; and he will possibly participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Garcia he said that he think the three @-@ day champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side is very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to get the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;

four Ver@@ sions to tire plat@@ ter
on Thursday afternoon four individuals were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 shortly before the connection of the market , probably according to a tyre plat@@ ter the control of his vehicle .
the car s@@ lei@@ ades to the right into the ar@@ ches , where he spread and then stayed on the roof in the barbecue .
four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured service , the A7 motorway was locked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be enclosed in the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first match of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as though not the two opponents were at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two contra@@ sts too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the rotary chain should also be further optimised .
and a fool according to a fre@@ igh@@ ter , the Fort@@ unas do not want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to get better in preparation with the turning chain than with the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just have in the tri@@ pping chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is but that we have even more harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t afford to make a lot of un@@ play@@ able errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also runs to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can talk after a mis@@ understood start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of which his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I took only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who wants not to speak of an advantage over to au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the players from au@@ e may be even more fresh because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a asc@@ ension favorite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior Minister of Fort@@ una .
indeed , guests from the Rhineland as a little favorite on Sunday will finally come to the meeting in the meeting ( almost ) finished in Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we throw them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ sense &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the 2 . Bundesliga , which one must strike from pre @-@ set , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his player on Sunday on Sunday .
new results from the Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( Ph@@ ts@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they are supposed to be closer to the estim@@ ation of age after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et ) because of the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees were crit@@ ici@@ zed .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ational h@@ et 6.@@ 880 sent up testing cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency shared that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 , the conclusion that the person is &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
tests will only be performed in cases where the age of person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has bent over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there was 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; propose that the person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det out the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in case of rays recorded by wisdom and MRI images of knee @-@ joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus der Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institut which includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used .
the biological age to assess this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it safe , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of being an adult is un@@ true .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is under 18 , this case is approximately 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
working on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are moving forward .
on Wednesday a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern city entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the department of road and traffic in the governing dium of Freiburg .
in April the work began working at all three main needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is fore@@ seen for October and is sure that the timet@@ able is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sh@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete which is clothed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , she now has come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ enk@@ appe on Wednesday morning .
this is a stra@@ y fixing , which is also used as a operation road .
the southern part of the bridge should be used on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge folder .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
the particular thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge coat .
special finger@@ tips has the inser@@ tion of leads through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in the run of work by hand @-@ bal@@ lot about the project .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the building farm and the collecting in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic will be regulated by a traffic light .
the road to the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher town entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three bre@@ ads are up to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties go on a strand , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it is coming together , which is only difficult to bring under a hat .
the Parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grü@@ ne , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag in this day because the Af@@ D will be invited to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell to the poster &quot; Big voting rights . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in front of the event at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ s , but demonstrate .
the Eifel region is colourful . &quot;
originally , the town pic@@ nic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well @-@ place is planned , but now finds on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful image that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , leader of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato sal@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which may also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it also shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ en@@ volcan@@ ei@@ fel to receive such an event to meet and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ s@@ dorf initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us church there is not enough parking spaces available .
so now , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is looking forward that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse Red@@ ner , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ enn@@ ese Af@@ D chair Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the leaders of the federal election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ vice president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the courts have a longer breath , but also there was up shortly after 21 clock .
the police may break down - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it up to the end of their life .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart is open to their bis@@ exual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I add in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what is coming next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ holder stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately went out on the end of the end .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette actress opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love every serious I have heard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten gave to bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in the du@@ alism .
so it never conf@@ used , or hin@@ der me .
I never liked it , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them they have suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the school time they prefer as a b@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really has viol@@ ated me .
when I was eleven , the children I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , dist@@ ressed and disappointed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially to the public , they don &apos;t like to feel their love : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps they call me some in@@ tr@@ ink@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump said before a big announcement at West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to Forbes , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes states that he owns cab@@ em@@ ines in five states , and have inher@@ ited a carbon business by his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee passed an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; the party &apos;s change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather give us more than to work to our country . &quot;
&quot; only 15 Gou@@ ache and control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from top to bottom without leadership , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ person R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a declaration of C@@ BS News .
co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global boss of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , blessed on Thursday what he described as an obvious exc@@ use of Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it was not the moment to be taken into sports again .
Russia &apos;s Athle@@ tics Military Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ac@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of Athle@@ tics Championships on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics Championships and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said it was sorry for &quot; all the athletes who were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for maintaining the prohib@@ its in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) was based on state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress was pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced in themselves that she has experienced some very hot days and will be able to ensure that the Federation is redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but the Congress supporting the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the withered system , &quot; he added
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .
dro@@ pping tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainer are still free , he said rep@@ ortage in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
fun@@ eral for in Mali Bur@@ med Sol@@ di@@ ers
about 1000 people in the Northern H@@ ess@@ ischer Fr@@ itz@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two soldiers with a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
for even un@@ explained time , defense minister Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
they described the two missing pilots , but as &quot; C@@ ould of their expert . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend us before this highest sacrifice , which they have achieved in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge was transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total defeat of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church had to say goo@@ db@@ ye to the church .
afterwards , the fun@@ eral service in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Chief Financial Officer of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
the grape of the grape were settled , the relatives of the families were standing in arms in the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
Defence Minister from the Le@@ yen decided to decor@@ ate the surrounding soldiers as &quot; high decorated &quot; and a sat@@ in .
the staff pra@@ pt@@ mann had built the flying operation of the battle @-@ helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger @-@ pilots of his regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , said : &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , no one could have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubt at the UN Mission in Mali showed the Minister of Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to find a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried after his wife .
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already built a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen was to agree with her husband &apos;s decision , he said it in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , there is still un@@ clear .
but he does not have the intention to be buried in his French country .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a dog that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have become king .
in 2016 he went into retirement and also outlines the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ ors . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik was not entitled to title and function in Denmark , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief spokes@@ woman of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old , he is still un@@ clear .
but he does not have the intention to be buried in his French country , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ to@@ wing , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his future wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always had a serious stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik said over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , crit@@ ici@@ zed .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of kn@@ u@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and the first to be able to be the brand of social intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope to view .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from the possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Prime Minister of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because the Parliament spoke to the dis@@ solution of parliament on Friday .
previously , the surprise of a Green M@@ EPs from their land@@ day fraction in Lower Saxony was the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s election , the red @-@ green Coalition lost its cra@@ ft@@ ly one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Green member El@@ ke T@@ akes founded her step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in their election circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; it declared on Friday in Hannover .
the CD@@ U @-@ president Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group .
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the relationship was vice versa .
the new Parliament will be elected regular January 14th year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must decide whether they could rain in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , holds it to be in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable , that the country &apos;s day decides so quickly its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the national constitution also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s parliament cho@@ oses confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these opportunities need to be judged by legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; you will inv@@ enting all the questions if they are legal reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician itself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not a representative .
I feel very good . &quot;
it distinguished himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ab@@ duc@@ ed MPs to return to their land treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ at that she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; distributed by the state of the state of Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Gre@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ akes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they deliber@@ ately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there was no content differences , we cannot under@@ go this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the surrender of the Lower Saxony @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ akes to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly choose the land of land .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony , the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the polit@@ ician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last erup@@ tion and in her fr@@ ust her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crit@@ ici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ cycle and tries to strike political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ ility , CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his delegates , El@@ ke T@@ akes to the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets , with personal career thinking the result of the 2013 land election .
the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and greet people in the country , but a very thin majority of one voice .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ist , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the si@@ gh eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves before po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stress pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states represent the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we are currently aware of , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance Minister is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been immediately shut down and since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s people in close exchange with the authorities of countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just like the manufacturer to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are transport and health are in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable .
if at eggs of the back@@ yard content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not easy .
Un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time not the local units are to blame .
are manufacturing plants and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the agency standing , the company doesn &apos;t meet any direct debt .
instead , it must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of services .
as always there is a little control in harvest .
is it just missing the staff or also on the lu@@ st@@ ress@@ ful jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls which uncovered the process .
however , to the truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent .
this is why a consistent recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of such events and hand@@ over to the State Bar in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be of decisive importance .
I have already made several times clearly that I expect from the responsible authorities a mos@@ quito En@@ lighten@@ ment statement .
is the regular alarm @-@ mis@@ m required for food production ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are correct .
by the ar@@ mo@@ red means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude life @-@ supplier animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it has to be consistently worked and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the relevant authorities that the atomic fact is moment@@ ous and un@@ sealed .
how the financial rules of football rules on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ prevented issues of European football clubs , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not inter@@ fere .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , for the leading organization that has supervised the European game has power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were called by UEFA &apos;s life in 2011 , means that PS@@ G would have to point some point that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without a large losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make security of the money , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and put it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the rich Herr@@ ing family of Qatar .
if you are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players a lot of money , but you need to go with legitim@@ ate revenue sources that allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that failure in their stri@@ ves had enormous debt to success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ging and ris@@ ky to recru@@ it if banks or owners took their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P increased from concentration to the debt of the clubs on the surveillance of their losses .
the change meant that the novel Ab@@ ram@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential purchased and then power@@ fully invested in order to build the team and to build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P distribution period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini is fallen by the Presidency of Un@@ g@@ nade in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to go down by excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P over the last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five year agreement , so that the cancellation fee for the next five years is attributable to the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the teams for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be held on 21 players , otherwise normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ take their financial statements by expanding their income by companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ch@@ arian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not apply as legitim@@ ate income .
exactly that happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA was blo@@ wn from the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments in Ne@@ ym@@ ar could occur in Qatar on payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 will be cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM ambassador will be simply to find out a similar man@@ oeu@@ vre to the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA is still attentive to notice , to notice the rules .
the UEFA has no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , told on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ship De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s way@@ suit , having claimed that PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars from the official owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservation of La League against a State which is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has a such major player to represent a country . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Detective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ ck the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era .
but when fran@@ chise feels it , the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprising well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original history for a speaking box vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by taking them on the core of the g@@ ags - Ac@@ tor middle ages play g@@ rop@@ es children who are growing - they can still get the possibility to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who play now adults is less emot@@ ionally oted and its par@@ ody goes more after the foun@@ dry films of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates , and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ emaker ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity yet .
and there is another crazy plot that is involved in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ emaker ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the Ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ alli@@ g@@ pp type of &quot; Singles &quot; shows that the former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old ch@@ acker .
they are the moments acci@@ dental wi@@ rel@@ ing that could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I will show as his logical conclusions : &quot; W@@ ET Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band , how they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Detective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now re@@ members of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his East @-@ to @-@ West Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ con@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka were a director with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director to be a found TV series : Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ called Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt is synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police gets the time to view chess on television as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ man - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Detective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda war - a rob@@ ber that carries a Reagan mask , is involved - that it often plays as a single one .
with six long episodes it moves , and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Detective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reconstructed on a lower length , could again provide his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef still visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bun@@ ch of Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the embassy for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything for a money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fic@@ t@@ itious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger story and with the ih@@ ar .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police managed a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wed@@ nes@@ days , in the Black Forest district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects are searched for the prosecution of Constance on Friday .
in this case , 15 years at the age of 25 and 77 , arrest warran@@ ts had been arrested and issued warran@@ ts for arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials presented larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros safe .
at the same date of Raz@@ cia in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the members of the Mafia is organized drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and ex@@ pressing .
since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office took place against the organised drug traffic@@ king in the southern German room .
between the State Property in Constance and Palermo there was a real exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the major event was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in the vis@@ or of the investigations , Italian nationals combined with regard to Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on the 27th of May in hips , during which early morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , the bank account is likely to go to the bank account .
how den@@ ounces large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant lack of defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly gra@@ zing mis@@ sal at asylum procedures .
the representative for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has made a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country @-@ centr@@ alized register .
def@@ ici@@ encies of the registered data could be carried out at asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; in a analysis that the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; were referred to .
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people are recorded by foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
because the data have not been maintained enough , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become the German citizen , and no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ correct data input can significantly slow@@ down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics in statistics above the EU citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are included in the EU citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assign@@ ments led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a frag@@ ile debate about the handling of immigration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously has begun to return refugee families with under 16 years of children back to Italy when they travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Osnab@@ ru@@ sion Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and infants - from Italy to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the country .
the office now write : &quot; meanwhile the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy has submitted for the admission and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) keep these additions for sufficient .
other EU states would also return refugees in the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal affairs of the Lin@@ ks@@ fra@@ ctions in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are thre@@ aten due to the def@@ ici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a haz@@ ards of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was employed for other people at Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
at least of the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday .
at all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his now 100 donations , has now grown to 50 litres of blood .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , as our body is created and we z@@ oned the don@@ ors to make their own blood for strangers , nor un@@ certain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explan@@ atory of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken into their constitu@@ ents .
for instance , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time , corn enb@@ acher reported from the actions that were carried out in the Spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ district managers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the down@@ turn of inflation have ste@@ amed over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) voted in 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with this month fewer members stim@@ ulated a rise , as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its fourth annual inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and expected to continue to 1.6 % for 2018 , whereas inflation in the fall is expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they signals that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ xit and said that the credit costs may possibly rise more than expected to reach financial markets .
the members also voted to rec@@ la@@ ze part of Mamm@@ ut economic packages that was published before a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide budget funding for banks , although it was said that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real@@ income of households continued to use consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary than the markets are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank however emphas@@ ized that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast for this and next year .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound dropped to these news from the dollar and the euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound was dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.@@ 11 .
the decision to no change comes after the most recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have increased the increasing expectations for an interest rate and GDP increased in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering after the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households to be affected by increasing inflation and mar@@ gin@@ ous sal@@ aries , because the van@@ ishing is even worse before they became better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &apos;t prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it added that wages in the end of their three @-@ year period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be recover &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British quality , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds , which will compens@@ ate a part of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the coup .
the Bank estimates that it is likely to last four years until this will reach the prices and economy .
prior to the final judgment of the Bank on interest rates , the call was increased after a interest rate , because inflation increased its pressure on hard @-@ displacement households , with three political decision makers in July increased to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and it will come again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that its aims at a ratio of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to as@@ sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be stronger competitive , as the len@@ ders should look forward to shops and want to quit the year in a positive way .
the market looks very well suited for those with which the existing de@@ parts run and fin@@ alised the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with an extra @-@ free options and low yields are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) shall disp@@ oss@@ ess all of the HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will be received from September after a battle before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV prevalence treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ ex@@ positions ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with high risk factors by around 86 percent , now supplied by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for an estimated 10,000 people .
he declared to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court in the past year , according to which the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him .
on Thursday , the Chess train was announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first ones who will allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ positions ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparation that are taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP has significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection risk .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to the treatment in question , gay or bis@@ exual males , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not being controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are living in England and registered with a resident , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medicines in this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by emplo@@ ying clinical evidence as it is specifically designed to use and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention was to complement the extensive and increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of persistent progress in the making of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted to needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome you this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now must be found that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one who has an risk of HIV is left .
now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test Medicine was provided , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and delayed by the government after months of delay and delay .
the evidence show how transformed this drug as part of our approach to the HIV prevention and can end the transmission of these li@@ fel@@ lows infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designers tricks have transformed these small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I had shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have loved it in love and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a f@@ iller layout - it had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , great light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she instructed the Architecture and Design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings to make a home not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling wasn &apos;t big enough to place two rooms on each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative to release the submission .
&quot; the steel work is pretty complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were stacked on each other without having to g@@ aps ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just enough to build a simple platform but the steel so that he had the right height for the position or below the right height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make it longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
the entrance is mir@@ ro@@ red units for all corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains the fan of the steel rein@@ forcement , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s too important to push the door when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of room and storage , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agent will enter and create a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that provide the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not de@@ ar@@ est into the electric sockets in walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself through a good design and increased square met@@ ering of some standard in something completely .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate agent
two brothers have four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victoria worth over 500 million dollars .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business is to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp meditation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 are owned by more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Colin - was described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one third .
an act of jurisdiction says that Colin ownership is valued at $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be shown for Paul as a record point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left him by Colin proposed and left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed tours , the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held .
the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - where Colin , as Paul claims to have been excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul in front of managing some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , P@@ it@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who run dairy bars and delic@@ acy shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used safety to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood ar@@ ader@@ ship in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says that he began in West Germany when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in the year 2012 , hop@@ ed to continue their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers from judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other Brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lut@@ on Group , where Colin claims that mark was paid for $ 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made herself back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took home with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact .
only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain and compl@@ ain about our family names by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin made a letter to the Court that he tries to fulfil the demands of his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father did not wish that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still looking forward to a solution . &quot;
on Friday these hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps plans to restri@@ ct new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media ab@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried it and are failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first working day with senior employees , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he rep@@ airing : poor information that fights into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the employees to flow information about him - whether on paper or in let@@ ings - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by using its media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship goes back for decades - and now where he is in the White House , its television advertising is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was off@@ ended because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was able to convince a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it is under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter has ever been under control , &quot; is ri@@ dic@@ ulous .
perhaps these armed forces know something which we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would contain more ignition without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump not sent .
if his staff made it a few times to keep trouble from him , then their effort was worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump Con@@ tro@@ mp@@ sen .
a part of the problem exists that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material , which may promote their views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely busy with this history - reported on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ory information on the president of strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example that has been described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; recent and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump may react like a volcano on negative press releases , especially such with damaged le@@ aks , and that he decides to find out how these originate from .
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone responded to the President mal@@ icious a printed copy of Article von Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ alist Charles C. Johnson , who accused the source of Deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a heap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter because he has offered no concrete evidence or that he comments on wrong inci@@ dents and vo@@ ke them in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to question members of Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still its imp@@ ul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still under influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Win@@ ys Mission very difficult .
M@@ eist@@ y crimin@@ als will get mail from Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the presence of the population is praying and hopes .
the police in whole Europe was sent to this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als .
since the addresses of requested heavy crimin@@ als are not yet known , critics from the population is hoping to pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences would have shown that many volat@@ ile to vacation rentals , called it by Europ@@ ol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Post@@ cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; postcards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; postcards from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online subjects could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate on a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of West Mid@@ lands have again been negotiated with some of the trav@@ ellers on the war , which have passed one of the congregation drawn from the congregation to rec@@ la@@ im a field ahead of their manor .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a weal@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of tran@@ sports after they were cast out only in May , without being deported from the council , without preventing their fail@@ ures .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained un@@ handic@@ apped to find a path .
angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they were withdrawn on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they were thrown on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by switching to the implementation of the problem when dealing with the problem was us@@ eless .
the trav@@ ellers stayed there in May , were moved and are now back again .
more yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to move by doing a long sub @-@ instructions in order to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live at the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my community tax , if the Council can &apos;t stop this once . &quot;
a person who wanted not to be called , said : &quot; it is ri@@ dic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers to be pl@@ agu@@ ed by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and one has seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ ds said : &quot; we are aware of a pri@@ zed camp on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as quickly as possible .
in order to support our rein@@ forcement collection , it is very important that as many people are a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we put our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof Palace will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof with the then ambi@@ ance of operating company mbH on April 13th , 2014 , about 30 000 nights were lost per year and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rising numbers of refugees , which came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which was responsible for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an area plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all the Freu@@ den@@ thal Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and spoke of the interested parties to the house at that time .
he was right to keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ hotels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ers has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ ez@@ ers and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier hotel Birken@@ hof has already been standing construction container in front of the entrance , and when the house enters the house becomes clear , what extensive renovation work will be carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to the part , old bath@@ ers from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a beautiful hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with spacious showers , the entrance area is designed , new windows can be installed .
everything that might be &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; might be close to , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is stra@@ ight@@ forward .
&quot; we want to make a gem . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
located at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , they are already looking at a higher inner level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are spread broad@@ ly , discuss the more .
both individual resorts , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so much .
the performances of the city are cover@@ ings with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not be able to set itself exactly .
just under one million euros , it calcul@@ ates .
external services are also placed on the front , which is clearly visible .
in an inner courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open publicly accessible from the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; the Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special In@@ dic@@ ator puts Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , a special report by Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have launched a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
over the past few weeks , the Panel recorded work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to the right .
the newspaper appro@@ ves the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CNN broad@@ caster CNN reported that there was already first pre @-@ lad@@ ders of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence acc@@ uses the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted to have targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are to be established in the election campaign as consultants of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also received more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ cian Tr@@ ump personally signed into the centre and for@@ aging the accus@@ ation , whether the president is ob@@ struc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to test this evidence in possible fail@@ ures and decide whether it should be charged .
the Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Pro@@ secution .
mostly they are switched on , when it is about bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to advance individuals to the company under oath .
according to the Sender CNN , pre @-@ lad@@ ders have already been exhibited in turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting , be called upon a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps Advis@@ er and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
however , it must not inev@@ it@@ ably be called that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ um of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; feel good because they can &apos;t have anything else to talk about that . &quot;
his special advis@@ er to T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but this is also working usually in the secret , he stressed .
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special era in &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the President .
they have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the statement .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of these ass@@ roots , accus@@ ations were no@@ isy , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump said to have asked him a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is due to the study of large pressure .
after the representation of US media , the White House gathered material to the special mer@@ chan@@ ter and its employees .
this dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller shall be released .
unlike an independent special edition of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air , Richard Nixon &apos;s Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired at the in@@ sist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators issued two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators , after which the special event could not be released so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a giant ice@@ berg has solved a giant ice@@ berg of barely seven times the size of Berlin .
this shared the Il@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the weight of a trillion ton weight and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of great col@@ oss leaves from the north and probably will need two , three years until it melted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ic@@ ulture who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
to what extent , climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear after research .
however , a series of unusual pieces of iron drops in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a facsimile background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
now , the col@@ oss@@ ess Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shooter .
chocolate bars floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
thus it grows into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ eon is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this sh@@ ank was the balance of wa@@ xes and break distur@@ bed some years ago .
a complete shot was broken there , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is much to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C bub@@ ble are in danger , because the front edge has never moved far as far as at present .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate stand up and can be broken down , if at a key point you can break a piece .
the melting of Shel@@ ter and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level not when they swim on the water and ur@@ ges ice as much water as it gives for the melting itself .
however , the loss of the fe@@ ather leads to the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C bar@@ ri@@ ck@@ les is the fourth biggest sh@@ ading of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural happening and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists may be cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ch@@ urch@@ ins will rise again or fall in the long term , and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though this researcher did not return to climate change this gigantic ice haven &apos;t fall on climate change , but in the past decades , however , very many ice sk@@ ies are broken into the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
this long crown of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme of British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined about 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated in the past 50 years by around three degrees and count towards the areas where the temperature at the fastest increases .
CD@@ U wants to be at the staff at staff
because it is always difficult to occupy freely @-@ ending positions , the CD@@ U , coming out of the employers to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the cra@@ yon has gone up 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought .
there were about 620 applications to be recorded in this year .
nevertheless , the circle l@@ acks personnel to handle the increased requirements and tasks .
currently there are no vac@@ ant positions at the district M@@ ett@@ mann as far as 50 .
among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U aims to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG &apos;s initiative and join the administration of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the request of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development will work . &quot;
the aim is to cover not just short @-@ term evidence of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the candidate scar@@ city .
the overall concept should show inside and outside , specific measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this is already listening to a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems they did not know before .
other towns advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this comes with a high number of employees to put the disease or age @-@ condition@@ ally from the service .
so the time to act so that no longer vac@@ ancies remain un@@ occupied .
however , Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he already served as a surprise for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly posed the number of employees publicly in question and the rest of the parties flour@@ ished .
people want to be reviewed that all the possibilities are checked , enabling one exit from the municipal employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here , the county administration should aim with the unions - maybe in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - a pet rate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is attemp@@ ting to pay the CD@@ U , employees and officials to pay more than the tariff agreement for the Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , enh@@ ancements or more money , only if you are changes in a higher level , oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle has increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be arranged in which employees have to take care of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy deep@@ ened the tone to NGO &apos;s migrants
in Italy , NGOs who use lif@@ egu@@ ards for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not able to continue with new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs have no new Code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ n@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos;@@ Youth R@@ ican &apos; because their crew had collabor@@ ated effectively with men &apos;s hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which only has been in operation since one year , refused to express itself into a detailed pron@@ unci@@ ation of the Italian state of Ambro@@ gio cartoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains our top priority for us , so we are very sorry that we can not operate in search and rescue zone in the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge any alleg@@ ations which are currently raised , after we collected all the information and jud@@ ging the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; youth R@@ ican &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew can be delivered directly on board , which can be delivered directly from human hands , so that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the state of State , whose contents of Italian media was published .
the crew is suspected to impos@@ e over the authority of Italian coast guards who monitors lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ i@@ fs .
under the code of conduct , boats have to have used boats as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , above all , an Italian police officer , who supervised their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been declared so far as to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but accepted as they would have no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize winner for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants who came after the rescue measures in Italy came in the past few weeks to strengthen the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal defence and cooperation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month of economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ ge and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine W@@ eil@@ ers Bik@@ er , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner Hub &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three friendly Gu@@ ides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out as a good starting point for tours .
the castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour went on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , of which one could see far beyond the pl@@ aster forest and the stored levels .
there was always longer announ@@ cing for the long time , for the long time .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , view point out to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
there were many al@@ timeter in the last two days .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and confin@@ ed h@@ uts brought will@@ ingly breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ m@@ ted the bi@@ kers in the free@@ u@@ ft@@ in@@ hal@@ orio healing .
Neustadt has also been controlled .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga lists for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in future before computer consoles , rather than swe@@ ating through wind and weather during the stadium on stage ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long been become an increasing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gain .
these also have known the first federal states that are increasingly committed in this area .
in the beginning of 2015 V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport division in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to insp@@ ire a brand new target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Board of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this train still get some injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; organized by the Gam@@ er of various clubs in London .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football is especially considering the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , the young people still walk into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : temp@@ ting , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sport athletes , one could be present far more often on these markets than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ atic League to Asia .
what is it about ?
at E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA @-@ simulation FIFA on competition stage .
long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen has long been established , where the professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sports art ?
for many , the performance certainly need to use .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ese also has dealt a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that you can also find a classic sport for example , for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping will always be a topic . &quot;
controls are heavily damaged in online games , and in the scene failed the structures of the classic Sports .
scientists also raises the high @-@ inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study of business consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 we have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments .
in three years , sales will be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football @-@ Bundesliga , this is a little bit .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball , or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA where Ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports Car provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things in Europe also does .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as a class@@ room , says F@@ stro@@ us .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer team @-@ league @-@ clubs according to D@@ utt has now been obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison to Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B executive board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clari@@ fy , is not enough anymore .
it is therefore , to keep the tradition of the association , but the company is based on the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digit@@ alised world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t hold fast that only when football remains so , as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts that Conrad Roy to suicide , condemned
a wife from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was convicted in June because of the murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on July 13 , 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; My family is un@@ comfor@@ ted .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both they suffered from a psych@@ ic illness .
dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream colored fl@@ use , Carter standing with tears in the eyes , folded in folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has said the lawyer in judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make their own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
an attor@@ ney read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy who told that there is no day in which I am not the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to be proud of me , and how I am proud of everything . I try , despite all my pain that we are going to be with us for eternity and to be there for ever , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was persecuted by the knowledge &quot; I will never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this one person to have been together with whom I was together for my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a right preced@@ ent as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime committed to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention when Car@@ ters essays had revealed that she encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on , spring of a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she sent in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What@@ soever you have to do is put on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press from the case .
the case is shared the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter defended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow worker in Italy before being acquitted on two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was the captain of the Audi Cup as captain , no coincidence .
the FC Bayern sa@@ wed to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation .
something was otherwise on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional clothes piece very small was very small .
but because far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel New was to be seen , he made his split Bin@@ de in the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could define the sign from the coach , too .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was in the youth playing , de@@ but@@ ants , and just out of the professional professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he .
sugar is distributed at home to those who want to be given a lot , which one wants to keep at La@@ une .
those who have to get out , the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a little extra @-@ motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old became a mini @-@ lame on the field .
on the right side , that is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did their rest .
and in all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start information as the one that the ru@@ der can also take in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to guide the un@@ used tro@@ upe .
he had the view to the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal therefore , to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil go out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus failed to drop in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
that was very well done .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y went to the defense , both well superior .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm did very hard , in addition , the South also tried a few times in the game body .
his colleague Rud@@ y was saying that the result was &quot; not so as we hope to have been hoping for . &quot;
but also he showed an ordinary achievement during their debut .
playing Siege , speed change : &quot; I was also brought to this style . &quot;
as un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ world still for new entran@@ ces , one looked into the game .
Rud@@ y for example was not one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed away after a few cra@@ cked statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard from the South an interesting set : &quot; what &apos;s going on , I already noticed .
in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ gra@@ fted minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than one year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and ad@@ joining the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the largest sol@@ st@@ ice look at Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the priority list of the country .
still this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning setting , until 2021 the building is expected .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Coast of Trier , which is in the pre @-@ urgent need of the Federal Traffic Plan .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , Trier , is stim@@ ulated by Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to build an own company , the I@@ HK .
the Trier Handwerk@@ skammer Trier is an additional inc@@ entive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
the forecast is provided by a premium of 1000 Euro for the compound master examination and 2500 Euros if graduates within ten years after the master education .
however , the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , we will be able to create facts , at the same time there is the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Bell auer , chief executive of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , which you want to take mobility in the state of the state , are now occupied only 29 positions .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U faction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the b@@ loc@@ ates , the land invested more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the field of skilled workers in the region .
ern@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band construction in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had evaluated the power supply to an I@@ HK survey only with the 3,4 rating .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and break@@ ings .
ex @-@ economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they were back home after four months due to in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it would offer the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more intelligent options are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constra@@ ints &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located to provide or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules of carbon emissions .
nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles sold out exhaust gases are also going to make it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ old devices to regul@@ ate the regulations when a car has been tested , but with normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused of having installed a system to handle emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the study could be heavily loaded with Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately higher to profit from Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ igh@@ te@@ es and laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published cartoon character set , the bu@@ sters of his figures are its trademark .
even with 85 , the Argentin@@ ian is still working and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he smote himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for happiness maps - what they were fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following stations in Lima , New York and Paris ended the end of the 60s &apos;s breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
again , the artist inspired him to insp@@ ire the artists of cities .
great , ro@@ cking Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures are moving in drawings by the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
according to his own data , he still sits on the character , working day almost ten hours daily .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches are still finding a lot spread worldwide .
he has been working on a animation and a TV series with his figures for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a Giraffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as counter@@ player .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the chin @-@ wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he reli@@ es on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence on Climate Change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is rec@@ alled due to d@@ rought due to d@@ rought and due to the diseases of transmitted insects , scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effective , because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn .
this has imp@@ lications for the lif@@ esp@@ an of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the d@@ warf cave , and with very dry weather there is very many of them . &quot;
and it &apos;s a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also in demand for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant breeding with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE , and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered can be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of an journalists under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet at Wed@@ nes@@ days to check out their plans for coverage over the youngest chaos within the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what safer feel : they should take their children with the office which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room : ad@@ versaries , neutral , ally .
they ask the reporter , name for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and stomach feelings .
there are drug ad@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand at the government list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no rem@@ nant of violence , and throughout the country , there are more journalists there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto gave his post office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 standing after attacks and thre@@ ats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter you are editor and their aspir@@ ator by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in the context of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his missing is deeply impressed , even though its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , hung on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two reporter in the three @-@ 80s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry out T @-@ Shirts , which show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical pan@@ am@@ ity .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a son@@ der tor@@ ney was erected in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , this acc@@ ede to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , each year with drug traffic@@ king and organis@@ ational crimes are joined , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to handle the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ inhabited , even though the terrain is still tra@@ dic@@ ulous .
without information about the killer , without justice , the meeting of the discussion of safety was little benefit , I@@ bar@@ ra says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid , my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we don &apos;t miss all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15th May , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced from his car and was shot down for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the 12th river .
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on Val@@ dez theme there is virtually nothing to be silent .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in January and the extradition to the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as riv@@ eting fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey m@@ ol@@ een for drug abuse , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal zone with its valuable ports and drugs @-@ trading routes to the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken off that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions were contributed to the murder .
first , in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ Dam@@ ien Lop@@ ez , one leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ on fra@@ ctions held in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication makes the children off@@ ended , the gang@@ sters have purchased every copy of the output , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was to force Val@@ dez to force , after the preparation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to his own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there .
he was active as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he graduated with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of cour@@ age@@ ous and honest coverage , and the turnover and the advertising took place .
reporter loved it to publish hard tre@@ ading investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody can treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Prize for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ ing the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead them .
he voluntarily gave himself that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to keep alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffic@@ king in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ antic vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse like a harbour worker , a friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and Rat@@ ings , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite office , go and sitting there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine ?
his death also has forced her to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work on the best and remain alive in the life .
&quot; you don &apos;t like it if you are with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home starting and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cen@@ aries and self @-@ preservation .
to trust his own inst@@ aller@@ gies .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away .
the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ Real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are not in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative mu@@ c@@ s@@ mu@@ ters , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where people met from Ri@@ odo@@ ce to security training , there were suddenly no cell@@ phones allowed . days earlier was known that Spyware , which is sold solely on governments , was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
two police officers seeking the heat from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who have called the Governor itself as a tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug abuse are still under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
there were the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending which focused on the home town of govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a souvenir from the office of the State Court , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about how it was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so it was caution as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug retailers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the rainy Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , who ruled almost all the century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused because of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
in fact , Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; entered a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , we have seen what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to storage room for signs and stick@@ ers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ app@@ te himself a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ds disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western federal state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials reported , based on DNA tests , that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have become stronger than they have written in organized protests , &quot; SOS Press &quot; for walking and construction .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez weg in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spread journalists and bring them to the truth because they have told the truth .
it has since then asked that they are divided again by the government because she wor@@ ried that their anger has injured their obj@@ ectiv@@ ity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organis@@ ing crimes against government officials and one of the current society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters will not only be killed by drugs , but also on orders of policies and security forces , including the organized crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody has forgotten the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that allegedly signed by the Z@@ ub@@ by Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are beside her separated head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te at the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assassination of correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others make further , like El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly joined the drug cart@@ els with an article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their native countries , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , is that drug traffic@@ king is fri@@ gh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ ways before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ ming .
a number of shooting paintings with band@@ ry ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan &apos;s bathing area had left 19 dead .
the war continued , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the Bord@@ stein@@ kan@@ te you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed in the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ aps in the vicinity - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who had a guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can also think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the same day was murdered by Javier , the intern@@ ship was murdered on the road to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to soak up his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Rhin@@ o @-@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they even could determine that his shoe skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; awarded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; held gu@@ ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved condition , researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ge@@ ared plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada .
he met something , what seemed to the surrounding rocks out of the place , and decided to see more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expos@@ e the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy hab@@ it .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blind a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will come to the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or of arm@@ or , probably resem@@ bles a changing tanks , probably from meat fres@@ co@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide themselves from smoking , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute technology that is known as counter@@ att@@ ening , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts say what suggests that it was threatened by greater din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal , and it was Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments about his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the peak of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although it is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of the Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , by far the living animals , exceeds the living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs of sufficient pressure was hun@@ ted by meat to the din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of the con@@ frontation as a means of survival was favorable .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ently considered prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strong pan@@ elled din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ dents of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous have been to have been , &quot; said Brown .
chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his conservative Dar@@ mint , to find out what it has eaten when his last meal has eaten .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and went out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta were so warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original shape of the animal has been preserved , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of fantasy to con@@ struct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that stood on two legs , the earth went through .
although the king of them who lived ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avi@@ est monsters .
the scientists , whose newest knowledge appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta died after the death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ ified in the mud .
the creation was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was founded on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle until the hips .
the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ced from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ e@@ aters f@@ lowed through the western Canada until a flooded river is flooded in the open sea .
but the underwater fun@@ eral of the din@@ osau@@ rs preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin cre@@ ws are still covered in hol@@ esa@@ ws along the din@@ osau@@ r .
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ used it will be .
hidden remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ ocaust plates that carry the skull of the beast .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed over up .
I can count the scales at its sole . &apos;
in a th@@ under@@ storm : massage ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass vessel .
there are numerous injured , mile @-@ long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , the late morning of Thursday there were about 20 people injured in the late morning .
after the first data of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the no@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a wi@@ do@@ er about 30 vehicles , including trucks , trucks .
no information about the exact number of recent reports were initially in@@ correct .
it can handle mild to moderate injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ ter .
a large b@@ anners to rescue cars was at the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long retreat was formed .
like a AZ reporter , there was also on the opposite road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the mark of drivers of the vehicle that now have received with sensitive offen@@ ders .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between a car body and a car .
a rescue driver was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : the Group is testing &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing really sits in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ering .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes an uns@@ cre@@ st , or ri@@ ps the driver in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently performing the German road@@ map control .
you just confirmed by mobile phone that you can take its seat and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; we offer the offer , wide we are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of the year on many other remote locations in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway tickets without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use those , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what to do most passengers already .
it also has to have been bought via the rail , DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one gets to the train , the ticket will call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers a button to electronic validation is published .
the train guides will get a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the fried sitting area Y .
comes with the ticket control at square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already expected online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for rail , which is to use the passengers again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to travel without ticket control through our train accompanying personnel , check out the DB navig@@ ator easily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Executive Board by DB Fern@@ traffic .
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter into the individual customer needs . &quot;
those who are often driving , knows that in addition to delay and pas@@ sports the ticket controls are among the greatest off@@ ences .
for often , in any case , one of the trav@@ ellers do not need all the documents that you need for the use of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or the identity card must be displayed .
the consequence are endless discussions between tractors and road@@ works , which leads to worse mood in the part or greater space and del@@ ays at the end of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner will take at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not enabled .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment which she rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on her phone .
they stum@@ bled on a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child , and there is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conf@@ used when nobody had posted the information on her Fe@@ ed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on her tim@@ eline .
the rap@@ pers from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed .
he posted a picture of Bro@@ wns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body which was stretched out on the road and stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she thought at herself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for her and her community nothing new .
it took her mobile phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later on the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and by a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , who bore a shield with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ hop dog .
in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman his gun and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have used to us and which we are typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this moment I felt Schüt@@ te .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home on the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would take the next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and losses , the strength and power of resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , the two one conversation , that they had many times in front of this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to be sure to see and put it up and put it up .
it must be well @-@ developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even though I was lucky to give you an experience in which they do not experience an ec@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling I would give her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite to the police department , which was waiting for a camp@@ area , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined themselves with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared po@@ ckets and hal@@ ted them to demonstr@@ ators to demonstr@@ ators .
slow started to accept a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m has changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the company student nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black municipalities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it all has come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said that she and her comra@@ de Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to document only &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an said in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up their voices were not cent@@ ered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m of death at the death of death .
his commitment to Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after bro@@ wns .
&quot; this documentary does not anyone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on he@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is a community &quot; not for a Messiah leaders , but in order to unite the community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of pig@@ rel@@ ls are living as she loves and mar@@ ries their wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain haz@@ ard in this work and in@@ human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls is repeated the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identi@@ fying themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are fighting with different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , pregnant women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is truly maintained by a black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an active type of action , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell based on their identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ado@@ wed this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although she was at the front front , because with a life at this cruci@@ fix@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on disappeared , but the r@@ ass@@ an connections between the congregation and the police continued .
Fer@@ rell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social security atmosphere of the area they called her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she compl@@ ain about singing and she feels committed to this memory , since she went on road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
while the one @-@ bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be a real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or simply : &quot; magn@@ itude ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the evidence insi@@ sted that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the other shops , fear the opponent , that then the pedestrian zone is blo@@ wn out .
in addition , the gallery will be placed on the property , on which the peas@@ ant stands , in which 13 direct market products are offering products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery M@@ acher wanted to integrate a market hall in the new building - with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the farm hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady is very happy again .
we have discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the altitude of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is probably not low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping is in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ills or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
of which there is enough in our city .
yet you see how many cargo shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
because all the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producers and is ob@@ ese cheap .
as you see , Lad@@ der transactions are rented in a shopping centre only from larger firms , because the dor@@ man@@ ers are often not portable for a single re@@ ta@@ iler .
it &apos;s a pity , special business , there is almost no more and what remains remains , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farm hall during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in fact .
or is it possible to distribute all business from Bit@@ burg already before , or to distribute all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one doesn &apos;t need .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real estate market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farm hall there is no more space thanks to the mad@@ ness of many - as I find - sen@@ su@@ al building projects in Bit@@ burg .
when the peas@@ ant hall is cap@@ sul@@ ated , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates Por@@ traits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that depend on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ side and hair@@ style , which were sent to you by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ ser served a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence , having formed diplomatic news about the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition which opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline was united in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pione@@ ering Dis@@ sid@@ y , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his position .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the mic analysis of DNA , which was created by Mann@@ ing and made out of 30 portraits not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the in@@ tough@@ er determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born when Brad@@ ley Edward was born , but already since her pu@@ ber@@ ty openly spoke about the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , her painting was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ dient , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ine blonde per@@ ig - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette cheese and che@@ wing gum by producing the DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce a picture of it as those people could look like .
that was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her former M@@ use became un@@ equal letters that were exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic book by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Comic &quot; Supp@@ lies images , &quot; which had predicted a future when the President of Chel@@ ep@@ ka would be able to see and it were able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would require release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas so it was a welcome way of happy re@@ union .
there is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid sp@@ ouses , which he actually ought to keep away .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) is an end to the &quot; automatic cr@@ ushing , whose foundation family , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show through the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respect , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our Gen@@ ome is not because of what we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last passage in the exhibition , which is kept in a private room , is a page from the above mentioned comic Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a free release in the hand of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ask your speech , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never make the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the artist who greet her from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ th@@ fully when I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition still not personally - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the Mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ators who have joined themselves like hor@@ des of protests .
this was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , which were written with a pencil with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee at the University of Oxford for killing
a nation @-@ wide heart hunting is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford , who had been looking for susp@@ ects , after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warrant were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the actors of the District Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed away after several bul@@ lets .
a general warning system , published by the police department of Chicago , found that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ectives the stem as murder , while the police actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
L@@ ath@@ em has been a special professor for Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now ur@@ king in ur@@ ur@@ ly and was excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the relevant authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a speaker of the university and the Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to be found .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he needs the susp@@ ects to ask themselves to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a presentation of their residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help them to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that police received a call from the building ste@@ ward of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which has just received a obli@@ que tip that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police describes the scene as a very cruel one .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation about the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the op@@ fers and searches a variety of mot@@ ives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ A@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ A@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ filling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the W@@ A@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the W@@ A@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for recovery of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to give a concern for the cause of Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the W@@ A@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported findings by the W@@ A@@ DA by Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren for the alleged government sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation , because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that exists . &quot;
mut@@ tered words voted by Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report surrounded the controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ A@@ DA from the execution of D@@ oping control in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Organisation in Moscow in July , W@@ A@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nigeria , declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA move into the right direction . &quot;
Al@@ di sells no eggs more
they shared the company groups .
it can be justified by a pure precaution , no one could proceed out of any health impair@@ ment , meaning it was written in the communication .
from now on , only eggs are delivered to Al@@ di , which were proven to be tested negative on fi@@ del@@ ess anti @-@ sound insulation .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not be available for next U@@ ber
Amy deliver@@ er wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
even if you betra@@ yed an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers do not mourn the process .
&quot; there was simply never consisten@@ cy and obj@@ ectiv@@ ity , &quot; said deliver@@ er who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .
she has called people from the outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the Wach@@ sen to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing software that enables the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it enables companies to provide p@@ olls , special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used by companies to measure employees &apos; commitment .
salvation said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the sna@@ p p@@ olls and surveys from specific teams , it provides a heat @-@ card of the company , which shows most complaints and which executives can have low access results - so that you can be drilling , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have to remain the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee is a blog @-@ Post , who describes a environment of har@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , in which those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could own more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent mis@@ conduct and to recognize , saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converting has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t company makes tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; Sur@@ veys , confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hotline , which allows employees to report a bad behavior .
and if the chief executive leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is or@@ ly treated or in@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employees workers and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Conver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , said that there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of staff .
well , since the company Conver@@ ts , problems may have been hidden from managers who have been hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ lau@@ tern practition@@ ers - quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can closer to these holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began , eth@@ ics , values and staff engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of eth@@ ics through the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew that they were not able to prevent their dirty clothes online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , humans used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as service , and load the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who supported both start@@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , providing the entire capital to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting to expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inser@@ ts .
employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time to a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are glad to be able to feel their voices , and that the work you do , then you feel better to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ t and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach yields , when its portfolio companies are well run . company run well when employees are employed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise a third party , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a expectation that the change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments can breed and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company K@@ otter International , who has seen the company , who have left too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who doesn &apos;t want to worry , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now through monthly co @-@ surveys , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , to deliver them .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees she was able to organize more teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
in Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights over the staff , and it hopes for a long view that leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose humans , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose businesses .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it runs at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking to one side of the new exercise areas of the team on the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot tops and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this un@@ paid minutes is a lunch break .
players who are registered to the Summer Cour@@ ses are returning after the three hours of exercise , before they return to the Aqu@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 PM .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually renewed her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the players already fully packed seasons .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the brood joins the beginning of the camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises led through .
they are supposed to have 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal preparation for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ line the change of the N@@ CAA , even if they have the complex routes of the player another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lay this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply push it , they go on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we will have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will stop her practition@@ ers as soon as the camp is terminated , which is charged with the clear sigh@@ ting of its fields from a neighbouring car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class that has already had a protective grid behind a door posts , no easy task .
fraction players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a would have a problem as soon as those rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far enough to think that people can rent a room there and then go on to draw a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise of a exercise , it &apos;s a quite good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not doing so wor@@ ried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in combat against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send any more potential article with counter@@ feit messages from third parties and their results below the original entry , then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mach@@ ined learning methods to identify possible counter@@ feit messages , which may display the data check test from the original article .
Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so called F@@ ake News , of which many believe they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem is also become a major political topic , with which French voters were over@@ flooded in May with false stories , and Germany shall support a plan to be pen@@ alised after the social media networks , as did it not succeed , h@@ ass@@ ert postcards like before the elections there in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that , in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a review of the new facts would be started .
&quot; in addition to realization , which stories from fact , third parties want to be challenged , people want more to meet what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test in conjunction with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to his messages Fe@@ ed to decrease wrong news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p@@ ite for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and is now available to inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , an thermop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to watch the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on a archive : it wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter which was written by a double ant@@ agon@@ ists over the 1700 @-@ year @-@ old , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b printing !
and letters are still sm@@ elled after smoke , because there was a fire on fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as he himself would be there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who hit so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; to be honest : I &apos;ve got a little over@@ rated &quot; ) it seems to be too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to view the archives and to study the many treasures and curios@@ ities of the castle as they had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the territory and the ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with landscapes , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last ex@@ ams , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
as Rho@@ des one decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive , which he described as a &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ rates said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it in the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , represent what had been : &quot; it could think that land conflicts could be bo@@ red , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fought the two families .
guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to be spread to a wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves the newly built castle to join the peas@@ antry of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peas@@ antry began in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the Castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , the family of Dar@@ rell hid seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell dating from the 18th century will direct his own fun@@ eral as he filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was initially dug up later than his sar@@ g was dug ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be convenient and spending money back again , and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s hus@@ bands extingu@@ ished their debt crises , taking rich old women - I put them as a heap well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique write experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wildlife for a comic novel about El@@ adi@@ sh@@ mo@@ ki , behind the territory of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been returned by nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Mari@@ ental leave in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
the town of Bad Honnef last Friday launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday , the city of Bad Honnef last Friday .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will keep the logo and slogan secret by Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August , it should be the highlight of the campaign to give a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really think of course ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( of course ! ) it &apos;s not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; registered on their yesterday available website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that much better is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm belief that we are as a bathroom hon@@ e@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiv@@ eness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , there are more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a fundamental promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a central five @-@ digit amount is the city of Bad Honnef to cost their new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) reti@@ re from the officer of the Off@@ icers ( Y@@ as ) in Ankara .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is a routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the minister &apos;s office .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice @-@ re@@ mier@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defense , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the transition .
the government re@@ tains the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the marine were removed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the coup attempt .
486 people who are directly involved in the coup attempt in Ankara , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had been named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the gift , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but is Erdo@@ gan really owned by the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in late February , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general @-@ scale , there are Bes@@ org@@ ings because of an increasing &quot; Islamic army &quot; of the army , among others , in the raising of the head@@ set for Sol@@ dier , wrote the newspaper .
the Grand cleaner at the army and the security forces continues anyway .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan increased another 73@@ 95 officials , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
in doing so , it seemed to be an armed by Erdo@@ gan .
gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual lords of the country .
three times they kept on appeal to their role as a guard of the world leaders .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed forward the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan cast out a particular Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a well @-@ known officer , which sought after the coup attempt on fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it comes to , such development could not be cold .
anyway , there are no doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; said Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US migration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he looks prior to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for paying vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by the U.S. to change the way from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will be confident , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate track for racing transportation
ever again , over the past few months , over the future of the racing cars of the race track - now it is supposed to go fast .
even before the end of the year , the tourist resort will be built on which the tourist railway line will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to secure the future of the race course in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Ministry of Transport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the circuit of Ilmenau , the country knows mainly for the tourism important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Traffic State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
the country covers 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be matched , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the south@@ western railway as a operators are already discussed about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the timet@@ able , which are used for vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race @-@ Shuttle will be a regular service to be ordered on December 2017 .
the race shuttle is a popular railway line between the railway stations of Ilmenau and the railway station .
during the past few months , during the course of a pilot project , the distance of sufficient many people was used to order them in the future .
the route is also strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we ought to worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the ey@@ epi@@ ece of the robot , its form of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people are talking about it funny , but the companies deliver any amount of it , and we will be able to see them more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone , which feels warm - with deliber@@ ate human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can adjust its robot also according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and you can select everything from the ey@@ epi@@ ece using the form of the robot through the form of the ni@@ pp@@ le to the type or colour of its finger@@ nails .
but it is still wor@@ ried , since many robots have to look &quot; person@@ alities &quot; who would look to a step@@ ford woman .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots using a silicone .
the real Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling to , such as ti@@ ghtness .
and then there is still the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which medi@@ ates the impression of rel@@ ap@@ iness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - quite like real people !
she can be tired , fixed , or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties that suits rape , if one gets a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : ref@@ igh@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , un@@ quiet one most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just a different sex game .
its birth and its increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and low @-@ fer@@ ment in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes back to a desire after having sex with under@@ score as optional en@@ core .
most men do not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices their increasing popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ age out of the Rand@@ om zones may be in regards to the spirit of the time in which we live , very teach@@ able .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until they give permission to the free market .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robot in a time immer@@ se yourself in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House that he has attacked to attack women sexually mature .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The hand@@ held &apos; s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the handmaid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affects the un@@ paid body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it feels not like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots consists of a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as technically possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
her builders want to feel human beings that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ alities &quot; , the robots represent no real women .
they cannot separate or go away from their companion .
they have no medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing that could affect independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imag@@ ery tot@@ als .
differently : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human dignity .
it is become a binary of the tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political sp@@ ouses , which have polar@@ ised the U.S. voters , have also split families in small size .
around Christmas and harvest , there were newspapers in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to circum@@ vent with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relatives .
we ex@@ ert ourselves all of us to burst out our filter bub@@ bles .
less noted is the Power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es together .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has lived with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unity may have a mighty effect against a common enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , had been fighting for decades because of the policy , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
in order to find the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls in another context that this is also considerable risks associated with itself .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ill@@ ful opportunity that his cookies will no longer be cast off for one day .
however , there is another long @-@ time scenario to norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; once in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of confusion .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of leaving - the dog on the car &apos;s roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax expl@@ aining ) - which both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact , as a very mild offen@@ ders .
if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to Car@@ us@@ sell at Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York parking department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ky and the animals are turning round about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ iting music con@@ veys this to a strange manner .
so many lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are becoming old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I was still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage , the subject @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and have all have a great time .
if I would like to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody has asked .
on the other hand , I was obliged to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same as the option to purchase an average of 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but does not practice pressure on the server to enter personality in a situation that is not necessary .
the poor woman in the department store exc@@ el@@ ty , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his hand , which he suffered the prison authorities after a fall in his prison cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced due to murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors against an appeal by the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night in@@ sist@@ ence who hid himself in the cabin .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they were wise .
the National prosecution authority stated that they will be obj@@ ecting to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard in this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that its sentence increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel vehicles : which people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
you should improve the emission @-@ behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe announces ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the handmade software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates are only valid for vehicles who have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the Bundes@@ amt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but not yet called the exact date .
Daimler informed us to write every person affected .
if there is an inspection due to an inspection , this will be done in their frame .
how long will the modifications come across ?
&quot; hard to say &quot; means S@@ met@@ anin .
the connections from the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen the car manufacturers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far not act &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the conversion itself could last three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that drive no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will be av@@ eng@@ ed to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ prove so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but , in the regions where passengers are thre@@ aten .
in the rural area there are no value losses for older dies@@ els .
the ACE will have to wait for sale yet .

we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the place is already written - however , suitable applicants are ra@@ r .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been used for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors .
at the same time I ad@@ mi@@ red him that so far no application has been ful@@ filling the required profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time a architect or engineer .
so - under cont@@ emp@@ t of regular termination times - still enough time for a development .
since Has@@ lach was acting as a sub@@ contractor for the administration association as a sub@@ e building authority , the candidate must comply with corresponding inclu@@ sions .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if you cannot fill this out more , you would need to travel the citizen to Offen@@ burg .
but the city is indeed important to the city and itself , W@@ acker who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city lasting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is over the office and his employees sure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the remo@@ del@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park square are fitted .
the Kin@@ ds between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium san@@ itation is still subject .
the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
design is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ ch@@ master large game space .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ dener could be re@@ acted on a very flexible way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the creation of green plants will often sing pra@@ ising from citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye to do what it fits , &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the separ@@ ator champion .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end it runs on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ a@@ ier ( Building ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further creation of the city .
if you want to inherit Roland W@@ acker , the city of Has@@ lach should have completed a graduate engineer as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s specialist knowledge in the areas of construction and building planning law .
construction and civil engineering , civil engineering , construction planning , barbecue facilities , municipal office building with building yard and city authorities , as well as underground building authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines suspended : South route closed
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to police , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blue bike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) had been thrown onto the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ent freight for@@ getting had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male activities and look for the night hours after them .
close to the site were made by witnesses a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying method , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators had brought itself into great danger and also at risk of train transport .
in addition to the damage at L@@ ok and the installation and the late @-@ time car and the cost of rail transport , the rail customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south route could be led without disabilities .
almost ten person@@ alities were retired morning , two of them looked for correspondence .
freight freight fell not , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters high lines had to be exchanged .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and p@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meats , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation of the disease )
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory disease could be left .
the in@@ beneficial state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , causing Mag@@ ical mp@@ ses and ble@@ aches , recur@@ ring or blu@@ epr@@ int , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found by Prot@@ otype to develop immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that Immun@@ e cells are pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , who hide themselves in food , do not penet@@ rate the body .
cells that are able to destroy inflammation , are balanced by cells , protecting the tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium is til@@ led in direction of inflammation , it can result in a infl@@ am@@ atic disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance carry immune cell in mice occurs that a particular bacter@@ ium is placed in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of protein - to destroy the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ oma , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet toler@@ ate rich diet toler@@ ate less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ han , if the same system also work with humans .
the post@@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan is looking for a kind of immun@@ o@@ cell that promotes tolerance than they found that a group of study of those cells had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separately accommod@@ ated , this did not had .
it assumed that the difference is to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice became DNA sequ@@ enz@@ es and were found to have six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them lack@@ ed in mice .
mice were removed in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma and they did not get this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the Immun@@ e cells .
to understand how the bacteria results in the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow into a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on in@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
immune cells developed to toler@@ ate cells .
when the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ side were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ate cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i have found the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in gen@@ cies in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ uses can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
in Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der held its debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes to give M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve in front of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started the avi@@ va stadium in the avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .

&quot; three out of four , thank you for the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner to the sky
the US aircraft Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers into heaven .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
in the radar shiel@@ ds the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a st@@ amina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising previously .

new low cost for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns on : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still chief of the SPD , S &amp; D @-@ prime ministers must always be held with a certain concern after Berlin .
only no stor@@ er@@ fire from the party centre , merely a counter@@ wind out of the federal government - thus the most important desire of the election fighting .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , it has changed fundament@@ ally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus is watching the events in the SPD reg@@ ained state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind .
there were underground tips .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows more : red @-@ green is simply unable to reg@@ ain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprise @-@ president of a Green @-@ dep@@ uties over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the country &apos;s election , his red @-@ green Coalition lost its a majority of votes to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party Leader Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ mon@@ ed the tr@@ ign@@ ant Lower Saxony @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ akes to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear delay of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ akes must return to her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal Executive Board and electoral campaign in the Green Party Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ ed a SPD election campaign , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message took place on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ akes to the CD@@ U without their own government .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the failure began with the un@@ expect@@ edly defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more , cal@@ ming down the comra@@ des .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite was smooth the party .
comra@@ des , comra@@ des fell asleep again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit of Hamburg came from Hamburg .
and he came next to him .
mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus for that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he was doing so wrong in the crisis of crisis , making it wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ emission standards and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ Minister @-@ Prime Minister has already been in criticism of criticism .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe , in the past few weeks , Because of the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents in the covenant .
the Order of the former mayor of the former mayor of Hanover , his power to Berlin , remained hidden in the life of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him , because they spoke a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now , the exact opposite could occur .
because there is no gu@@ ilt at the party &apos;s part@@ is@@ oning , there is no gu@@ ilt .
and Schulz won &apos;t even exist .
at times , comra@@ des therefore ende@@ av@@ ors to keep his own ranks closed .
her anger is directed towards the green , and especially on the back@@ sliding par@@ liament@@ arians in T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and demo@@ cra@@ ck@@ ily like Mrs. T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets her own career of career over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mu@@ ier@@ sch , head of the Party left in the SPD parliamentary election , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ life@@ is not elected as a direct can@@ did@@ ature in parliament because of its person as a direct can@@ did@@ ature in parliament , but on the parliament of the Lower Saxony @-@ parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD parliamentary election , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony to the leading candidate in the federal election of the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career think of a future CD@@ U M@@ EPs consider the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more detailed additions of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ iers III
who wants to continue his home in the years , can get in the next support from the country .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g Urban Development at the Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler was still looking back a review of that previously happening .
since 1991 it has been giving it in Emp@@ fingen .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg have taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior design , and not only new building areas .
on April 4 , I received the information on the governing party of Karlsruhe on April 4 that there will be a san@@ ction zone III .
the total amount of EUR 8@@ 33 333 , of which would be 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community .
what is a san@@ ction area now ?
you will be able to further investigate if the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area at all interest , to renov@@ ate .
in the case , the area may then move into again again .
the Ste@@ g appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cell@@ ars presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; Social City , &quot; which would then be carried out within the framework .
core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ isation of Interior cities , improving the residential and working conditions and the infrastructure and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be objects related to property , i.e. per plot .
then the rehabilitation area would then be determined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2017 .
however , until September of this year , however , once again the data survey would be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire to fill out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December the sentence should be made as possible , thus in the coming year with the renov@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently stated that every community has to carry out what is said to carry out investigations .
it is therefore , to evaluate the urban mis@@ stocks and decide to decide when it is renovated and in which circum@@ ference .
for the respective property there will be also a san@@ itation included in the book register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to Emp@@ fingen as well as a picture of the location , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a major success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and may be completed by the end of summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and Basic Law , &quot; which is among other things around the building state and the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; allows information to size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill in the building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a ref@@ illing Question@@ na@@ ire is not at the same time a motion for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ screen Prin@@ ciples &quot; function - who first comes first , are the first .
you could not reserve a funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conclusion , photos of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project were shown to make a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a British inventor is the first in the country with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his house door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between Dau@@ men and Zei@@ m@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the promotional price of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the data of the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American builders .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , which was built in Connecticut , was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire fighter from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck .
the White House asked the presence of helicop@@ ters in a fra@@ gment order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before helicopter on the South La@@ wn , after the record of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of this , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Commander for Aviation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long stayed , until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight .
the original air@@ crafts remained during the event during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the period .
from the TIM@@ E provided by the recordings , it was not clear whether the second flight is required .
at Brands Act , the Federal Government decided to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked if it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; responded to the Deputy Commander .
the &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political top@@ tones .
on the event , the president was a violation of the reform of the health reform that was in the Senate in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to ev@@ ade government regulations .
the use of aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only to ask for a photo surgery is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February as the presidential plane before the background of his first battle r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is fascin@@ ated by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy pressing of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to impos@@ e the US President in the White House with precise Zen@@ th@@ ist@@ rates .
at the beginning of July on the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House in 58 exercise programmes .
the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter @-@ units flew in addition 11 hours to this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support com@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers have been the load for no other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain a budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ et@@ tari@@ ffs in the US Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D funds for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit reaches the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for operation of the helicopter are far below this rate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the funds is highly beha@@ ved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which include in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D does not contain personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former pressing of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ice , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week things , which will be produced in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that have worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly for so many Americans .
it is naturally reasonable to emphas@@ ize that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter inter@@ ag@@ ated when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat .
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can damage the OM@@ V
Donald Tr@@ ump not really worked on Wednesday evening his signature was put under the law for the disappearance of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his case , the Law was en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow also was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US pre@@ amplifier .
after all , the draft lies ahead of the European companies to help the Russians helping to build Gas@@ pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then investors the domestic OM@@ V , jointly financed with other European firms , financed the construction of the Russian Baltic sea line Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ al@@ cul@@ um is tremendous .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estim@@ ation of consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions yet per Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons will be available to him .

role of back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen hel@@ pers .
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed response partners for the children and a mapping for the team .
in the urban day@@ time facilities the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the care of food to the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back into their own self @-@ reg@@ .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of youth welfare , it &apos;s good news : &quot; we all have very happy . &quot;
furthermore , except house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh boiled cooled .
the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area of 46 children &apos;s sites , in 44 the children get a hot meal .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ Year there were 2,@@ 800 children at the tables and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ day at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children up to 2 pm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ al forces received from the 1st September kitchen service : they warm up the meal food , add them to the salad , raw food and fruit , Por@@ ters the meal individually , clean the meal , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as sevent@@ een institutions - decides about the ho@@ of @-@ gir@@ th .
&quot; the kitchen guards now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz is satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is why it works : healthy diet and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children shall help to prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force of the team is there meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - is done in the future of special cleaning staff .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that they have exhibited in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ar@@ ie and foreign for@@ warding for the city as the most economic development , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 Parti@@ al forces will be re@@ hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational area not so strong in weight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB concern on investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a union at the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie over long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company moved about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , including other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would be changed .
in a letter to the managing director of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s , &quot; concerns expressed that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be powered . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Duffy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win the principle of clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross as well as our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have been working here and the workers are strongly concentr@@ ating on local community and the major , Glasgow , a major pillar for human rights in an area with high unemployment and social security .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing economy cost and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly ur@@ gently need a floral production level at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokesperson from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ Manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that , since we estimate continuous commitment to staff and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are working as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and safe business climate , our business continually check - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La Liga might regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave her persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after spending an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve his free@@ wheel clause , but they warned about three years prior to the world record ?
the sensational approach has he@@ ats the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba to Manchester United last season .
after the completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athl@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G is offering wages of over 500,000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is angry about the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has led his way to outside the Catal@@ ans , although a source has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned of the PS@@ G Pre@@ sidents three years ago ?
when Manchester City has posted interest in the signature of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they want to touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will review their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign up one of our players , so this consequences will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems that this line exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club was interested in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G clearly did that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of their prizes for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ rows report not@@ ched Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows report on the abuse of abuse George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and histori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ bre@@ ch@@ sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ atzen ensures discussions on discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained to the publication opposite the German press agency , he ob@@ servatory by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ ald Pope Benedict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church , when Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have their deepest regret about their own sub@@ sets or their then wrong assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , however , critic@@ ised that on the coverage of violence against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ lei &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; level of magn@@ itude &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of the flu in Regensburg , no one knew that it might be prevented and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media mani@@ pulation , &quot; thus the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the well @-@ known Catholic Church as a source of all evil has been described as a source of all evil experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; one likes to go on to the church and this is a little fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , today &apos;s ben@@ chmarks for previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , the author and histori@@ ans Michael Hes@@ emann , who talked with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which was submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the declaration of education Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ vity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domain spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; so let us hold fast that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , physical and psychological power were applied .
precisely at high Emot@@ ions , the punishment for the pupils could also fall heavy .
however , in contrast to many others , many victims of the general crime of R. estimated that many victims were linked to him in numerous cases , despite the violence , even a positive memories . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ bre@@ wery sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger returned to his opinion .
Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence to Prot@@ ocols in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows &quot; gives an contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a lifting many students of his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
he also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ection , who has been a fla@@ vor@@ ful man , even if a domain name has no top performance .
how do you use this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you are doing the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all .
after him , eight pages are dedicated and it is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of Mitt@@ al or compassion on the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non@@ violence at the primary school took place outside of its effectiveness .
you may not throw it all , of which too late or first suggest@@ ion did not take serious enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eb@@ ym@@ atic school , which he had worked , was recommended by virtually all respondents than - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , describes it as &quot; hot @-@ zig , &quot; &quot; sophisticated , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably , &quot; as an extremely good teacher who provided the boys regularly with cake , cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always conf@@ is@@ cated by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority was compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotions , which also led to W@@ ut@@ ev@@ arri@@ es .
that he did not only threw the chairs and the key and the key and on the ground , but also stu@@ ffed boys to the hair or ears , it has already been added even before years , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used .
however , to his honour of hon@@ our@@ ing , however , such gu@@ ardi@@ ans were in the frag@@ ment@@ ary time , the 1960s and 1970s , have been widely used in parents such as teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also saw this in a sec@@ ular school , a state school .
compared to what it actually happened in this report , namely the abuse of sexual abuse and violence on the pre@@ school , are the free excav@@ ators .
here you ask , whether it is not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI , that many media just fell on him .
the Bavarian Pope did not work for many who have never understood it , still e@@ ager .
but the truth is : the report ent@@ ail Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot about the subject of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were reported in the media .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is placed in terms of sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse during the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said one of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ r@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the explanation of sexual abuse was and is that most victims from shame .
if they were not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , not one of the ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ rows students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no event , in which he would have had been right ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) .
I keep it ... also for really absurd to accept that around him ... Bu@@ ilt in@@ sist@@ ently or clear@@ er or clear@@ er , as compared to their parents , interpre@@ ters , teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the lead of affected pupils and / or their surrounding environment could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of charge .
so it cannot be charged to him , not prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contra@@ dict crimes , as unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read to read the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger domain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ look &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this approach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem , that in the coverage everything missing and dist@@ ressed to a huge mil@@ king from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that is again a mis@@ use of correc@@ tions .
there is also clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the gym@@ nasium of Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once , other pre@@ vent@@ ures .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the chor@@ age of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the whole horri@@ fic tester , the cases , in which boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been controlled and mal@@ toler@@ ated and mal@@ toler@@ ated , all happened at the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where truly sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to re@@ igns .
but with them , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eb@@ ym@@ our .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like most of the most witnesses , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eb@@ ym@@ atic school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. ass@@ ess@@ ments , and therefore in many cases , despite violence , even a positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
so the no@@ str@@ e remains at the most point to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the pre@@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish and from the predecess@@ ors at a school which he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) was nothing to hear , and then only again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut up the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eb@@ ym@@ nasium , which even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it refers to this that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exam@@ ining penalty will continue to be pract@@ ised in the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative presses , it recommended highly urgent .
this was , of course , at that time , as the legal clarity , was already forbidden in Bavaria as well .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , just as everyone knows us .
there was also difficult to estimate for him , where the affected might be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatically , and where truly the permitted limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have ever looked .
this is not true .
the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria only in 1980 .
Princess Gloria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger , the past to today &apos;s moral standards .
the prin@@ cess had already been right .
but this certainly does not apply to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ dic@@ ated at all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against in@@ exc@@ use children .
that is all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally closed .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its funds to discipl@@ ines and Pun@@ ishment , thus ear plugs and to draw on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also been kept strictly .
what is the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of obj@@ ection to language also ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells about his perspective , since the domain spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t waste that there was a str@@ ingent regim@@ ent there .
but also this has to be said : without these Perf@@ ection@@ ism , without the un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution from cat@@ ran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one makes no big singer , once a big singer and in front of every success , right on which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : with the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again experienced as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , low faithful and heart of good people , of which one could not imagine that he could only be able to do something from a fly .
I get regularly with how many former domain spar@@ rows still get in contact with him , 23 years after its Emer@@ itus , regular contact with him , read him , he is almost blind - and he &apos;s like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him till today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are than@@ k@@ ful for him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always is a good , good teacher - a str@@ ingent father , sure that may be - but also a loving resp@@ ect@@ son , to which they are still looking at today and that they would be seen .
and please , once again clearly : all what one acc@@ uses to him are gu@@ ardi@@ ans , which were at the time at the time .
we can be glad that we have over@@ came this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make a median sin .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obviously .
because the report , which was just released , dischar@@ ged him .
now the An@@ mar@@ ital status would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired large mer@@ its and perhaps , without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany , nobody would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace .
