<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards which change your look at the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners generate the first reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map coin promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nervous if maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to try out for an exciting way because the car Navi took place in a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the antoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but just so very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich site since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a ticking carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large oversight map, towns and municipalities are more detailed maps, so-called urine sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">These originated according to the Bavarian State Department between 1810 and 1864 and jump the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French forces went off at Lunéville's peace of 9 February 1801: today's neighbors who created the idea of an area-wide district of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Publisher management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The baseline for Munich is from 1856 and is found like all others on the Bavarian State Library on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The town expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 card.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map of the map, in 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Lower Fransendlings have been concentrating around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: in the zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "Urination" which was derived from the base tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots have no more farmers there - but small gardener of the complex" "" "Land in Sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green surface is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, which was the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Ural Brief man reads in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, not only the street name "at the Gasteig," or from the "" "" At the ventilation "" "" - but also in large letters "" "" Irene Anstalt "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road you once moved people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 in the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment of a psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and finished for example the chains of so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the occupations, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for construction of the Kreisirrenees in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesanum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked in a youth house with education.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the soccer field of TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built - in architectural rejection to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, who was destroyed during bombing in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was built in 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the department name was" "" "Kaufinger alley" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pits from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the breaking ceremony will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be liken with the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen of the Civil Code released for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the promotion of Farms has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminating politics and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Advisory Board, which will enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missouriards, as a number of fragile-based deposits in the last time occur in the whole state and will be noted here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted legislation of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, which aim to abolish the group to publish the itinerary, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights to happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are attached to their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as rampist violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the police from Missouri in custody without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which will be shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri," said chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring whether it should bring us money or the relatives to travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri was recorded in 2015 100 Hasselt, after the latest numbers from the Hasscrime-report by the FBI, which occur the state in terms of number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel agencies for Texas and Arizona after the States of Immigration authorities to donate people because of immigration to the ACLU's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel agencies are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately in recent years, stakeholders have applied the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence is Elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbach Weidecaun Project is a success project and is continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU federal government of Peter White and Kordula Kovac have brought a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right excavator of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisheracher met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwennmann initially granted insights into its operation, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as many young are looked after and housed in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldash" "" "is for him the alternative contestless thickets for the milk of his cows, so pidemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengthest comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the initiation project as "Elemental". "</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot grow on any steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space care for much work, a lot must be processed with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed pidemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elteristic operation and delivered these without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the promotion of promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers in the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare should be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that the breaches of the area could be gone up again for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thought about how they continue to continue their operation," "" "stressed by mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in critique for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area is 40 hectares, which cannot be discontinued until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of €71 was funded by the total cost of €71, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer stayed with 12 billion euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job, without farmers and women don't go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter White stood firmly for Peter White: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Association (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR projects are the precondition.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be bad (hangs over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the corruption.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 fishing fence, the application is currently running eight participants with 24 parcels which would like to build barely 16 km of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open surface area is about 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they start to attack statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully prepared overthrow Saddam Hussein's seat in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a hitous dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN's proposals to the drastic restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and Liberty-Imiters would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after finishing the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta are implicited: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but how he himself formulated it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the living response to the attentive words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your ways, your poor, and your oppressed crowds, who desire to breathe free, / the plentiful of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "poor waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - it was clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who have agreed to place their words after her death on the basis - did not know that they complete a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republics by setting up the women in a unused classical display depicting female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And in itself there is another name: mother of exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it long from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is that the Statue of Liberty is that the American flame goes into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh dropped here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception in the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in it to see how they were seen by the exhaustible, eldest, but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It goes in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and improve a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to know.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">Championship 2017: Neil Black, Scottish Members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two cabinets belong to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the power director of the Athletics Championships of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in World Championships" "" "is a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "black believes that" "" "is something special in Scotland" "" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and you think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics tics: it has something to do what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butpchart - who was able to compete against Sir Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is chosen from the team to team mate.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her surrender was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they are living or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh was quite natural, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete with their fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that "it is incredible" that 16 cabinets are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance between Muir carries on this track and placed five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rag.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another Scotsman, one after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannheim Convention says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their countrymen did not only belong to the team but in some cases also become medals and mix with the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing about his team capitals is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so there was a great honour for me, but to know that my team mates have voted for me and chose me something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the ots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It's just how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podium.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as captains in matters?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are in the Olympic stadium again.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go and compete, and it's just like to be a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: do not pay for a public office if you don't able to carry out the voting of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the Domestic Policy, until his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chimped in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of expression can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb we are led like sheep for battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who must work more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people, who sold their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union provoked him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governors dismissed the complaint as temporary, and the online comment was full of action with "Na," and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it is only Facebook" "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as primary means to connect to his voters and play his haareless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially called and paid by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defending Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governors and argued that the blocking of comments is no further than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the picture of trolytes or chambers or hassfilled people, which are online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people that have been blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments respectfully, contemplative and unprofane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not hassful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I said polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news program" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't know this idea, if there's a number of people on the same topic, then they will be misunderstood by some more than a so-called collective use, and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the employees of the governors as" "" "concentrated Spam-Attack" "", "others might call" "" "intercede" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut off a message by simply blocking a critics or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when one had done the same thing that employees were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical guiding and to burn and remove protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happened digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticized by Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County concealed the First Aboment, according to U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she has served a voters of their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers carried out between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter pens struck a lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trole.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised his position on the contract of Amity, trade and navigation with Britain, overwhelmed his position, according to historical documents which were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, freedom of expression and courses belong to our nation's basis.</seg>

<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible in principle, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes the wind power supply for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps plans to restrict new Chief of Staff to restrict the media abinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried it and are failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first working day with senior employees, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he repairing: poor information that fights into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees to flow information about him - whether on paper or in letings - because the president would make better choices if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by using its media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship goes back for decades - and now where he is in the White House, its television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was offended because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was able to convince a fair coverage of jobs," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit is under control, according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter has ever been under control, "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these armed forces know something which we do not know - that Trumps tweets would contain more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about tweets that Trump not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff made it a few times to keep trouble from him, then their effort was worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump Contrompsen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"" "" "" "POLITICO - entirely busy with this history - reported on the preference of advisory information on the president of strategic reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that has been described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"recent and former trump officials say that Trump may react like a volcano on negative press releases, especially such with damaged leaks, and that he decides to find out how these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone responded to the President malicious a printed copy of Article von Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocalist Charles C. Johnson, who accused the source of Deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter because he has offered no concrete evidence or that he comments on wrong incidents and voke them in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to question members of Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still its impulsive self, and his advisors are still under influence.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, a special report by Robert Mueller is supposed to have launched a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">Over the past few weeks, the Panel recorded work, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under appeal to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper approves the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster CNN reported that there was already first pre-ladders of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence accuses the Kremlin since longer, targeted to have targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are to be established in the election campaign as consultants of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also received more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post," wrote some weeks ago that the Sonderercian Trump personally signed into the centre and foraging the accusation, whether the president is obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to test this evidence in possible failures and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">The Grand Jurys are therefore also called Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on, when it is about bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to advance individuals to the company under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the Sender CNN, pre-ladders have already been exhibited in turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting, be called upon a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps Adviser and law-in-law Jared Kushner and his damaging election campaign Paul Manafort were involved in conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the suspension show that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work, and that he should be necessary to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not inevitably be called that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the charge of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremium of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic give the Democrats a way to feel "feel good because they can't have anything else to talk about that."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser to Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know about the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this is also working usually in the secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special era in "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">They have no reason to accept that something has changed, it was in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of these assroots, accusations were noisy, he did not want to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump said to have asked him a setting of investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is due to the study of large pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the representation of US media, the White House gathered material to the special merchanter and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller shall be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special edition of Congress such as in the Watergate Affair, Richard Nixon's Watergate affair, Mueller has a position in which he could be fired at the insistence of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1533">There is much to say that the Larsen-C bubble are in danger, because the front edge has never moved far as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate stand up and can be broken down, if at a key point you can break a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Shelter and Eisberg increases the sea level not when they swim on the water and urges ice as much water as it gives for the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the feather leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low degree, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C barrickles is the fourth biggest shading of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1543">Among scientists may be contested whether the Larsen-C churchins will rise again or fall in the long term, and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not return to climate change this gigantic ice haven't fall on climate change, but in the past decades, however, very many ice skies are broken into the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation'Youth Rican 'because their crew had collaborated effectively with men's hands in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'youth Rican', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew can be delivered directly on board, which can be delivered directly from human hands, so that the smugglers can be used, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the acquisition of the state of State, whose contents of Italian media was published.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected to impose over the authority of Italian coast guards who monitors lifeguards in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motifs.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats have to have used boats as the Iuventa, above all, an Italian police officer, who supervised their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been declared so far as to keep the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessarily, but accepted as they would have no "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up is the Nobel Prize winner for Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>

<seg id="1797">The lavender is recalled due to drought due to drought and due to the diseases of transmitted insects, scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shade of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what safer feel: they should take their children with the office which were the goal of an attack with grenades, or at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: adversaries, neutral, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug adgglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand at the government list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no remnant of violence, and throughout the country, there are more journalists there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto gave his post office in December 2012. 589 standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>

<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, each year with drug trafficking and organisational crimes are joined, the murderers of journalists are only rare in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still exist to handle the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uninhabited, even though the terrain is still tradiculous.</seg>

<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15th May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced from his car and was shot down for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the 12th river.</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on Valdez theme there is virtually nothing to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in January and the extradition to the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as riveting factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-storey moleen for drug abuse, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal zone with its valuable ports and drugs-trading routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken off that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions were contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, the publication of a interviews with DamDamien Lopez, one leader of the rivaling carton fractions held in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication makes the children offended, the gangsters have purchased every copy of the output, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to force Valdez to force, after the preparation of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues took that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he graduated with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars involved.</seg>

<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to publish hard treading investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody can treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria-Moors Cabot Prize for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them.</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite office, go and sitting there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced her to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work on the best and remain alive in the life.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-cenaries and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres VillarReal, that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, are not in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative mucsmuters, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where people met from Riodoce to security training, there were suddenly no cellphones allowed. days earlier was known that Spyware, which is sold solely on governments, was used for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two police officers seeking the heat from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who have called the Governor itself as a trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug abuse are still under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There were the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending which focused on the home town of governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir from the office of the State Court, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about how it was abducted or how it happened, so it was caution as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug retailers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the rainy Institutional Revolution Party (pri), who ruled almost all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused because of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In fact, Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" entered a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez schnappte himself a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalists to the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials reported, based on DNA tests, that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become stronger than they have written in organized protests, "SOS Press" for walking and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez weg in Washington and tried to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to spread journalists and bring them to the truth because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that they are divided again by the government because she worried that their anger has injured their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organising crimes against government officials and one of the current society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters will not only be killed by drugs, but also on orders of policies and security forces, including the organized crime under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The strong mored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from smoking, and used a parachute technology that is known as counterattening, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal, and it was Borealopelta markmitchelli named after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shady shady, a widespread defense method in animal kingdom, meaning that the peak of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although it is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of the Borealopelta, by far the living animals, exceeds the living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure was hunted by meat to the dinosaurs, the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival was favorable.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shady shady - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and violently considered prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong Raubtier behavior on a massive, strong panelled dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rodents of the Cretaceous have been to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red-brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his conservative Darmint, to find out what it has eaten when his last meal has eaten.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and went out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which she rented and scroll through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled on a post by someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rappers from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., was killed.</seg>

<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that is wild," "" "she thought at herself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was for her and her community nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="2030">It took her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and by a man who claimed to be his father's father, who bore a shield with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a bellhop dog.</seg>

<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder, which we have used to us and which we are typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt Schütte.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would take the next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and losses, the strength and power of resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, the two one conversation, that they had many times in front of this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "they remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we go to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take her away, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to be sure to see and put it up and put it up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well-developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I was lucky to give you an experience in which they do not experience an eclatant racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling I would give her a bad service to keep them far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at South Florissant Road, a place opposite to the police department, which was waiting for a camparea, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined themselves with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and halted them to demonstrators to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slow started to accept a new type of activism for ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the company student nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said that she and her comrade Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document only "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan said in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism of death at the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment to Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary does not anyone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me how these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on herells experience - to show that it is a community "not for a Messiah leaders, but in order to unite the community," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of pigrells are living as she loves and marries their wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain hazard in this work and inhuman beings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is repeated the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black Lives Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin, identified the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identifying themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are fighting with different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must bear the main load of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted to notice that" "" "the movement is truly maintained by a black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an active type of action," at the Ferrell based on their identity as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shadowed this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although she was at the front front, because with a life at this crucifixings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson disappeared, but the rassan connections between the congregation and the police continued.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social security atmosphere of the area they called her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she complain about singing and she feels committed to this memory, since she went on road three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size": TV-readers discuss a bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people, although it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation in 2009 the population in fears and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">It's hard on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no human being" (Siggi Bing) or simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the evidence insisted that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the other shops, fear the opponent, that then the pedestrian zone is blown out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be placed on the property, on which the peasant stands, in which 13 direct market products are offering products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher wanted to integrate a market hall in the new building - with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been selling almost every week in the farm hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady is very happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher's butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, arrives at the altitude of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but this is probably not low for the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping is in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drills or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which there is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Yet you see how many cargo shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because all the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producers and is obese cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, Ladder transactions are rented in a shopping centre only from larger firms, because the dormaners are often not portable for a single retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a pity, special business, there is almost no more and what remains remains, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a Markthalle doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farm hall during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or is it possible to distribute all business from Bitburg already before, or to distribute all the shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, no one doesn't need.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view, it would have been better to promote a real estate market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farm hall there is no more space thanks to the madness of many - as I find - sensual building projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant hall is capsulated, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that depend on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupside and hairstyle, which were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyser served a 35-year-old prison sentence, having formed diplomatic news about the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition which opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline was united in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering Dissidy, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his position.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the mic analysis of DNA, which was created by Manning and made out of 30 portraits not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the intougher determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born when Bradley Edward was born, but already since her puberty openly spoke about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her painting was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a gradient, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits on a driver's seat and a platine blonde perig - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette cheese and chewing gum by producing the DNA from the trash to produce a picture of it as those people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when it received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her former Muse became unequal letters that were exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book by Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Supplies images," which had predicted a future when the President of Chelepka would be able to see and it were able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published, Mannings would require release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas so it was a welcome way of happy reunion.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid spouses, which he actually ought to keep away.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with its oversized signature (the "i" in their family name) is an end to the "automatic crushing, whose foundation family, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological respect, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take away is that our Genome is not because of what we are and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective her," "" "Dewey-Hagborg" "", "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last passage in the exhibition, which is kept in a private room, is a page from the above mentioned comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she appears with a free release in the hand of the United States, such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they ask your speech, then they won." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "never make the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "" "she said the artist who greet her from Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still get gothfully when I speak about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition still not personally - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the Masks, from their own genomic simulators who have joined themselves like hordes of protests.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), which were written with a pencil with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"" "" "" "in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of crowd," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits." ""</seg>

<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said deliverer who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the Wachsen to help companies to find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that enables the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it enables companies to provide polls, special groups and demographic groups, and in some cases Whistleblowern allow C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees' commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Salvation said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap polls and surveys from specific teams, it provides a heat-card of the company, which shows most complaints and which executives can have low access results - so that you can be drilling, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture, you do not have to remain the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since then a former employee is a blog-Post, who describes a environment of harassessments, in which those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion, according to the financial technical website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent misconduct and to recognize, saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Converting has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convert company makes tailor-made "Puls-" Surveys, confidential answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS-hotline, which allows employees to report a bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has recorded the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is orly treated or inethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumers-boycott, employees workers and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted a problem, he or she had to submit a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, said that there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company Converts, problems may have been hidden from managers who have been hidden in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination, harassment or unlautern practitioners - quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to these holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders before employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began, ethics, values and staff engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethics through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right," that companies knew that they were not able to prevent their dirty clothes online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, humans used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convert offer your software as service, and load the company with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that supports the approval of Venture Capital Investors who supported both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, providing the entire capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, in view of the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research that shows that today's employees are expecting to expect more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time to a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are glad to be able to feel their voices, and that the work you do, then you feel better to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn which both Convert and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields, when its portfolio companies are well run. company run well when employees are employed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools promise a third party, commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about the employee's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have a expectation that the change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this disappointments can breed and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 discussions," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company, who have left too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow staff," "" "Have ye really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And who doesn't want to worry, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who is now through monthly co-surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, to deliver them.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees she was able to organize more teams within the company and to add multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company receives new insights over the staff, and it hopes for a long view that leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose men," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose humans, you will lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a sipite for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980 and 1980-1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Bewl River valley in Kent and is now available to inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, an thermophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to watch the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says," ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on a archive: it wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only responded to the thumb-print on the side of a letter which was written by a double antagonists over the 1700-year-old, who worked for the Jacobins," "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who hit so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle lived ("to be honest: I've got a little overrated") it seems to be too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, to view the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle as they had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the territory and the ruins of the ancient castle, and spoke with landscapes, gardener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, he drank "whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only received full access in 2006 when the last exams, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">As Rhodes one decade later, the employees began to worry about the archive, which he described as a "hundreds of years, in which Aristokrates said" Oh, wirf it in the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps, represent what had been: "it could think that land conflicts could be bored," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to be spread to a wider basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer' that leaves the newly built castle to join the peasantry of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the Castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons, the family of Darrell hid seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell dating from the 18th century will direct his own funeral as he filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was initially dug up later than his sarg was dug).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be convenient and spending money back again, and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's husbands extinguished their debt crises, taking rich old women - I put them as a heap well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his approach in the castle Rhodes in search of other unique write experiences</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyepiece of the robot, its form of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "the people are talking about it funny, but the companies deliver any amount of it, and we will be able to see them more frequently," "" "said Mr Sharkey on the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone, which feels warm - with deliberate human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adjust its robot also according to its beliefs "and you can select everything from the eyepiece using the form of the robot through the form of the nipple to the type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worried, since many robots have to look "personalities" who would look to a stepford woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots using a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot allows for example to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing to, such as tightness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which mediates the impression of relapiness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed, or it can be "" "" in mood "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the lower female properties that suits rape, if one gets a step on Frigid (called here: refighing) Farrah, unquiet one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it is on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just a different sex game.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its birth and its increasing refinement indicate a little darker and low-ferment in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes back to a desire after having sex with underscore as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakage out of the Random zones may be in regards to the spirit of the time in which we live, very teachable.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until they give permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that this highly developed sex robot in a time immerse yourself in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House that he has attacked to attack women sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The handheld 's Tale' ('The report of the handmaid') are not the graphic images that affects the unpaid body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it feels not like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots consists of a physical similarity to actual women so realistic as technically possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Her builders want to feel human beings that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots represent no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background history, nothing that could affect independence or anything, which could disturb the imagery totals.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human dignity.</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become a binary of the trump-era that the political spouses, which have polarised the U.S. voters, have also split families in small size.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest, there were newspapers in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to circumvent with the horror of trump-chosen relatives.</seg>

<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago and has lived with the Republicans in our family to visit me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity may have a mighty effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, had been fighting for decades because of the policy, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to find the dining table, this certainly is a good thing, but it falls in another context that this is also considerable risks associated with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the grillful opportunity that his cookies will no longer be cast off for one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is another long-time scenario to normalized in the Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized" once in comparison to his standards as the epitome of confusion.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of leaving - the dog on the car's roof, the 14% income tax (but at least did we know how his tax explaining) - which both occur in comparison to trump in fact, as a very mild offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is going, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>

<seg id="2443">The Central Park Carussell is still a strange magical experience, as there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and have all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I would like to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody has asked.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory disease could be left.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The inbeneficial state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, causing Magical mpses and bleaches, recurring or blueprint, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found by Prototype to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that Immune cells are patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes, who hide themselves in food, do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to destroy inflammation, are balanced by cells, protecting the tolerance and protect the body without any sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is tilled in direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflamatic disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance carry immune cell in mice occurs that a particular bacterium is placed in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the blocks of protein - to destroy the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet tolerate rich diet tolerate less inflammathan, if the same system also work with humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral prizes in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan is looking for a kind of immunocell that promotes tolerance than they found that a group of study of those cells had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separately accommodated, this did not had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference is to do with the intestinal microbioma of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice became DNA sequenzes and were found to have six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacked in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were removed in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbioma and they did not get this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the Immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria results in the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri to grow into a liquid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on inmature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Immune cells developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan Metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptopside were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerate cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known if tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri have found the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in gencies in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave her persecution by Neymar after spending an offer of £189 million in order to resolve his freewheel clause, but they warned about three years prior to the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heats the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG is offering wages of over 500,000 GBP a week.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domsparrows report notched Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domsparrows report on the abuse of abuse George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misbrechscandal at the Regensburger Domsparatzen ensures discussions on discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissenator, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the publication opposite the German press agency, he observatory by the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerald Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church, when Mueller and Ratzinger would have their deepest regret about their own subsets or their then wrong assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican Council" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand, however, criticised that on the coverage of violence against the" "" "two-lei" "" "level of magnitude" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In terms of the flu in Regensburg, no one knew that it might be prevented and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," thus the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the well-known Catholic Church as a source of all evil has been described as a source of all evil experience and prepares public opinion that" "" "writes Scaraffia" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio: "one likes to go on to the church and this is a little frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, they pointed out that in their youth" "" "strokes" "" "had been a normal pedagogical means" "", "to be done with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, today's benchmarks for previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, the author and historians Michael Hesemann, who talked with Ratzinger the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must accept Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "Hemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the report report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which was submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the declaration of education Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausivity" "" "victims of overprint, 67 domain sparrows sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "so let us hold fast that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases, physical and psychological power were applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Precisely at high Emotions, the punishment for the pupils could also fall heavy.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to many others, many victims of the general crime of R. estimated that many victims were linked to him in numerous cases, despite the violence, even a positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misbrewery scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger returned to his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence to Protocols in the Regensburger Domsparrows" gives an contradictory image of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lifting many students of his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">He also appears as a Choleriker and Perfection, who has been a flavorful man, even if a domain name has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you are doing the trouble and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">After him, eight pages are dedicated and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of Mittal or compassion on the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the primary school took place outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may not throw it all, of which too late or first suggestion did not take serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzebymatic school, which he had worked, was recommended by virtually all respondents than -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, describes it as "hot-zig," "sophisticated," "competent," and "understandably," as an extremely good teacher who provided the boys regularly with cake, cookies and Bonbons, and "always confiscated by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority was complained about his perfectionism and his high emotions, which also led to Wutevarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw the chairs and the key and the key and on the ground, but also stuffed boys to the hair or ears, it has already been added even before years, deeply regrets and excused.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, to his honour of honouring, however, such guardians were in the fragmentary time, the 1960s and 1970s, have been widely used in parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also saw this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually happened in this report, namely the abuse of sexual abuse and violence on the preschool, are the free excavators.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Here you ask, whether it is not more to do with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">The Bavarian Pope did not work for many who have never understood it, still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entail Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot about the subject of abuse during the Regensburger Domsparrows were reported in the media.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is placed in terms of sexual abuse in terms of sexual abuse during the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "" "he said one of the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the explanation of sexual abuse was and is that most victims from shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even parents and siblings, not one of the choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrows students Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no event, in which he would have had been right (Georg Ratzinger).</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd to accept that around him... Built insistently or clearer or clearer, as compared to their parents, interpreters, teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the lead of affected pupils and / or their surrounding environment could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be charged to him, not prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradict crimes, as unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "Nonviolence" "" "was read to read the" "" "Regensburger domain" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "overlook" "" "report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this approach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem, that in the coverage everything missing and distressed to a huge milking from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is again a misuse of corrections.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separately: between the preschool and the gymnasium of Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once, other preventures.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the chorage of the Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrific tester, the cases, in which boys of sadistic teachers have been controlled and maltolerated and maltolerated, all happened at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where truly scandalous conditions have to reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspatzebymour.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "it was like most of the most witnesses, the subject" "" "preschool" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzebymatic school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims of the general humanity of R. assessments, and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even a positive memories are linked to him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So the nostre remains at the most point to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define two periods in which he was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish and from the predecessors at a school which he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) was nothing to hear, and then only again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger shut up the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzebymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "it refers to this that" "" "the examining penalty will continue to be practised in the school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative presses, it recommended highly urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at that time, as the legal clarity, was already forbidden in Bavaria as well.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, just as everyone knows us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult to estimate for him, where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatically, and where truly the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have ever looked.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria only in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallacck of Anachronism," i.e. the danger, the past to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess had already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this certainly does not apply to sexual abuse, who was abdicated at all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against inexcuse children.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That is all very horrible and I'm glad that it is finally closed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its funds to disciplines and Punishment, thus ear plugs and to draw on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also been kept strictly.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his Regensburger time, Georg Ratzinger has played in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of objection to language also?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells about his perspective, since the domain sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't waste that there was a stringent regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this has to be said: without these Perfectionism, without the unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution from catrang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone one makes no big singer, once a big singer and in front of every success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: with the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger really well and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, low faithful and heart of good people, of which one could not imagine that he could only be able to do something from a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domain sparrows still get in contact with him, 23 years after its Emeritus, regular contact with him, read him, he is almost blind - and he's like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him till today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are thankful for him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always is a good, good teacher - a stringent father, sure that may be - but also a loving respectson, to which they are still looking at today and that they would be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all what one accuses to him are guardians, which were at the time at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcame this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and a more prominent brother to make a median sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Anmarital status would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired large merits and perhaps, without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany, nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace.</seg>
