28 @-@ year @-@ old chef in San Francisco Mall found dead
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said that he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would like to harm him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it was uphill for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the body , which was found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the court medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and investig@@ ates investigations on running .
the brother of the Sac@@ ri@@ fice , Louis Gal@@ icia , divided the ABS Radio K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank worked as chef in Boston , who had her dream job as chef in S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters restaurant in San Francisco , six months ago .
a spokes@@ man on the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter said that she sho@@ cked on his death &quot; sho@@ cked and destroyed the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painful , &quot; said the speaker .
our thoughts and compassion are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els , but that , &quot; the things were finally uphill for him . &quot;

Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could imagine anybody who would like to harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
his kind to associate with his family was to cook us always something to cook for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of meditation .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all that goes wrong in the world , it was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ ined every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ understand@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be plug@@ ged in drawers or get from the outside label , who with me and reality have little to do with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather car@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at that she explains as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the actress makes her time home , pre @-@ television set her time at home , front TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , says it in the magazine .
to white , they bring the question after the child &apos;s wish : &quot; we do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; is A@@ ni@@ ston as a single @-@ one mother of two sons .
the film will run with us from August 25th .
Gol@@ fers Lang@@ er gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er sought a little variation with some colleagues at the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden Sports pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the horses were remembered for their holiday , they pursued after the quick gal@@ lop back home .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and this ended the riding career then again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left his family over the press of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t hesitate to hide .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid reached the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala &apos;s Golden Sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards in the symp@@ a@@ thetic athl@@ ete .
Federal Minister of Culture , Silver &apos;s bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen already has bled him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the pyramid pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive commitment , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ times US master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard poison , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the jumping competition Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports enthusiasts came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ate company emigrated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - this would like Clinton as well as tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential elections , however , are in the control and energy policy as well as in one basic demand .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump , however , wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the state of the economy - with tax and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to rescue the economy and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
by contrast , he would be quite different , asser@@ ted Tr@@ ump .
he will return Reg@@ uli@@ arities massi@@ vely , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax sets - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has to open the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the weal@@ thy would be raised , says they .
both are very close to infrastructure .
the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ sen .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ party Te@@ ach@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on tr@@ ump there could be still part@@ ei@@ ving discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump will build coal power plants and drive the coal transport in the US again .
oil extraction is also to be possible in the protected areas in order to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement .
in contrast , Clinton wants to expand expanding renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only with infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the proprietary trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the U.S. do not want to ins@@ ure from international trade , but simply protect American jobs .
they should be better to be paid better , by Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump will do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage is down , then he says he could not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side , tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens , to stim@@ ulate growth .
his critics hold him , so that the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least of the weal@@ thy wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has gained experience with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone to flee to everyday life .
if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised .
a house has refuge .
four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby who is at the most one year old .
one has put their little son in the arm .
he looks curious about big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ red at the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she briefly sm@@ iles and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talked with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is a member of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social aid offers in Bavaria , and is involved with the subject of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Convention .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as a visitor .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here has made her own experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted , because they send acts of torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope@@ ful@@ ler to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced dis@@ appearances , hon@@ ours , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run the path goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you require a bottle of water for a bottle of water , no rarity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here , the women in refugee @-@ under@@ lining would often be regarded as min@@ der@@ ous and worse .
this is that about 90 percent of women who live in the property in the Munich north , it is estimated that it is estimated .
&quot; some of the children are not optional . &quot;
many women be so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly about the people , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not need to assist , there are more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district leaders are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they w@@ ished from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction area , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there are something in accomod@@ ations of governments .
in Schw@@ aben , women will not be shel@@ tered separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Press@@ ure of the Government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , underground and mid@@ fran@@ ken , there are floors or private houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study published in the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are being separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it may be too - persistent - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower rooms should be easily accessible , and for women easily accessible , is in the study .
as much the women to feel this protection , one can read the And@@ ur@@ anium , which is located on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since she has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : claims according to new labour measures
deputy representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute concerning a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire council to appro@@ ve more working measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it was Minister to agree on the wor@@ ries regarding the contract .
assist@@ ants and medical inst@@ ants have agreed on the re@@ jection of a contract that agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC @-@ Ellen Court said that the government had remained quiet &quot; related to problems , what led to that the Treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the J@@ DC board , the proposed new contract to complete the proposed new contract , and the official re@@ eds to all of these are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today issued a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a long @-@ lasting programme of working measures that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the dispute that Assist@@ enz@@ arians strengthened this year six times , the first overall sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A assistant , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the agreed contract of the agreed contract that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical inst@@ ances that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt , said that the contract for doctors would be forced to be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that finished a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I can not resist the pressure that Ankara will love them most .
there was the blow , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked nar@@ ro@@ red and it radi@@ ated heat , even for its back conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan is repeated by his &quot; love &quot; Putin - according to a whole five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so much worse than it would never happen .
I seemed to suggest its enthusiasm rather the opposite .
but one of Putin radi@@ ant sustainable kis@@ ses showed that the Russian government of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first , which he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow was reaction to the time in Moscow .
Putin was divided and accused Ankara , Russia in the back .
the leaving was even bigger , since it was celebrated by a thought friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ wing again will be difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
when it seemed , the Turks were to blame for everything .
the alleg@@ ations of senior officials to have benef@@ itted that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family could have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria , who will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the withdrawal of Erdo@@ gan of President Erdo@@ gan who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
the advantages of an ar@@ mist@@ ice are clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed to get all friends who can get a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his Am@@ tes during the last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey brought him also sha@@ ken him .
but there are economic mot@@ ives .
Russian sanctions are hard to hit Turkey - in particular the ban of bat@@ ches that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel organizers and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be resumed .
they count on a late seasonal p@@ ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television projected fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , since its response to the attempted power of power was regarded as weak response .
for this purpose , the persistent G@@ roll take over the snow@@ fall of the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - that is er@@ ecting to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian state of government won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara with security that , after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow not@@ ices a self @-@ understand@@ able , which itself has a deeper fear of regim@@ ent .
the summit in this glorious palace made it possible by Russia and Turkey , one , as it described me a analy@@ st to present an alliance of outer side : two countries that feel away from the West and feel bad now .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages .
it could be revealed that after almost three hours of the first @-@ discussions both pre@@ sidents responded to the press conference that they had not even stri@@ ped on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey denied it to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus that can be found in Syria , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found .
but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to more on a Back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has been dist@@ anced since then when they had to be saved and saved nearly eight years ago .
in this time brand str@@ ate@@ ways &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial brands .
it supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the six Nations Rug@@ by up to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the central headquarters and the stock stock market will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller stamps for private customer business to get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan has been interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be employed by our investment brand as well as to the brand , under which our employees will be busy , since we will now become more at a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but local goals .
each of these stamps are in their own municipalities for something completely different and our staff will work among these stamps with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ship and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop the bank &apos;s bank , for how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our clients and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can again launch this brands again , so I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved his 3,@@ 000@@ th profit in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ten profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race course with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat races .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori who won previously on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I am landed here 30 years ago .
there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am facilit@@ ated and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the joy when he picked up the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who hit more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ys@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modern and it is no surprise that he reaches this milestone , which only reached a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct , which differs from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma fans have been thrilled for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie from some weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 win@@ nings , if he was not only a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey would be !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winner , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone in a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the British flat @-@ racing for two decades .
it was ner@@ ven@@ ous .
a whole series of big tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
he had the beginning three years ago when he returned from his six months of Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ struc@@ ted his two fl@@ ashes and return to his shape .
and yet he is not yet alive at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori previously said he wants to continue with competitions up to his least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years .
Russian Putin fired Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
the Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the Chief of Staff of Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as Chief of Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy in Tokyo .
it is on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of the head of the government of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of government to support your activity as a state of Chief of Staff and insp@@ ections to the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious sc@@ ars .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time one of the most eng@@ aging of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so , here is the result of a kind of power ?
no one knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , who once was ordained as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin who are cited on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated position - one could almost say - for a position to trust four years .
as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V participated in the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ on@@ ary Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed to the K@@ GB , the IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , whom he trusted in most .
once again , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was adopted into Putin &apos;s second term in Putin , as a third ten@@ ure of Putin would have been cast against the Constitution .
but this item was taken from another , near allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he returned three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved last month at a physical meditation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his notice in a common opinion .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent against Aaron Hot@@ ch@@ ner , was publicly released on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation .

Queens@@ der@@ Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ ar Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - what does that the bridge is connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ments of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 shells .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the construction Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and one of the first to come from the country on the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ar Cros@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of a engineers from an truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the bridge between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity which require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of all bre@@ ads are at their place and the last section of the de@@ cks today gets in Ros@@ y@@ th a bed kiss for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
at this fantastic project , the closure of the ground@@ breaking high and deep structure represents .
after installing the last tram@@ way section and its connection with which in the expansion of the north tower we had to close the existing gap on the north or land .
this was reached by pulling the northern train bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6,000 tons weighs and at an incline of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
the toler@@ ances , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side , it was only a few millimeters .
lu@@ ck@@ ily everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of her fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had trouble swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around , and introduced us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat except their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found on a bu@@ d without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of the coastal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have been wounded , and to be still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine had a not@@ stop@@ one , but it disin@@ teg@@ rated by the person of the boat from the person who ste@@ ed the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened over these men today .
heavily viol@@ ated - man st@@ alls on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and injured .
as the police ha@@ sted yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to get his personal things .
instead , the Algeri@@ an perpet@@ rators instead cut out the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when this came into the apartment , he moved twice on them .
the 44 year old was wounded by the hand and by the body .
the police tried the perpet@@ rator .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ armed therefore became his sister .
together with their life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women once again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to his side and took his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ ly cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and greetings mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors are expected to be stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respon@@ ding to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next years almost 1300 cheap apartments will lose ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action plan living &quot; for the next time .
but the dispute is programmed .
the first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are invited to the Green Party : those who want to build on urban areas have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance .
however , the great issue of the city hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build up to private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such land at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as a social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new residential building project , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules .
the left still wants to har@@ ness for investors .
regardless of that , so Brat@@ mann , has a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
the action plan is implemented , which ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the specialists .
but the program does not stand completely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments that are supposed to be built @-@ in .
but how do you compare the loss of some 1300 inexpensive apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning company Nicole Palm , which should now be purchased from the city now .
in addition , it would have to be thought to be back again in the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
solve the problem to a blow .
because in the West city run the end of the year at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner , the residential property companies .
because the number of social dwellings in the west town is again dra@@ stically increased , one removes away from the target of so @-@ called passage .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in only a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens rec@@ alling that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teen@@ ager and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to spend their leisure time , was be@@ aded in the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not include any other on each other .
I &apos;m leaving me on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market introduction in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smart phones outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ ced with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person back every day .
cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by a app for Apple Watch the Washington Post announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase output .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes of time to get &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and every day active to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat on deaf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and are coming from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be assessed .
those who drives regularly Sport , reduces his chances to kill cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that they have fun .
thus , three pillars of the health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are m@@ ack@@ rical game destro@@ ys , who always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it do ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier succeeded to follow our activity , they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game .
the New will lose its appeal and use the use of time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in women
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic at the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ fight titles and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; man @-@ man adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es continued on the pig bal@@ ken during the single multi @-@ struggle of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who wins a multi@@ fight , and a total of the fifth , while it soli@@ di@@ fies to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , which brought its sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years their sports art domin@@ ates , 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on of her said that she has ever seen &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast ever I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a last trial in Brazil , a competition that went not so very between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .

although it insi@@ sted on the top of their long way@@ mark on the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ ble Pass - is tailored to Latin American music , which would be at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not acci@@ dental .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a training course in the gym in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more multi @-@ competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which will take as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two rot@@ ations slightly , the image f@@ lowed .
Swe@@ des and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which it holds the world championship title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she returned to the pig again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig and sat down on the floor with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man um@@ im@@ pover@@ ished they gently than they had expected their end - a pure form of form@@ ality , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , than the vision that they were once described in their collec@@ ti@@ book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago , when she fought around the third place , but the bronze medal was in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams had called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; which is called O@@ ma .
after their ground practice , she threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes was dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as is concerned , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old 19 @-@ year @-@ old became a very new meaning of the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in series mur@@ der@@ ers shot during music listening in the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the fatal attacks since a decade in the first series of mur@@ der@@ ment by Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked when the car was par@@ ked .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire weapon , while it stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not have been the result of a room of space , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of an adult victims .
in Jonathan Howard S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the investig@@ ator has led the investig@@ ator to see a close look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven persons were killed in nine attacks during four months in nine attacks and two injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; divided Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been associated and committed by the same murderer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died before the spot .
a witness in the police informed that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which led to an empty pic@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of his retirement , Edmund Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ y , the result of genetic distur@@ b@@ ance , knew the result of his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time I was my first thought , I create that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not true ? of course , one has left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not survive once .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to make him institutional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund could not sit still cra@@ wling until his third year of life , and he still cannot speak .
but it moves slowly .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , that Edmund asked for &quot; Please give me something ahead of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring to him drawing language , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character string -- it says . Edmund invented some characters alone .
Micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a multitude of causes : genetic like in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life of the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus content .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an un@@ aware future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have been asked for long time since long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eless advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the c@@ ic@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

it re@@ covers and the police still looks for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I am taking place under the Olympic Games in the Tur@@ ns and that consists of more than one reason .
first I have been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secon@@ dly : this team has three tur@@ ret , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired to inspir@@ ing many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport type .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gym@@ n@@ ists .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
with the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in America .
now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as they were unexpected , yet master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ class event for women .
Mann@@ a member of A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see the turn@@ around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison one to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics is only four female teams in the team . Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is so that Tur@@ ning is a more expensive sport , and Turner will unite in the first line in private turn@@ around , which are open for training , building clothing , travel and hotel costs ( for the co@@ aches and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in weal@@ thy suburbs that can help the business .
in these verses the Turner will receive their entire training and that is for families a dev@@ res and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes since then they started with the Tur@@ ning .
we have to be inspired by the congregations Au@@ n in@@ numer@@ able , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an effective and light accessible turn@@ around .
I founded my gym of 20 years .
during my events , we have offered a free and affordable tower in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide high quality turbo@@ char@@ gers that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits to health and education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , the thousands of young girls who are interested in love and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thank you , so many young girls can be motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ting proposal
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the modifications by accept@@ ing a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who voted to vote at a vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hunt plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS were in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be harmful to each other delay for people and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains modifications to night and weekend work to improve the care of un@@ favourable times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ person of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance , announced the proposed night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ent doctors have agreed to the proposed contract , in particular that it can heat up the current occupation crisis and it is able to handle all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining , which still remains , until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the BM@@ A solution to the solution of disputes within the government to participate in the government &apos;s presence and sometimes on o@@ es@@ thetic silence .
this was done by a promise , the Jeremy Hunt for the last month , that his door would always stand again .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift up the forces and pron@@ ounce the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , we have made the assistance of assistance provided that they are ready to implement further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw an boost of nearly 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , because nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to grant physicians on the stri@@ kers chain .
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over the modifications by a assumption of the re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to be a better week@@ day for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants who will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS , requested the assist@@ ants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor measures do not reach a little bit , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nursing and their families are not wor@@ ried , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months , we talked to the department of assist@@ ants and related to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to the concerns relating to the pre@@ m@@ ity and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training courses , training courses and gender equality in medicine - a sign for this , how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A meeting in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day - medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after the authorities have been recommended to submit more people for a longer period .
the t@@ inn@@ y medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority is recommended for a four years of taking to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority is recommended for a four years of taking to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fet@@ ch material in the arter@@ ial walls , the pads are formed .
when the day breaks out , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that causes blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood flow and the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack will be subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is driven under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the line design of N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Auth@@ orities Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack suffered a further heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ a@@ str@@ ingent consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the life of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend possible treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the guide design recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves election in Muslim places
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a governmental report due to corruption from the office .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led that far more widespread election was kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored in Muslim municipalities like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es has served the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber , evidence of electoral mis@@ use because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convic@@ tions regarding Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , which is now an anti @-@ corrupt voters , said that the police force should be allowed out of religious mot@@ i@@ fs so bad that it should be allowed to protect the police outside of voting cabins , to protect voters .
he recommends that voters should carry out a reference to themselves in order to prove their identity .
currently , a voters must call only his name and address .
the report suggests , non @-@ remove ink on the fingers of a person if they release their election , to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he requires that the press would have more access to community documents and decisions made by not official controls or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election , but also the municipal government is to protect themselves in front of the wider corruption and financial markets that goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the am@@ atic Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was transferred to a lit@@ an@@ ship to corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes .
the Tribunal found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he would have put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia school@@ ing .
Rah@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the most cor@@ di@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation which cho@@ oses one person as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
he expressed particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ election - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the fo@@ als of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on protecting members of some ethnic min@@ orities was exercised , especially women and young people to choose in accordance with the will of the elders , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ ker background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was concerns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; governmental institutions have such a behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convic@@ tions concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion were ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists process are working to stop &quot; campaign . &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , demands even harder registration checks to prevent the election directory for immigration and social media purposes is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; options consider , voters want to ask for your choice after selecting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not remove ink on the finger of a person as soon as they have delivered their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation of mot@@ ions on a automatic mail selection .
ban , process political activists process full brief@@ ing and env@@ elop@@ es of mail .
the police enter the power to set up di@@ stra@@ ctions for election stations .
a decision to simpli@@ fy an indictment by the People Act 1983 ( the Act of the People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Law in 1983 ) .
photographer banned in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in elec@@ trol@@ ls ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters are alone in the voting cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no complaint was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Appeals Court has proclaimed Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy head on the corrupt and illegal practices due to a lit@@ urg@@ y and illegal practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Town Council &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the courts in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country is wearing a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered spread of electoral fraud and leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic Games in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are this week of the French cycling athl@@ ete Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except Rand and band , which has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ performance of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only to have gold fighter athl@@ ete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you may give the social media belief .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which at present on our normal fi@@ sts , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympic statistics that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ holder .
the h@@ unter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gang@@ er on the bicycle race , many people on the Internet looked like a certain ar@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star in secret .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave that he had already heard his childhood since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I even see no great simil@@ arity , except the fac@@ ial hair@@ y , &quot; divided Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good looking guy , so do I feel it as compli@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur more into the focus : the growing simil@@ arity between the British far@@ er Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to be able to go through the Cuban American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the in@@ c@@ eption acting
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ kind , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alli@@ on Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ roasted skin and bl@@ ond hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the Americans was a Adrian of fans , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong Women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that other simil@@ arities have also fallen .
theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbelie@@ v@@ ably similar visual form and eyes .
another popular compar@@ isons of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , resem@@ bles her own beautiful , wide smile , resem@@ bles by &quot; It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to put him many of his speech .
Twitter User stopped not back when they heard how in@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you first look around the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # .

it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ow@@ es over 90 times at the end of the people who have answered on the Not@@ ice on Twitter

C@@ BC cop@@ ed and expressed his exc@@ use for more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast and released a message .
we regret that these statements have been made and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we spent yesterday night fast with our audience at the broadcast and our fol@@ ks in the social media .
in order to set up one , B@@ yr@@ ons &apos; comments on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation . Byron &apos;s what he said he was very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to just@@ ify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment at the time to ap@@ ologi@@ ze me for the comment that I made after the s@@ war@@ s@@ war@@ time in the C@@ BC Olympic crisis , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t , and I &apos;m sorry for me . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark emp@@ t about woman who tried am@@ us@@ eless in the middle of business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved out her clothing in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try mo@@ ors .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered her , as she looked in it , and put them back into the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of tro@@ users in a shop at the Bou@@ l@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ p@@ ants before she laid it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she revi@@ ved himself and the business , without buying them . &quot;
she said , &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of tro@@ users from the out@@ lay , moved their own shr@@ ubs and tro@@ users from and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wasn &apos;t trying to find a somewhat discre@@ et@@ ly place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ skar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when they returned the under@@ p@@ ants who did not like it , since they put it again into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t liked nothing , r@@ ushed and r@@ ushed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seemed not to inter@@ fere with anyone watching one thing - or about the person who would buy the tro@@ users under circumstances which she tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would take man@@ tro@@ users with the home that had a different person and not washed . &quot;
incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees trying to draw the garments from the sale when it went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of tro@@ users , and to find out that another woman had taken her and had not washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that occurred on Tuesday , 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , deliber@@ ately . &quot;
all products coming from the sale were drawn from the sale .
how to protect himself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Sk@@ y@@ imana could make it a little safer place for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a &apos;s Association in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how you turn the s@@ ke@@ over for your rob@@ bers .
if you &apos;re looking forward to you from behind , then you should see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go out of the line @-@ line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee into the l@@ ath and turn it , while the att@@ ack@@ ers come together in front of pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run and move on back@@ wards , while they set the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line @-@ line , take the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
stop the weight at the same time and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before moving backward and set the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
check out the video to see what Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi fore@@ sees .
but remember that there is a prey on the saf@@ est , your money to surprise - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
Reis@@ er Ian Wright for a guide to guide his tongue to the most dirty locations in Europe
a British travelling time under@@ gone his immune system and dig@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - taking some of the dirty and ec@@ ar@@ est places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k spar@@ ked his course on a Euro Sch@@ ein , a ban@@ ker at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dish@@ wah@@ er of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system .
prior to the le@@ ver of any object , it used a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is turning .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to remove the dish@@ wah@@ er button of a train toilet which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually , in a kitchen , there are more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , nothing left what he ab@@ out@@ stretched , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by entering the world , and did eat great things as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a kid , I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about my health and I have put all kinds of things into my mouth , Earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the movie he was justified to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its prolifer@@ ation showed a lumin@@ ous count of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the l@@ umin@@ ometric hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to finish after their l@@ umin@@ omet@@ res was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60 .
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel movie &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He comes to the worst , what I am in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m sorry here , because it is inside the inside .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products .
the company pays Mr. Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ os@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings that ended with us that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talk about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumers more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the movie film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tried some of the things I have instructed to le@@ ct , as the ec@@ tory Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things , with which it was easier to bring it to Ian , and others , where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty le@@ ak@@ ries on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of those surveyed from lac@@ tic acid bacteria were associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , that they may use at least occasionally products used to contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ging social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ ozi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a Del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they were terrorist attacks .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their property , the property of housing corporation found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were ens@@ la@@ ved holes , wooden di@@ ets were fired , rub@@ b@@ ish was lubri@@ cated on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family moved and it is thought that she lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that it fears that the apartment is no longer to repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I &apos;m the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is probably considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it .
the couple had three sons , who had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which had joined the family , in@@ timi@@ zation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffic@@ king , and excessive cry , mar@@ es and flu@@ kes .
sk@@ el@@ eton , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , there was an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ isolation behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which will be demolished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
it were tra@@ ded in the property where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past , the wood ri@@ bs were excited
neighbours said that she had to fight them on the street and called on the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing del@@ og@@ ated them and their partners this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary surrender .
the Del@@ og@@ ging were che@@ ered by the neigh@@ bors who told her life to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed !
now , where they &apos;re finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing , said that it would not miss the family to co@@ operate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years .
on the enclosed side of the municipal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ants was able to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ im@@ ation is always the last step is to consider Corn@@ wall Hou@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their works for their neighbours have had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful .
I guess all the work which my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church , which were bra@@ ced to us and have received us the information they have done .
I hope that these developments will be consol@@ ation to some neigh@@ bors and the message is con@@ veyed that ant@@ iso@@ ara behavi@@ ors will not be toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck told that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all have more than 20 .
a dirty mattress that are left in one of the bedroom of the house after the Del@@ og@@ ation on the ground
workers of the house management now have to destroy waste mountains , which en@@ cir@@ cled the house
in 2014 the police carried a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
sk@@ el@@ eton was given a fine of fine , after it was found guilty by the owner of a drug class B in commercial view .
it claimed that the money for a gra@@ vest@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was born in 2013 at a car accident .
after having been homeless , it is assumed that Tan@@ ya and their partners live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will del@@ ay@@ ing ten@@ ants who do not keep the house rules
Angela C@@ row was distributed by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that the Del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not hold on the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who think they can be@@ have themselves without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been ashamed of such behavi@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ isolation behaviour that continue to continue with partners to protect our churches .

the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion flying on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so it had to fly as deep that this is the only way to realise it .
the speaker said that the jet made a little deeper than usual in the vicinity of the poor visible conditions , however , the air forces insi@@ sted that the safety was at risk of any time .
area fires destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira .

Donald Tr@@ ump dream &quot; massive problems &quot; in the campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weakness of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ proof m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire could write something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the Republi@@ can camp &apos;s Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ icals Christians , which he asked for assistance in key states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ ilt are wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ ature , he took up his famous media .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen W@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a secure bank for Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ors in the US from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival in the Democr@@ at , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes look at the front , but not by the distance , which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
than endangered also Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump said to the question , as he did stop the march of Clinton , &quot; as I did so far . &quot;
and whether behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he do not make anything else to tell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not rich in order for the reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is said to under@@ take funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better change values .
instead , instead of rep@@ ublic@@ ans the candidates of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans meet more strongly among the arms .
Olympia : three sc@@ am sc@@ am with D@@ oping test
the IOC wants to agree to a discipl@@ in@@ gement committee .
Ken@@ ias athletes are threatened after the second D@@ oping affair with the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
after a beta testing at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village Kenya sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee ruled that , in order to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ous commission , in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function@@ ary told that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , a Ur@@ ine @-@ probe , under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this is the team leader Ken@@ ias has been reported by D@@ oping controls .
the IA@@ AF world association has the IOC to identify information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations into a IA@@ AF present@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called the IA@@ AF statement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and has been issued as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed , &quot; the Ken@@ yan chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i declared .
it was owned by the ac@@ creditation of the athletes who stood on the list for the training control of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has become more than 800 metres in the Beijing World Cup in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Championships Michael Rot@@ ich has been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is alleged to have informed about money payments from his country on the upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been working for numerous d@@ oping tra@@ ps since a longer period of time .
in the announcement of the IOC to the Rio Olympics , more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls previously pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into vis@@ or .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had been able to play a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia start .
as a result , W@@ A@@ DA Kenya took the W@@ A@@ DA Kenya from the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight with the rules of the W@@ A@@ DA are .
Kenya is considered as a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of TV reports on ARD , ARD have always been raised , that in Kenya D@@ oping means they are easily accessible and there will be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ wi@@ gs .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had put them in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this field , it could be demonstrated that in this sport type area and systematically hired systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lov@@ em@@ aking , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a surprising C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
one musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Meister@@ werk .
the artistic director C@@ eci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli is playing a older Maria .
she re@@ members her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
first because it is exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of lob@@ ster for the Opera House : &quot; C@@ eci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so a honor for us to work with her .
she is an innocent man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather sou@@ ther@@ ly temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheer@@ ful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about over@@ parts and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we spent the refugees at that time , the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want to do it .
these are the same topics , and they are as much as it was in the same way .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School of London , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za sult@@ ana , one of three British deb@@ tors who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after their family shortly after she had previously had to leave the country , and had to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only thing is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that are associated with the risks involved in a war zone - people will ever stop this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school trips from the East London rose in a plane toward Turkey , and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
the sult@@ anas family has been informed that she married a IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and has become a widow within a few months .

the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere together to bring a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous nude people would like to calendar for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 the next generation of top@@ models .

I do this for women .
apparently , he is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to depic@@ tions of loose and classical ne@@ ff@@ ness , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish municipality expects mass protest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who pra@@ ises himself and Erdo@@ gan is engaged for packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of people who escape from Turkey to Germany in short term .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands &quot; believes the president of the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass cur@@ cur@@ sion to Germany in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands of thousands of volunteers from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had crossed over the months of Kurdish tre@@ bur@@ gen with Stra@@ its , 500,000 Kurds could flee from Turkey on the run .
after the failed p@@ utsch , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal Turks were added .
many will be re@@ leg@@ ged in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that takes refugees in his own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accused appe@@ als to the settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ an cities .
thus , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the advance of Kurds on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ minated in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who also joined the CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government asked that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is taking place .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
fire mark@@ er as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics of professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who pra@@ ises himself and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , by the way , also the Kem@@ alist and sa@@ as@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already reported the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all have been justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , not the war , poverty or oc@@ tiv@@ less@@ ness will be pla@@ ited .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , thus by a state @-@ of @-@ nation , individually pursued .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als do not get anything from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the estate .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
in 2021 the District elections will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it is not until now it is not : summer holidays , heat and land battles - that bit@@ es itself .
the loc@@ als , who are convinced by the electoral fighting , are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are on the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so may not choose the estate .
to do this , practical problems come : in the holidays are hel@@ pers to spread the posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and start out at the end of the vote , only effort@@ lessly .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to come close to the people around the people .
the hot phase when you can tell at all , has just begun .
and it is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D is cut off and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 , government of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , can be seen from his major posters .

the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if one makes for the wrong time at the right place campaign .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major exploration , Angela Merkel in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Sax@@ onia as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad also to listen to other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North East CD@@ U ren@@ ounces largely on the usual vot@@ er conditions on market places and shopping m@@ alls with sun shiel@@ ds and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means Kok@@ ert , play only one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

B@@ 27 Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is gentle , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for the persons responsible for the construction work that start at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is sole praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ gas station &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the south on week@@ day after the end of October , to be completed by the end of October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also praised to the construction of the construction responsible for the construction work for the construction work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the locking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abolished and so the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed .
the citizens can now return from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was partially significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says responsible for the traffic @-@ related management of the rehabilitation department Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ ams searched and rather to their Nav@@ i confi@@ ded as the signs .
what led to that man@@ cher trucks in residential zones .
since the speed limit has not been observed , the municipality strengthened the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable trans@@ missions , &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the location itself .
there have been two to three times a minute .
the fastest @-@ speed was at 77 hours kilometers per hour in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
in the maps , business people do not want to look .
but that the B 27 has led to them for net sales in them , everyone who asks you to look through .
however , some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end client &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier speaks Thomas Sul@@ z from a &quot; most light drop , &quot; but also a fact that of course , &quot; the mileage is missing . &quot;
the streets along the strongest are the streets along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly known crown , finds significant words .
that is already exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all the hosts have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
customers are made from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about each euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales growth rate he rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street en@@ forcement have thrown his operations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to put away half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics would have been re@@ acted differently .
instead , the government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the note that the restaurant can be prof@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they must also have the dis@@ advantages that caused by the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts , where it has been more generous .
at all Kl@@ agen , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass on .
finally , the family enterprise has been set up since 17@@ 15 , and has been on the long history of history .
it is now possible to understand that the other regular guests can now understand less frequently due to the complicated traffic control .
if you don &apos;t go down , it &apos;s too nice too .
after the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts towards the end of the refurb@@ ishment .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work is already brutal .
it is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the terrorist control of laws .
after the latest announ@@ cements , the Minister of Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a shift status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the con@@ cave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically un@@ ut@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not require anyone .
other , more points would be discussed at first within the parties .
I feel that too .
but as the Minister of Interior , he was lying on results and to a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the coalition .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has given a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already familiar , announced that a new safety authority order to take care of the neck @-@ encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU requirements for passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second race for proposals that have not been doing with the SPD so far : he wants to kno@@ ck the sympath@@ ies for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s difficult to be difficult for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ Mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he still keep it for ever and challenge nothing at the co@@ al@@ ition@@ ist anyway .
a few new ideas presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
they are partly in himself : it is planning fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for the detention of deportation .
refugees , which are specifically brought into the country , should make their smartphones check and make social media accounts for a security check in before .
at Dul@@ ations for the last asylum seek@@ ers , he will present some worse than so far - about such , the pen@@ dic@@ ates , or dis@@ agree their papers to s@@ lei@@ gh their identity .
a lot of these is politically and legal .
some also un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - with the im@@ bal@@ ances of thought , for example - is the question : what does it actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to speak that the terror attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were .
in addition , many people were wor@@ ried about safety in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that under@@ tak@@ eth human beings , let not let them rise in electoral times too .
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the contamination is great .
and yes , there are voting rights .
the Union and the SPD focus on the subject of internal security so increasingly in position .
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ dening dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some global Unions interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ orts ur@@ ges also a bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is too ti@@ dy here for a great sound here .
he has nothing of a return from double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
they re@@ proof , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he was constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ fixed on all corners of the corners and whether it actually is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist , it must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of stuff , which could cause war .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ filing itself in the topic of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ fl@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only a carefully talk to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen gli@@ mp@@ ing goes through .
despite diesel companies the delivery figures are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
on the return call , there is vort@@ ex about a term .
Volkswagen launches deliveries of deliveries into the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can still present an increase in the previous year despite its many brands and many well @-@ run markets .
but in July weak@@ ened the core brand VW especially in Western Europe and loaded back to the overall sales as announced in the Da@@ x record company .
the brand sold the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost a sixth of sixth .
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann launched the weaker figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote forced the exit from the EU , explained a speech .
in the USA , where the exhaust emissions first created , there is also a Min@@ us too be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony continued to be gli@@ mp@@ ed by the Diesel@@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only one supplier of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles were be@@ ech .
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to set up a sales plan from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , with 5.@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls about 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament in the workshops .
in the wake of re@@ armament , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles give it a fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance no deteri@@ oration .
the bus station to the customer according to conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; is not talking about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
the reason for legal host@@ ility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee of all diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that this meeting was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to meet the requirements of my research commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity , after conversion , no wor@@ sen@@ ing will remain unchanged and all typical relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
with the long term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen looks the possibility that customers will come to a workshop after the conversion about a workshop in a workshop - and this could return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that there is no damage to any other damage , which is nothing to do with Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal , in relation to possible warranty conditions as it was called .
therefore , the term &quot; guarantee &quot; does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Ra@@ iff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich savings in the future - the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers to park the 40 million euro on g@@ ro@@ - or daily money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single incident and sees no signal : normal au@@ sterity would not be afraid to pay for their au@@ sterity criminal punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 per cent pen@@ alties .
this fee requires the Ra@@ iff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund starting from September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on g@@ ro@@ - or daily balance .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been looking for 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and that he could not understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now give the cost to the caus@@ ality principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is just too dangerous in the christ@@ ening of the Ra@@ iff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had already experienced four accidents , I do not want to get the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ quet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers have their understanding and changes in other reference forms .
only few emigrated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they alone bear alone , be &quot; business cycle permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers .
with criminal off@@ enses for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Ra@@ iff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg land made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect private consumers to pay for deposits to pay for deposits , in addition to the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see it &quot; is a client@@ ele that is out@@ ten@@ ant by the property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has formed two locations in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ae @-@ E@@ likes , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , actors , sport@@ s@@ men and entrepreneurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the cooperative association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the German Popular Ban@@ ks and Ra@@ iff@@ eis@@ en@@ Ban@@ ks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to the negatives , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threatened the Immig@@ ration of An@@ leg@@ ers to the competition .
customers in Germany will not be dropped in width .
destination boards : who are buying records ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before you get to the comment part in order to over@@ look him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ sensitive co@@ war@@ es , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ organisation of sound plates will not be seen on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which would like to welcome the physical objects of physical objects but due to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a plate recently , according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the un@@ likely buyer group .
it is not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ing - it has an emotional significance : older record players keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , I would follow myself during a busy street in S@@ oho Tour , a modest grey suit and wild , before I stand , my hands hold and something bur@@ ial thing such as : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look at that . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look on it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly sitting on his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now completing the buildings where an independent seller is located - there is still a hand@@ ful fantastic record company .
I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I by S@@ ister Ray ( data count : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I have not followed him home ) , dressing the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy panels , which he could not afford to buy and again items that he sold , when he sold young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , who was released when I was 11 or 12 . things , with whom I was probably something young to buy them , &quot; he says .
it &apos;s true that those who buy panels , rather , and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
this is my aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets with the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have caused to buy their old records again .
of the conversations I have led , people usually have been un@@ le@@ ashed in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their panels , &quot; says he .
this would explain the boom to the App@@ endi@@ ces of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica , to realize that record transactions offers a soo@@ thing community of equal inn@@ ings .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to return to the stability of trusted sound insulation , retri@@ eve objects , happy youth unemployment .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as a collector so and I think it is so many people so much .
it is a simple way to employ spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of one board stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this point of the news Report , I would probably look very wor@@ ried , while I p@@ lowed through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova compilation .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( numbers : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently joined here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radio record record , so I can put it into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive @-@ la@@ sty , less music la@@ sty .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who are only slow to clean .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an underground audience , when I clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthesis and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ens from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity to the customer .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but n@@ ag@@ ious psych@@ mat@@ a are difficult to conc@@ eive if you &apos;re standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for some minutes in business and consider the variety of panels for sale .
it is more than a man@@ ne@@ quin with a large purchase .
it doesn &apos;t des@@ erve much , therefore the collection of plates , no real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ ar@@ est epidemic .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders : urban Out@@ cher .
while I &apos;m sure to bra@@ ve the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I think a group of young te@@ ens who group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter is thinking about to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to deal them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for these items would mean more money for the sector , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v did agree , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors and record players who exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ps through record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they do not spur about the shoulders of an uns@@ af@@ e , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders of nothing in middle ages .

French Court ref@@ uses quot@@ ation about demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live , settled down .
in case of a trial hearing this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should carry down 72 temporary stores , selling , hair@@ dres@@ ser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would like to represent a parallel business that would not be paid by taxes and fire risk .
humanitarian groups par@@ ted the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals that are offered by the nation@@ ally supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .

a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary stores , but spati@@ ally considered that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are completely re@@ perc@@ ei@@ vable . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must set itself to the next generation speed measurement : in different Länder , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the speed is particularly effective to over@@ flow .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic Company from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or for gentle bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide you with a stationary bl@@ ot@@ ers to comply with the speed limit .
a durable mobile setup can be too dangerous or agile .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days and the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be found over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit , as well as delivery verb@@ ote to time , timet@@ res and vehicle class can also be super@@ v@@ ated .
in the high @-@ driven state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer hook .
if it is not easy to see it , it is lowered in the knife , so that the wheels in the pan@@ zer@@ ed and also van@@ ish outside the outer skin .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the gl@@ itter before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also flo@@ ats with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain picked up silver in the 7 series ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came down on Thursday night at a ab@@ rupt stop during the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji told a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back of the line and ro@@ ared strength to win gold - their first Olympics of your color .
the defeat was failed by the silver medal for the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final .
but ir@@ respective of these , Fi@@ ji had beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it is likely that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chef trainer Ben Ryan , former head of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind .
eight years ago , they lost their game by Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap is hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and made the GB@@ S attacks .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , than O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes of play Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , added another attack from the right corner that he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a h@@ ensive point of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal to achieve , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ start and there was still over a minute play@@ time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ f@@ ake through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji had been born to play the 7 , while the GB had still more .
it is that way .
GB resulted in fundamental changes to half @-@ time and completed the fi@@ ji@@ ous gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a Br@@ illi@@ ant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton started a trial for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went back to the southern se@@ per@@ ate whose fans sang , tra@@ ps and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bu@@ ne .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ff set the i @-@ bag with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ st@@ le , the Fi@@ j@@ is surrounded and exter@@ minated in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Britain hit South Africa in a kne@@ eling match from the race - UK transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive foot work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant novel Tac@@ kling von Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the train@@ ee to the rowing victory
there will be no engine in gold than those who want to give and what will be called .
from the first rowing set@@ back to the last , 220 rock H@@ ie@@ ve , who came into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their gol@@ den@@ em moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting on the herd , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympics in the two @-@ person without tax , the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid out on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ occupied action , which is also exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es that reflect on the surface with the elegance of vibrations , which does not reflect the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind each gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to don@@ ate hel@@ pers , which make the difference , and there was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did it .
if you do not do that , he spreads himself everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had happiness that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , taking what the inter@@ ruption was to be a minimum , if that , under such circumstances , is the correct phr@@ ase .
I needed money , so it had to go back soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was at the hospital and ran along the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that is how it begins .
rowing on itself is already a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ fertility of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who had a ner@@ getic morning to talk a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal artil@@ lery regim@@ ent in one use in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I worked , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin if we are nobody , therefore a massive thank you for him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for training or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not be mi@@ th@@ aged .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were really caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in process . &quot;
it is really important to be able to ri@@ p .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something of rab@@ ies .
we wanted to have no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a time for one year before it will meet decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV Adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years very exempl@@ ary for clarity :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , retired in retirement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association is considered as &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fresh water @-@ pot@@ ent water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so there was a period of some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water @-@ forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one sailed with &quot; Bavarian State as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old colleague , which was 28 years as Managing Director .
at the age of 65 , he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Community Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with around 5500 inhabitants .
member communities are the congregations of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities there are water supply agreements .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns , in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set as a water keeper and was appointed as managing director of the association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very varied and they extend from water management systems , maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the household waste plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emer@@ gen@@ cies at weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ person .
as an outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation to farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the rest@@ art@@ ing of water pipes .
I have not given no stand@@ still , and always recorded new innovations because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ atio , she praised G@@ öl@@ lers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with much heart rate for his water @-@ purpose and has been living with the water @-@ purpose federation , as it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success of the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group at the Lower Fran@@ ks District Court .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s hand praised Aqu@@ arian Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from its view@@ point , he described the fountain and re@@ structure of the public association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the tu@@ b@@ ital at the cr@@ ush under Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
here , at minus 17 degrees , the whole night had to work through , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because one filled the can@@ ister of p@@ ett@@ stadt with sna@@ kes .
the management of the drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who became the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago - and addressed to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;

steel - light view for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions height .
financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the Green electricity promotion , are from the table .
it will remain in the liberation of renewable energies of renewable energies in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really pleased that we finally could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission had originally planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases from the high furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission on talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators will be replaced in steel plants , an EEG change@@ over will be 20 percent .
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission on its own production .
this means that the status qu@@ o of the previous regulation will be re@@ written .
the successful attempt by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more needs to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the reform of the emission standards are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and substantial pricing since the financial crisis of 2008 .
last year , the situation further strengthened , when the world &apos;s largest producer in China , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand , threw a massive steel on the global market .
European manufacturers cast Chinese steel c@@ aul@@ ts to the Chinese company d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has something relaxed .
for one show , import duties on import @-@ steel effect , compared to others , the economic prospects in China have hung up .
un@@ clear how sustainable the price is re@@ covering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
finally the prices were stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de the closure of individual works .
at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel producers remain in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tonnes well as well as six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Community was ha@@ sted on Friday .
after a short increase in May the quantity completed the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been reduced by two percent below the previous year .
the association expects an improved job situation in the coming months thanks to improved job situation .
community , mind , health : singing the Seni@@ ors
she accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school teacher , in the teacher &apos;s teacher , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior chor@@ us .
&quot; sing pra@@ ises me - emot@@ ionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful and more lively , she says .
in the next door , they do something good with their health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most of the Seni@@ ors sing in chor@@ us and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular cl@@ ones you can connect the social contacts and maintain .
because often social and family structures are often in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to arrange and organise themselves to the others , and to learn one another - a choir is a very special form of understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler means .
the elderly and controlled breathing has a depth and controlled breathing .
those who calls his lung regularly , is not so quick from the pu@@ rest in everyday life .
even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says from the German labor association of the Seni@@ ors organizations .
in the older generations the common S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing from songs in elderly people are w@@ ret@@ ched , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Lie@@ d@@ lyrics and particularly melo@@ dies , people suffer for long @-@ lying events themselves .
when singing , the head is required for special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , focus on their own voice and to focus on a pre@@ defined rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , do not only be concentr@@ ating on itself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in choir , H@@ ac@@ kler means .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is also growing by singing in chor@@ us .
even to show yourself : if I do anything for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people who hears it , when a tone is doing beside it ?
in search of the appropriate offer you have several ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if anyone sings from the known circle in an old ench@@ y@@ man , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
he who wants to sing in a church choir can apply directly to the church or church stand .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
who does not have access to the Internet , can ask family , friends or neigh@@ bors around the Internet .
who would like to sing , should necessarily join a choir , en@@ ig@@ t H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing good and has something to sing - this applies to any age .
cats respond sensitive to cr@@ aters as a cr@@ ater of the young
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect the rowing from Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
for her surprise the male didn &apos;t let the male too cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always .
female cats may recognize the reg@@ ression of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the che@@ wing of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster than bi@@ b of k@@ itt@@ ens who think in great distress , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cr@@ ater also react to the o@@ aks of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the che@@ wing of less and heavily worn young are either perc@@ ei@@ vable for the male either not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ itarian study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ie differs from its help of their help .
a total of nine adult cr@@ aters and eight female subjects were observed in the MH@@ H .
they were played by little ones for three minutes , taken out of the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with write messages of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens which were lifted up in addition .
the researchers hold their findings in spite of the low sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even those who had no their own offspring were re@@ acted to the cry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned swi@@ fter up to the loud@@ speakers when they played a very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be @-@ born or developer with sexual mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a surprise that the male re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women react sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .

before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in July , during the cancellation of the acceptance test after the overthrow in July , the government , the daily life of regular vou@@ chers should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected to join the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
the football is not done before the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r , the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant .
consequently , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America in the United States .
he shall be the followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
although it is valid for 90 days , the emergency status still applies until October , in fact , that on the life of most Turks , however , did not affect the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public squares in the whole country has declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sports is - like the whole country - split in supporters and ad@@ versaries of earth .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs are not count towards the friends of the President .
but the Turks , but in view of the dramatic experience in history , is the strict re@@ jection of military car@@ riages .
even the fans even agree - no matter if your heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Pok@@ al@@ Winner &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
its sporty value presented the Cologne in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; asked him , &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in excellent way and secured the trop@@ hy of his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion was a p@@ amper@@ ing conclusion .
after the pre @-@ round sound in the Champions League hit the &quot; lion &quot; in the Europe League early .
in the South by Li@@ g there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who will compete with 26 season figures as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ema , the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
taking part in the AC under the contract and in Bes@@ ik@@ tas had announced only the coup attempt to return to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario will come to us , he must only say it , &quot; says the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
in addition , the storms would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce approximately one third of its estimated 7.5 million euros in an estimated annual sal@@ aries : &quot; his salary at Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in Rio Olympics
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa can not start in Rio .
other survived athle@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh at this - they are fighting in Rio for medals .
the topic D@@ oping is determined according to the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics Games .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ f@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained about a d@@ oping cou@@ re shortly before the play , was embar@@ r@@ assed and spread out at its start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scene : with a sto@@ cked smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a J@@ ub@@ el@@ sturm .
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men , who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed two times because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its launch , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered the largest ch@@ allen@@ ger of U@@ sa@@ in Bolt .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two times Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock after having been demonstrated by the pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don .

Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the World Champion of 2012 , World championships in 2013 and European championships were tested positive for the forbidden stim@@ ul@@ ans with meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine in 2010 and 2016 .
Per@@ kovic fought the kno@@ w@@ ingly in@@ gest@@ ation and was imprisoned for six months .
the four most far saus@@ ages in this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ ites in this year .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Games and two times world champion over 400 m , had been positive in 2010 and imprisoned for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement continues to have been credited .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athl@@ ete were detected so many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title , nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone D@@ oping .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 based on a judgment of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the World Ran@@ kings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ it@@ in has only been tested positive in May , but can still be started in Rio .
at the 29 year old world championships , hints on taking a forbidden supplement were found , the sperm of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency W@@ A@@ DA fell mild and ran already on July 13 .
bomb error in Thailand - Austrian &apos;s hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said spokesperson for Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Friday morning .
they suffered cutting breeds and had been treated in hospital , but this could already be left again .
her hom@@ ebo@@ arding was planned for early September .
whether from another explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also an Austrian citizen , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arise in contact with local authorities , so S@@ öl@@ l .
at approximately 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a foo@@ th@@ ed two bombs .
according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ ateral killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three countries and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early , two explo@@ si@@ ves went up , according to the authorities , another man was killed .
also by Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
during the Det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police data .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , the south @-@ east coast of the country explo@@ ded a further bomb that killed an urban workforce .
according to the authorities , the spr@@ inter has gone to the air in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally the determin@@ ations of Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , named it .
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army cor@@ di@@ eral Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself to possible mot@@ i@@ fs - but most likely to do the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern at the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
by contrast , the Thai police stated , the terrorist attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist state movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather , however , that bombs were laid against bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have received confi@@ dential advice on the forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and places were informed .
it is un@@ clear that the group behind the attacks .
the police informed their civil servants around the country , the security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and leisure district .
in Thailand , there are still small bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years from Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason @-@ like bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends a result of the instructions of the Thai Security Auth@@ orities .
high level of safety ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and the surrounding area .
according to conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations , these provinces will not be dis@@ closed in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this is similar to the military as well as in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs have been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta that had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ distur@@ ban@@ ces , the kingdom keeps itself too good to have the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military did not have succeeded in order to get the handle since years in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict , more than 6500 people have been killed .
almost one year ago , Bangkok was also killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ swal@@ low 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody bombing of the country &apos;s younger history .
the rights &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; is in the visa of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several nation@@ alities , the Constitutional Court also asked the Group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the freedom of democratic fundamental rules , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitu@@ ent Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ ated in extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore , we watch the movement as well .
the &quot; ident@@ ities movement &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Multi@@ cult &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the loss of his own identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already .
Ma@@ as said , his authority voted closely with the country &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities movement &apos; try to pick up their target group as she stands , &quot; said the constitutional protection .
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts to talk with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an ad@@ mis@@ erable advertising for your own thing .
propaganda must be emot@@ ionally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently it had given reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D policies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ as said , he didn &apos;t have any insights .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species is only relevant in a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes its objectives and becomes extrem@@ ist .
so what such people have an impact on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a look at the significant increase of tim@@ ed offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee meetings , Ma@@ ill@@ ate said that he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we &apos;ve found it in recent years that it can be tim@@ eless structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite sure that further legitim@@ acy groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee and attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ ages .
but it cannot be recogni@@ zable in a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal consequences .
the present groups were formed on regional levels or in social networks .
concerned , concerned , Ma@@ ate concerned that many over@@ handles went on the account of people who did not occur in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed offen@@ ders previously used with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left hand , which then radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ style , played there no part .
the compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea as he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 @-@ metre @-@ style alone .

two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to turn out their data according to the opposite le@@ aster , who drove partly on the way back .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a microphone of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six rescue cars and an emergency cars came to the accident on the state road 2 .

the fees per cubic meters of water will be available from 1 October 2016 for the area of san@@ itation Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Which pole 3.@@ 44 instead of currently 2,@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the san@@ itation fee will be increased by then , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after all relevant calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the auth@@ orization of the budget was established by the land@@ rat and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ mining the se@@ wage plant .
the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to maintain legal foundations to operate the facilities .
from 1 October 2016 onwards , citizens and industrial enterprises from the World Council , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must grab deeper into the wal@@ let .
the temperature increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the Board of Directors , a new calendar was necessary for the se@@ wage plant in the market town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , excess and sub@@ covers from the previous calendar period are to be compens@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gra@@ zing increases increases Schmidt so that it is suitable for all three se@@ wage plants around relatively small san@@ itation with a very low waste loss , ranging between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year .
due to its low distribution system , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have been gra@@ fted .
moreover , the se@@ wage rise in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the underlying cold treatment period , in all three plants , they were not least fallen due to its age san@@ ction and repair expenses in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for World Council , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt conclu@@ des that in the se@@ wer@@ age Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to any damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk pupp@@ y , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and has had to be installed after almost 20 years of operation , the very small pond can be installed and an additional ventilation system can be installed in order to keep the water legal regulations as well as in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to this extraordinary expenses , the continued assistance and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were clearly under the current level in 2011 / 2012 .
Stein@@ häuser made clear that small san@@ itation included in the three plants for the operation and maintenance of the three plants . &quot;
in this case , Schmidt was added to the market town of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature crit@@ ici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this Filter is inspired by An@@ ime @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that there is infinite opposite races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows for about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities such as a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn to a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are uns@@ hi@@ el@@ ded , autonomous tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ dom per day .
all failure to come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past criticism in which they were accused that the app Black@@ face con@@ vey@@ ors or white skin is prop@@ elled as beauty ideal .
when these week also proposed a filter to some Uzbekistan , who gave them phar@@ yn@@ g@@ gling , false teeth and evap@@ oration che@@ eks , they called some critics a r@@ amp@@ ant car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow vision . &quot;
they asked if they repeated the repeated contro@@ vers@@ y on a bigger problem , that the company with diversity .
the news and the indignation have been widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but the out@@ standing , rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us experienced , rec@@ alled the filter to viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
other loans decided the An@@ ime comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student who have been widespread on the photos far , that the filter &quot; viol@@ end and sum@@ mers said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the yellow stri@@ pe is drawn into the extreme extre@@ m .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ch .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ y and integ@@ rating battle , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in the hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older opponent - could rather go out to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to do the same as a product manager and engineering in medium for medium , their Snap@@ chat account asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that r@@ ass@@ in contro@@ vers@@ y reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leadership and ended with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their staff so that they can meet these decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that are working there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company doesn &apos;t publish figures for the diversity of its workforce , and refers to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , it turned from Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently submitted a personnel responsible which focuses on under@@ graduate population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she was closed to her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership ver@@ more IS@@ IS Intelligence information , provides the Congress of the Congress
military commission of the United States Central Command changed further information to draw an optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the armed forces , intelligence service and the con@@ bud@@ get@@ ary report reported by large dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts , reported how to change their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in combat against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida to control the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news services that were typically embroi@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com was perio@@ dic@@ ated regularly by the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the management error in Cent@@ Com ranges up until the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indications that government tips are given under Obama instructions , it shows how analysts saw under pressure from their pre @-@ laws , an optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command news releases , comments and statements before the Congress was clearly positive as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com ruled publicly known that a military regime could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress held in Kansas , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the tips of the Central Command changed the information service reports to play the threat by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in the life after giving them wor@@ ries about mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway in the Ministry of Defense of the Ministry of Defense .
the Democratic members of the News Conference published on Thursday released their own findings , which agreed with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a excessive process ass@@ ess@@ ments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest Democr@@ at Democrats in the Com@@ missions , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the release of nach@@ richt@@ en@@ sic reports &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the moral under analy@@ st and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was excessive space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. ship and Democrats gave no evidence to an intervention of the White House in Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General Assembly , which was added to complaints according to Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , an Press@@ ure of the Pentagon , was in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation was still underway .
but he also assumed that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ us@@ sions over the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year did the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ our@@ able in@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of obe@@ dience about the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , such as the then government under George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many analysts only saw a small Occup@@ ation of Occup@@ ation in Iraq and compl@@ aining about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after speci@@ fying government officials , that contrary to the statements of the government &apos;s attacks against the Islamic State , there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ nation @-@ commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its superior positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four @-@ fourth match in the field of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people that keep their gates in memory .
however , they know , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic Competition and are also in their group with the British in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first @-@ place step is going to move a little bit longer out of the way that lead the other group .
like always the game on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising f@@ uss through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London Games at the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel university ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to apply things to better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the job of work in London that we now have .
we have to ri@@ p the rowing completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the se@@ am area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and maintained the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until they put the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she completed a spr@@ int with a flat ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the middle and drew the ball into the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the por@@ ters of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , it &apos;s too late , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel ste@@ ad@@ fast and un@@ stable , a r@@ ender run between competition and stre@@ ak .
it is , as it would be the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself a burning staff , protecting from the bracel@@ ets to the ban@@ ker for tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch the TV , reading a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the waiting time in the coffee shop , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ an@@ age of dimples , could definitely be sent to Prime Time , based through sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even a real @-@ man .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fought in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further away from the center , some in the shade are sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swim and may rule it long .
but if I should definitely make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tr@@ ol@@ ins .
although the Tramp@@ oline jump already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many of whom I asked , didn &apos;t know that there is an Olympic @-@ port@@ art at all .
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ anz .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athl@@ ete until 2012 , who made it until the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese , and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year .
the tr@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has some outside lateral eyes , partly because it sounds for the un@@ checked ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as it sounds for the Olympic Games .
in this place I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end up - but also the gra@@ z@@ ie of the gym and diving , the two sports , which are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanently jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ genuine and Sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
they are assessed according to the official Olympic program , after execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flying time . &quot;
two @-@ eight athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue to go on gold , faster , upwards and above , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground .
they don &apos;t just hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further cav@@ ity target : the World or Olympic Guard .
the targeted stri@@ ve is no@@ bel , ad@@ mir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I yourself when looking at this games as a bit ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers an respir@@ ation .
the v@@ ector of the bo@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly severe as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upward , then forward again , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a contest too , of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant lift of time and gravity .
it &apos;s so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon in the streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the end @-@ hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably is probably over@@ seen in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness is only achie@@ vable through the Ang@@ us and the object of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to wait for the air .
&quot; a generation of protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is one of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers demand political changes in Ethiopia urged to violent Resistance in the government .
witnesses say that some protest@@ ers have been killed during cl@@ ashes with the police force .
is Ethiopia straight to break together ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ban on the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government had the country and far more territories .
last week thousands of people fell on roads and requested political changes .
the response of the government was in@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were un@@ armed and killed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country and even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , said the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians in order to combat terror in the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , are so much Western aid .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has been dra@@ stically improved - there is a new embar@@ r@@ assing in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even when Ethiopia was other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to strike the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , although dis@@ sidents were committed to silence .
many were sent into exile or prison , put to death or put into the desert in the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press people and don &apos;t have any other options but it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth were protest@@ ing .
a generation Protestant .
there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from soil use to wor@@ ms to power of the ruling coalition .
after a widespread vot@@ al election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , st@@ resses along the border to Erit@@ rea , a fight for this pe@@ eled and controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were over the last years more or less constra@@ ined , which could support the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of the de@@ bit@@ ing after years of H@@ ink@@ u@@ ck@@ el@@ ns are now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate using the social media , since cheaper smartphones were increasingly more common and improved to internet services .
even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially with protests , many people still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide , where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they were assembled as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ cos@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from ae@@ th@@ op@@ oly , predominantly Christian high@@ lands come , in politics and economy while they are exploited O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat areas .
but this too changes .
&quot; we &apos;re talking to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u said a leader of the O@@ ro@@ cos@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trading and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in an un@@ sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was considered to be tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think of the corners .
analysts say that he was particularly striking in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special commission to edit opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ insured reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analy@@ st say that he enjoys not the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 after thousands of elections were protest@@ ant by the government , according to data analy@@ tics that were stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ ors , many protest@@ ers were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and these days of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ anger , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ n@@ ical form .
the last month of the Protestant g@@ ond@@ ary , an am@@ har@@ ic city , run by Tig@@ ray , and the hat@@ red against the Tig@@ ray is always common in the social media .
analy@@ st say that protests against the USA and other Western allies are bringing in an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ings across the neighboring Somalia , even if it had recently over@@ hur@@ ried that they had closed this base .
while the West will definitely wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to break his ally in an already more volat@@ ile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin grave hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y which surro@@ unds his campaign by taking his campaign that his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State , not seriously .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions on the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to be clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings its Mit@@ stre@@ l , which ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain in the actual position of which he could not have meant .
after having made the suggest@@ ion at a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to signi@@ fying what President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS .
but in a morning feeling on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is just sar@@ cast@@ ically .
contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews that Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought that it was totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to destroy the statement of anything that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t know anything of it .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump down , while he tries to guide the focus of his campaign to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on economic situation in Michigan , this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et tried again to return this topic again .
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m into his defense .
at the end of July he moved to himself , when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s E@@ mails , but he said later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ ist . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then may be &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who watched the language of both candidates .
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements about enough , so that it can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of shar@@ pen@@ ing the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a number of their sound , since its re@@ fraction went down further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with big lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for its pro@@ voc@@ ative appearance , he is accused of understanding his critics , his declar@@ ations , or his hum@@ our .
but while it is further strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps j@@ okes have brought his loyal Mit@@ stre@@ l into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant will be his testimony .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , prominent advoc@@ ators , gave great effort to defend the candidates in an CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense , that in front of Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ packs , completely false and therefore it happened , because he withdrew troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ instream Republi@@ can try to argue that the government used under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor minister , it allowed IS@@ IS permitted to spread the situation in the Middle East to control .
in front of the voting events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and rejected them on any of his words , and to be pre@@ heated against him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , j@@ u@@ chs &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked to Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ame@@ ful café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where one could pay only cash that had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years there was good coffee serving .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ der front was pushed .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie store , which was set up in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native mar@@ gin@@ alised as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist wh@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and ver@@ b is a silk store . &quot;
but if new York change is change , it is also curios@@ ity .
a re @-@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ term employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ ous onions .
there are Natur@@ al@@ iss@@ sch@@ plat@@ n .
the café offers no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodriguez said that he noticed a st@@ aff@@ ed current of regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were pushed forward by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road to itself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave birth to a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that there was a coffee and culture at the ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended C@@ hai tea in this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Tea 24 Bl@@ ended , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a permanent and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ar as the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he did not take G@@ roll over it , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is to create a special soap for Ver@@ b with the k@@ alt@@ ech@@ amber coffee of cafes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodriguez said that he fore@@ seen it soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ kissed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands on a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new her@@ b is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ cky and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the location of Lok@@ eren and the Order felt a new coff@@ ees like a return home .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after its ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano took his lunch at O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt had a Fa@@ ith@@ ful Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water damage .
his menu on that day was a bit modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ au@@ men@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and are both food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; from the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Z@@ iegel@@ man explained in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the Lower East Side .
your newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ n@@ ish snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered fresh vegetables with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn did eat with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the reporter Hack@@ fry ordered , this pair was appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were taken out of an ingredient and somewhat cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine , so many pean@@ uts eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ e grin@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be as lead in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male Fel@@ dar@@ es and it was served in freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were the Americans sent during the first world war , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the roads with which the country had to be moved , no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland to be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time to eat a central issue in food for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same way the new bud@@ get@@ ary was ban@@ ished : mysterious food like bread and cold poll@@ en became basic food that could re@@ compens@@ ate the casserole as a &quot; wonderful way , eating re@@ jects , because ch@@ efs in@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients were able to hide under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheap dr@@ y@@ ob@@ st .
meat , which was the centre of the American kitchen for years , became a rare serv@@ ice@@ able luxury .
strange bl@@ ends were tried out as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutr@@ itious satisfaction of the taste of taste or even healthy food was tried .
during their research for the book , which also encomp@@ asses recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a court in this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; there was no more popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ mann also leads further : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the home industry .
like never before or since then , those bud@@ get@@ ary practices - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating hab@@ its of the country .
by taking the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , women encourage women to transform themselves &quot; house@@ holders &quot; and to turn p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical le@@ ak@@ ages .
in particular , the reports about the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peas@@ ant cuisine of his kitchen , he pointed out like the million@@ th heavy man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was delight@@ ful more realistic .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , there was no interest in flavors with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House made the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most important ones prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was rejected , once the country came again on the legs .
the legacy of our continued focus on calories and food , said Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as there@@ on how science was applied to food@@ stu@@ ffs .
the couple gave to the reading the eating hab@@ its of Z@@ iegel@@ man @-@ in @-@ law to have better understood - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Z@@ iegel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind@@ shield .
after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled off and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pfl@@ au@@ men@@ o@@ ah , ate the president Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a common trick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed whi@@ pped cream , little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

killed by bombs @-@ attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save people &apos;s life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bomb attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people according to picture @-@ Zeitung .
29@@ 00 volunteers rely on their own life to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make their help in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian prot@@ ector that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the lumin@@ ous symbols in the horror of the war .
but as heroes , he never seen himself , said : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar himself fell victim to attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter had dropped four facade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , filled with chlor@@ inated gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , so that no children playing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quotes the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime must meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ ra is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland will usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swimming with a 1 km / h drive through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland will get up with 150 years of age .
the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k cru@@ ises the reason of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is just 1.@@ 220 metres far .
only when it comes , the five meter long animal accelerates to a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this one of lon@@ el@@ iness , however , seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen came from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any case of Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ rous of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life expectancy , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record .
in fact , the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist actually suspected that Greenland will become st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , after all , they live especially in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they appear usually only in winter .
researchers have a little bit about the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie .
her time d@@ pent@@ emp@@ o is , when they spread six animals with a transmitter .
prey make this shar@@ ks still : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up a pine bone of a young ice .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and are looking for ca@@ da@@ vers , from higher water light@@ ens to the bottom .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the biggest 502 cen@@ timet@@ res measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the shar@@ ehol@@ ding of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of shar@@ ks , which no longer contained in this protein .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth was to be the nuclear @-@ armed attempts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere of the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ timet@@ res the length of the third beast contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks had become normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities , which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland I showed an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k was likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females get their offspring when they are longer than four meters long .
now the researchers were able to re@@ arrange the length of the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters will probably be on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters is not acci@@ dental .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , placed an 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ pun@@ en@@ spitze on Alaska , was caught in front of Alaska .
by low temperatures frequently , the organism live there living animals on a spar@@ se .
so you tires later - and al@@ beit slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal has to be more dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible many descendants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should have to invest in a long life rather than in long life .
building site in double pack
with topics around building , the municipal council in the most recent meeting has been concerned .
by relief , the panel adopted by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the sale of the recently designated residential objects can be started . &quot;
after placing the land , par@@ cel@@ li@@ ment and consideration issues , the sale of the plots in the residential buildings &quot; street @-@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Building section 1 ) is interested in interested parties to interested parties in the way .

Frankfurt benef@@ ited from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has the best opportunities in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract new jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt am most benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the excellence of excellence and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money will continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass it is enough for the approval in the UK .
this just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Lob@@ by@@ Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and super@@ vis@@ ing the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector less significant than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank Bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a large fund of fund , cutting himself as well as Dublin in the infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to the great airport .
further points the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Seine , the rent for top @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the main page .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to a good medical supply and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city at No. 7 , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even though the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European inland market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W is ref@@ using .
London , however , despite the Bre@@ xit vote , the most important financial centre in Europe will remain in Europe .
the forces also speak of forces : in London , according to numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .

a US National Judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the right costs which you have created out of the H@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster of Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge under@@ lined a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ eth@@ ical acts .

Mer@@ ck tries to act with Gilead to preserve the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck were mut@@ ually accused and property of laboratory work carried out , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r &apos;s foundation , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax statement for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ t donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes primarily on Clinton &apos;s Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated revenues of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns of the last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine still put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ t Kamp@@ ag@@ ny in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i , in an opinion .
in a cr@@ ushing , Donald Tr@@ ump hidden behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and return to his previous promises to publish its tax returns .
it is custom@@ ary to publish its tax returns to US presidential candidate , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York businessman , and his lawyers as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control a tax examination through the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s electoral hel@@ per in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the release of the presidential candidate in the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Consult@@ ant , CNN says that he cannot allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control tests are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others , including the republi@@ can Presidential candidate of the year 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already tried that his ref@@ usal questions arise regarding power , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already been over@@ thrown on the topic and released on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump re@@ sign his tax returns .
on Thursday she said the subject also during a speech to the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish its tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump paid for two years for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax @-@ lawyers and tax advis@@ ors that could always be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a control that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et who would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called the buff@@ et whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
buff@@ ets said that he was subjected to the IRS as well as a tax examination of the IRS and dump &quot; fear &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ t Campaign has released tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , is an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ l , fire@@ work scop@@ es , Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
natural protective in Tanzania could use an un@@ orthodo@@ x species to prevent eleph@@ ants in people inhabited settlements - throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proven itself as an effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already trained the idea for years ago with the U.S. natural protection , trained by volunteers in villages in the North of Tanzania , to use a non@@ violent approach to protect their houses and harvest without viol@@ ate animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is world @-@ saving day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

Jewish Director zer@@ oes Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; Inv@@ itation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after it betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli pre @-@ election , since it would have demanded Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ documentation , &quot; Shoah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his final stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new German , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel over an own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer , which he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dis@@ sol@@ ving more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called it a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were amazed by this event and were dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very com@@ promising .
the fact that this is applied in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires the need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a rather large reson@@ ance on the internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ appointed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there had been an alleged collection of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; was it in another post that it was pointed out that the hotel is located on a very sensitive Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all the accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to record Israel in the Quick Change List , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .

students beat on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo as they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for public educational system .
the police replaced Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against demonstr@@ ators .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran in the year , grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished , the interest in the Russian company grew strongly in stores in the country , the ambassador shared with .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , another commercial building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade turn was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes for this year of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign representative of around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily by Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran &apos;s top 20 countries reached the number of tourist tax in Russia .
it could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken out of the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something , from which the ambassador is hoping that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ zed last night at the Co@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor part , who had made his country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to home a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six month &apos;s medals .
you repeated the trick after they took place in March at the railway world championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did this time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retirement a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the s@@ late , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner sat in the Quali@@ fication round a Olympics , but in the stand@@ ings the New Zealand won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du came back after his turn , but Kenn@@ y put the team forward to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategic change made a major part of the transformation , where Hin@@ des in a higher gear used to slow him , and it is Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to hold the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert in and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympic champion in the final round and over@@ thrown the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was a way that he was intenti@@ onally falling down to the railway .
he moved this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of English rival .
this time there was no problem with such a huge victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels all the GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined the last three months as a team .
we have been so bad at so many world titles so that it was unbelievable again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect our successful five days at the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y , who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( a apparently most holy day for the British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the be@@ ak of Ho@@ y is equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 year old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team &apos;s event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
Hin@@ der said : &quot; if he won two gold medals , he should be defeated to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on competition of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ven W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , who won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , where w@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought in the qualification round before the qualification , when the officials asked him to measure his body size .
in the respective women competition , which continued to be continued and finished , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald at Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a ch@@ ar to medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven down .
in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background , then the resignation of the Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s resignation in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ ings as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if you see the first night of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks very well , then the legendary reputation GB@@ S , who has reached its cul@@ mination to the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland due to re@@ vocation of the energy contract
the future of the aluminum mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game where the system operators will termin@@ ate the energy contract , and so that all delivery agreements will be over@@ hur@@ ried about the supplier of the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is scheduled for November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and in@@ direct - could be at least at a cl@@ amping .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ate effects , because it consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point of Henry melting , which led last year to a cl@@ amping of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium cord with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in the lat@@ tice Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , including the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ en@@ i Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L is that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting means , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L said that the tre@@ aties so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions &quot; will have to enter into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the income of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong sched@@ ules for wholesale prices for wholesale prices .
with the fact that the value of contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 187 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ as ... to operate the melting water or to ensure the power supply to the melting system . &quot;
the U.S. company said that there was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force by November this year , even if it is not guilty of an explanation , why it has resigned from the contract .
analy@@ st were warning due to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting of Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland yearly consume about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generators , this wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and Mother of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner Cl@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
K@@ end@@ all , brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this li@@ vers to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ da @-@ Jen@@ ner Family ) , which shows the entire car@@ das@@ an @-@ e@@ ders and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ st , as well as they ending the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turning point : you have planned any surprises .
this represents the cl@@ utch guard for almost any birthday parties ( Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; You have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a animation on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this public@@ ity .
with a view to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her to hit the Vog@@ ue Cover ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles more detail as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number of advertising strikes ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) of the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing ( 615 pages advertising ) .
the dis@@ closure of his coding stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ tive in the last two years images of the magazine still before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , model &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; passage model &quot; of their generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to the famous person or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who are aware of how to revol@@ ve a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is on her@@ e@@ ers ) .
they are truly talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like every success .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June crit@@ ici@@ zed the first Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the mi@@ ths of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ves once again , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but riding on the mixed lot seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is based on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your plan of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold out of her made pictures by Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time it is in reality TV . presumably , only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
there are 16@@ 0,000 people each year from
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid of the country will be rejected by the municipal budget , while the industry was carried out on the impact of further medium payments to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ real del@@ og@@ ations and like those who are looking for free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services of the community , which are already fully utili@@ zed , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legislation is expected to lose a further 30 percent of their federal agents .
the Director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal coun@@ cils revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would not be even worse before the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands Municipal Cent@@ res are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who rely on violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pressing debt , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ od@@ d problems - all these people have problems such as just@@ i@@ fying , they need not the help you need .
the federal government will sh@@ orten the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of hel@@ per @-@ needy people from Queensland will be forced to agree with their legal problems without any help .
we request the General Prosecutor and federal states of Queensland George Bran@@ dis as well as the Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to destroy this medium @-@ shortest , so the people need help them to receive legal problems .
last year , the state government met its promise to raise funds for legal action on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of communal centers and their customer community , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in these important work .

while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , it is not possible after re@@ frac@@ tions in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good opportunities to keep the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent .
according to a survey , the party is still just under the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left side was 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be present at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens are still hes@@ it@@ ated , despite a slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) once again in the heav@@ y@@ day of the country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 per cent each in the country &apos;s land .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD conver@@ ts only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they still get behind the Green Party at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to the pirates in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
E @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to market .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost a half kilograms and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not in the hand too .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ dom with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with a minimum of 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was born exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros you can buy lovers still on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet .
but 20 years ago , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ browser if you are too slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could similarly be opened as a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
the price was pretty proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could see in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , if not Nokia .
the mobile phone card of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented Des@@ aster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today rule the market all a lot later than Nokia .
to be online always and everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , to Samsung and Apple account of that alone 555 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment is around € 400 billion .
these are the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications corporations .
all around the smartphone has been developed in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market first came in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use with touch screen .
the triumph@@ al train from Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the view .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these passages have now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after the invention , a sel@@ ector .
on average every German today is on its mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn the smartphone even times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , responsible for staff in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and Heathrow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heathrow is not only in our local municipalities and London , but in all the country &apos;s renovation and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , that was the greatest attraction of the ranks , just like in 2012 in London , when we run a large effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be able to achieve that we create new possibilities for local and local companies in the vicinity of Heathrow .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new jobs to create 40,000 new jobs and create youth unemployment in the air environment .
so , as they were ahead of London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement of the expansion is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ elled on the world stage .
the two fl@@ utes had been wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to the survivors , but Heathrow answered every one of the question .
like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
the extension is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to leave the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £ 11 billion dev@@ res infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency test tracks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time that we turn to this Olympic spirit and turn in Heathrow as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of the UK .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that make money with online money , they come to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to a software vend@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be ad picking on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , the Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding relating to its advertis@@ ements to clari@@ fy the indication of the recognition that is part of the Site advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to avoid the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battles between the att@@ acking Open Source Community and the Um@@ bri@@ ers have already been underway since the invention of advertisement in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company dedicated for social media in the fight is a strong indi@@ pend@@ ent indication of the industry .
according to a study carried out by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , they are almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ advertising is 84 percent of the advertising reports .
the company has been on display blocks on desktop PCs , because mobile advertising block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker shared with .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue so that Facebook will appear to be worth a step worthwhile as re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that it would update its &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over it on them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters are wor@@ ried , because they also block content on the side which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no positive experience for the user , therefore we plan to address the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advertising block@@ ers are a dum@@ b agent , which is why we are concentr@@ ating on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman in suspected hom@@ icide on Swiss Motor@@ way
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected hom@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the Dun@@ kl@@ en &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the streets and were met by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 was that of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report themselves .
it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ id@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be withdrawn .
in each of the two cases - where a person in the Dun@@ kl@@ en ran on the highway - it was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to go out in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ e@@ woman was acquitted of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after having crossed a man and killed one night at the A1 nearby of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become conscious of the street .
the court determined that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- that had respon@@ ding to an emergency , -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street had an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was indeed hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once could have utter@@ ed conditions .
scientists previously pointed out that the slow orbit of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the most recent simulation imp@@ lies that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ably similar atmosphere and continued slowly .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry places than the earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to lodge life and protected by faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from an Sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow orbit of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works as a rain@@ screen to cover the surface of a majority of the sun heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles Evolution , which was supposed to have been suspected of plan@@ ers .
although it was likely to be hab@@ itable , the Venus -- during the course of several years , --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
their oceans have evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when her hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ op@@ hysi@@ cal Research .
Patrick Roy returned as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado . it led to a lower decision of determination in decision @-@ making of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be matched to the organisation .
he has also to have an un@@ certainty entitled to affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not fulfilled at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy was awarded the winner of Jack Adams Awards during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the Best Trainer of the League .
it led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Pla@@ yo@@ ffs in Minnesota and missed the season during each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
when Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ks Oil labor@@ ers take care of talks , put on strike
the labor force concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers will be exposed , while all disputes are put on the table for a new discussion round at the table .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ assed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ united in the current battle process , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop a few full day sessions in the next weeks that will begin the beginning of next year to move the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , will be a protest against potential wage savings of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has reduced the rates of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating of a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors will follow in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts of the company gives the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced his part of thousands of people and announced plans to raise its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its operations are ration@@ alized as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ ity vessel with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to the lower crude oil prices under pressure , a economic situation that caused by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament of Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the greatest labour force that took place in the North Sea since a generation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Space Teles@@ cope helped to collect the complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the constellation of Ple@@ j@@ aden .
the new data can help the astronom@@ ers why stars are rotating at different rates as well as in which connection the rotary frames are standing with the plann@@ ers .
&quot; we hope that we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is 4@@ 45 light years away from the Earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , can now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they now turn the fastest .
to top rotation rates , these ri@@ pping stars encounter large amounts of stars .
because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ igned , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each constellation by taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star fle@@ cks -- as s@@ nails .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars turn more than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turn slower than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors to be ten@@ ant to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological laboratory in order to compare these qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar press in both directions , younger and older &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much of us what we want to learn more about how , when and why stars its rot@@ ational rates slow@@ ing down and so to speak to their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotary advice of Ple@@ j@@ ads , which will soon be published in the astronom@@ ical Journal soon .
a controversial bas@@ eball star starts

after a dispute , the sperm was reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a pleasure for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will over@@ take excess of the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ men .
an experienced athl@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official dates have become known for the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish Ge@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil and immediately - immediately prior to the beginning of the oh@@ em@@ ic Athle@@ tics Championships .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tics had been proven by hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as m@@ asked funds for D@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ stan@@ zen .
on Friday afternoon time , the International Sport@@ court Court confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupies the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en could take part in the foo@@ th@@ ats over 50 m Freestyle skiing .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but the CAS for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act with the banned substance of blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ers EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is tent@@ atively suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample is already positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow told us immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ en@@ ians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men go not the right sna@@ kes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , about all weigh@@ t@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation cannot participate in Rio .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we observe a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the pollut@@ ant software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ ob@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most mal@@ war@@ es programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the information software for themselves .
only a private use was the goal , but the change to company &apos;s att@@ acking took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware is working according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of an Op@@ eller , it is searching for a long change files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the original sustain@@ ably sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the press@@ ors .
to get the end turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - over@@ sight .
but where private users can use the personal photo database on the game , it concerns sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage is damaged when a Ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even the business activities had to be completely interrup@@ ting , in case there were people living in danger .
in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health insurance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not paying , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data again .
for manager , it is difficult to refuse in view of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of a stand@@ still .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good re@@ amp@@ utation .
in a recent study , the security researchers from F @-@ Secure have examined the user surface and contact with the operator and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files .
and if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundreds of Euros , companies have to pay some hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to rec@@ la@@ ze their data .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ pressing , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the Antivirus @-@ provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , it is that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their pollut@@ ants then in the form of a software package to the actual income .
the existing malware kits developed by malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adap@@ table tool , allowing smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the im@@ press@@ ors are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly set software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
in one of the forums in the underground , the set is buying from a crime and t@@ asked another to install the software on as many PCs .
payment is made per in@@ fiz@@ ed calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the det@@ ective then sp@@ ammer with the dissem@@ ination , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies in the non @-@ based IT @-@ data processors trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be removed by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful path@@ ogens , the perpet@@ rators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ col@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this means the damage of damage , depending on type of data , a multiple higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators also could have completely new targets on the internet of things to do .
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated safety researcher how they could get connected with the Internet combined thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter the brush@@ cut@@ off of a der@@ art block could definitely be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators will block a whole manufacturing street in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could become a topic in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and easy @-@ to @-@ use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds fairly crowded , but the HR @-@ V who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , demonstrates in everyday life as extremely flexible .
although only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the f@@ ond much space , there &apos;s no place closely .
the interior materials of the inside are well processed and work pleas@@ antly , only the cockpit @-@ top falls off there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is HR @-@ V at the storage room .
it is not only a boot of 4@@ 53 l with high @-@ shiel@@ ded back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; available .
that is less magical , as it sounds : the seat areas of the back@@ bench can be used like child bo@@ ilers and provide a storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to ceilings .
the boot space can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR @-@ V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
however , his work should be qui@@ eter more qui@@ eter .
happy is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine control : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be some direct .
the equipment can be open to the tested &quot; Executive &quot; in the tested top variant .
the City notation is one of the City notation ( works up to 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the trace management system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coll@@ ision war@@ nings sometimes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he has given many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works for the remote light .
and the intelligent temp@@ t@@ controller re@@ acts on the traffic detection and dro@@ pping the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat different to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who want to invest not so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on air bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger at the aviation bridge .
for a liability be only in danger of dangers which are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed by the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs broke out in the fall of a knee .
however , the accident would have happen anywhere - it is a common risk of life , so the court .
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease incident : when is the promot@@ er
vac@@ ation@@ ers get only money back after their trip , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ s@@ ly free in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests ass@@ essing the same symptoms .
in the case of the negoti@@ ating case a family on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ eries were difficult to diar@@ r@@ he@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back on a defective cl@@ oning , which allegedly contam@@ inated sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the trip was so lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the claim@@ ers had no success .
although the claim@@ er was in fact defective .
but the organizers learned just before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then that sea@@ water was fine .
so he didn &apos;t hurt his information so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no contamination were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ gently due to infection with each other - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the refugees of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had to worry about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and decided to react to terrorist attacks at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the power of the perpet@@ rators with hat@@ red and split .
we don &apos;t give this triumph .
when offen@@ ders deser@@ ted the country , however , the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy also increases .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve an implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ digit size order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be back again under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , which will be expressed as amended , especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet .
the last much discussed st@@ aff@@ ection for doctors should be treated according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères word .
however , in the dialogue with the physician , he wants to seek solutions how the end@@ anger@@ ment of the citizen can be decreased , he said with sight about mental ab@@ normal@@ ities .
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister holds a better social care for necessary .
teachers must be better prepared for handling trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to use an investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the security further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a ear@@ nest for the hin@@ der makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel &apos;s newspapers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ition of the double citizenship earlier .
a general prohibition of complet@@ eness can be un@@ legally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t offer everything that is re@@ jects , and I will rest the tra@@ des of bur@@ ka .
to talk about rules in traffic or for witnesses against court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; green boss in Simone Peter rejected the Minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate with always new anti @-@ terror attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ fl@@ atter@@ ing Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a dis@@ rup@@ ation of the residence right bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the Autobahn
it was st@@ aff@@ ed on the Um@@ bri@@ an Road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal de@@ fle@@ ction should be extended .
this is a good news for all our motor@@ cyclists who stand at the traffic road every evening in the St@@ au , when it runs on the free@@ way of the Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the provincial road building extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th to 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Street , the right lane lane by 700 meters .
then drive you directly from the hammer to the right .
the main advantage : traffic divi@@ des up early on , reducing the total of the exp@@ ires on the complex part of the state highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Temp@@ orary Repres@@ entation Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the fe@@ eder is anno@@ ying the driver between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ day dates back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping path and sometimes beyond that .
the reason is the needle watch on the B 51 just before the Wes@@ eler Street departure street .
from here , traffic will only lead to the motorway bridge over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built over a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge has no longer necessary the necessary load capacity , especially to absorb the heavy duty transport .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that is linked to the connected st@@ au is not able to say the state of the country .
but with years to calculate : because the bridge has an official rest term up to 20@@ 34 .
for extending the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state company deliber@@ ately sought the transport of traffic in the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be launched on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the Club N@@ IMA &apos;s Society enables young people with mig@@ rant and refugee grounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das invisible house &quot; of the boys theater in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the club N@@ IMA &apos;s initiated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited 19 students between 11 and 15 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee grounds to the target , schools with welcome classes will have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most young people of the class were come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , amongst others , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the action , so the news release of the boys theater Münster .
the club N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical education project .
from October to December , adolescents with and without flight and migration background between 14 and 20 years are given the opportunity to visit profession@@ ally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal language transmission are planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of Star C@@ eil@@ ings : hoping to repair the weather
the weather was made in the southwest of Germany in the Southwest of Germany in the night to fri@@ day a st@@ rich through the bill - but there is hope .
the night was very well suited because of clouds and rain so bad , the chair@@ men of the Observatory of Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll see many stars of stars in the sky .
the star@@ ches are Pers@@ ei@@ des , which belong to the fastest star cluster with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
their names have they , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes on the Nor@@ theast .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you can wan@@ der for ever , at night , one is hours of hours , in the morning it is not far enough to think of sleep .
that is all other than relaxing .
after all , we have been with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many reasons underlying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ alth , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ering and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you under@@ stands , but is the in@@ som@@ ni@@ an , so an input and sleep distur@@ bing .
just the sleeping feel many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht tells us a board member of the German house association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
it may cause organic , psychological , or content @-@ related factors , but also medicines .
not rare is the sleep distur@@ bing of a different disease .
&quot; very early awakening is often frequent in depression , &quot; says We@@ y .
and it can be that different factors are conditional each other .
those who for example has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , however , can be bad , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ red , on all day problems and -@@ care , there is a sample .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
those who should not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week , should be imp@@ aired to the physician , do not worry .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : one is ab@@ ro@@ uted , tired , un@@ bo@@ slept , has trouble with attention and concentration , has difficulty fluctu@@ ations or physical symptoms such as mag@@ nets or heada@@ che .
to relie@@ ve the sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases , and maximum for two weeks - in@@ quire .
located in Germany , he is hardly emphas@@ ized by Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should first turn to sleep problems at the house physician , turn aside .
this can clari@@ fy with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in the sleep laboratory , and what happened ?
for the examination in a sleep laboratory , for example , in case of s@@ nor@@ ing with respiratory failure , at bed@@ time , when you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , fixes fixes .
we do not have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do no longer sleep , &quot; says Fi@@ me@@ ar .
after the c@@ abling one goes into the bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes at the body , one is wearing a nose , chest strap and a antennas on fingers .
it also shows a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of pitch att@@ acking , in which one can rely on a better sleep .
we@@ ary counts on : regular sleep and rising times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep to sleep , alcohol mei@@ den and at night not at the clock - then beginning to reck@@ on it immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible .
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has dealt with Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he brought gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put up his former ex @-@ team mate via Facebook in front of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € premium and a citizen of € 150,000 , nobody should be surprised by lack of medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conve@@ ying system in swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping control is very good .
this means that we can not compete with countries that are very much promoting and do not even deal with the topic D@@ oping , or even operate it even though .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he would have to launch a com@@ eback already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who can &apos;t be a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent control units of the W@@ A@@ DA / FIN@@ A , may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls for the Hamburg election that has now operates a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ di@@ vines arrested
professional Die@@ b at the Düsseldorf Airport
civil servants of the Düsseldorf Police arrested on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed several T@@ ash@@ ore and Bag@@ di@@ eb@@ le wires .
against 21.@@ 30 the civil servants in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf , a band again recognized the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ emen since mid @-@ July , and were engaged in common and particularly professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Code 34 , the Die@@ ben , who had travelled to Germany &apos;s approach to Germany , had four deeds .
in total , they caught a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ buildings , a few linear baths , in between still another head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ s street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first sight , but the police counts it to the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east side to the west , you come to the play@@ grounds , fresh kn@@ ap@@ y kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished as soon as it will be built : by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants .
articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the competent estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is known , however , pre@@ fers with burning cars in the last weeks .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor , are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , in particular the Berlin interior designer , the police have been demonstr@@ ating for a hard advance of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were vac@@ ated , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors to the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later , police officers and construction workers moved from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the platform in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain to the late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lived here three children , are mainly driven by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the hoods , they share the care ahead of rising ten@@ ants and ri@@ fu@@ sions .
it doesn &apos;t sound after a pine , who wish to in@@ dul@@ ge the majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ alism .
the dit@@ ch , whom the Berlin interior designer and the police make up between household companies and their neigh@@ bors , obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which even today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
also houses of residential projects and their native housing projects are already long a pine : in 1990 , many homes were occupied in the former GDR , among them nearly the entire Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under a regular service battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has increasingly become a mag@@ nets for tourists and election liner from all over the world : the inhabitants of the GDR time and former home her@@ e@@ ers are known to their jaw .
this is noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in car@@ ded slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were dropped with dy@@ es .
no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; Left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for this , that not all neigh@@ bors who think as a problem could be that it is not necessarily affected by crime : offen@@ ders such as body injury , statistics , according to statistics , is almost exclusively against police officers .
the largest part of criminal off@@ ences make atomic facts rather than the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , cannot be any speech by un@@ certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is violence against violence , the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors , those who have not been determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ s already no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , live together on the street and gets more one another , than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
therefore , it was so important that the inhabitants of the inhabitants got her way : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the de@@ structive power of the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through soci@@ etal re@@ constructions in former buildings which the ancient inhabitants are p@@ ushing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are most interesting apartments that are not interesting for many of them - here &apos;s rather people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone does never listen to anyone ?
there is fru@@ stration among all sides , also by the police and the inhabitants .
for aggreg@@ ates that anno@@ ying over color bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who comes up , should be aware of this - just like someone who attracts in a pub area that can be po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise there .
all who only asked with preliminary names have asked why not to be called with their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officers
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
in addition , she is a social worker in front of the town .
since July , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee contractor for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of administration by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact person for all the actors : refugees , working groups Refu@@ gee Assi@@ stance , Administration , Auth@@ orities , and others else .
Reg@@ ine customer of working groups imp@@ lies that the honour of honour are more than than@@ k@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ um@@ ch@@ sau , especially a problem .
so , some - less mo@@ cked than rather to the multitude of desired responsibilities , meant , as the administration wanted to write the place .
we searched for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous Woll@@ um@@ sau .
but administration is not their central area , writes An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
especially for organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine said that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ lich and the main actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organiz@@ ational , human and communication problems .
new containers in the washer soon
it has been a serious problem for a period of time to find apartments for the connecting @-@ up @-@ up , which have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rat@@ ory board with local community and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
it is not functioning until now it was possible to priv@@ ilege to private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , gener@@ alize apartments have to be ch@@ illed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the washer .
but just with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and bud@@ get@@ ary activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do not work for non @-@ profit work - and that is motivated and very ti@@ dy , such as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but this is not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop a cour@@ t@@ ant sensation .
so there are offers such as sport , contacts with loc@@ als and mainly language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so jump also here management and honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling they are desired in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes , and they can make sense the time meaning@@ fully , for example with language courses .
those who would like to get out the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never have to integrate .
the distinct majority is motivated .
there is also problem , however , says customer hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; People where nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer therefore always be to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; Mamm@@ ut@@ iny . &quot;
a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alisation before radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may be called na@@ ive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a residual risk can , but if they are not able to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sens@@ ed is the help but already .
these inci@@ dents have also been the subject of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the fear that the terror attacks they bring it completely in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honour of honour are to be visited in the region after activities .
they always have in the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question clearly said to answer the policy .
actually , it is un@@ fair to present hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we want , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the ur@@ b@@ acher has already been utili@@ zed to integrate the previous human beings .
this is currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but if humans are in need to help them , both women have to be united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : in@@ crimin@@ als searching for helicopter

the ins@@ ane was without success .
perhaps the dis@@ known were indeed close to the apartment and at their escape .
