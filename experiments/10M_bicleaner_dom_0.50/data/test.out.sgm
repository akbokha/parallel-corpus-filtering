<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - this would like Clinton as well as trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential elections, however, are in the control and energy policy as well as in one basic demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump, however, wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the state of the economy - with tax and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to rescue the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">By contrast, he would be quite different, asserted Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return Reguliarities massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax sets - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has to open the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the wealthy would be raised, says they.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">The needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost worsen.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-party Teachy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on trump there could be still parteiving discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump will build coal power plants and drive the coal transport in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction is also to be possible in the protected areas in order to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, Clinton wants to expand expanding renewable energies with their investment program: "a country will create the superpower of the clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the proprietary trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the U.S. do not want to insure from international trade, but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be better to be paid better, by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump will do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage is down, then he says he could not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, so that the budgetary deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that finished a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and an official end of the eight months long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I can not resist the pressure that Ankara will love them most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the blow, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrored and it radiated heat, even for its back conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is repeated by his "love" Putin - according to a whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved so much worse than it would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to suggest its enthusiasm rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin radiant sustainable kisses showed that the Russian government of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first, which he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow was reaction to the time in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin was divided and accused Ankara, Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The leaving was even bigger, since it was celebrated by a thought friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrowing again will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">When it seemed, the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The allegations of senior officials to have benefitted that Erdogan's own family could have benefited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria, who will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the withdrawal of Erdogan of President Erdogan who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">The advantages of an armistice are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed to get all friends who can get a coup d "état of almost his Amtes during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey brought him also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions are hard to hit Turkey - in particular the ban of batches that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal ponslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television projected fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, since its response to the attempted power of power was regarded as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, the persistent Groll take over the snowfall of the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - that is erecting to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of government won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara with security that, after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow notices a self-understandable, which itself has a deeper fear of regiment.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace made it possible by Russia and Turkey, one, as it described me a analyst to present an alliance of outer side: two countries that feel away from the West and feel bad now.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be revealed that after almost three hours of the first-discussions both presidents responded to the press conference that they had not even striped on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the President of Turkey denied it to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus that can be found in Syria, where a common denominator can be found.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as the NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now that we do not pursue global targets, but local goals.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is on the website of Kremlin (in Russian) that he later became the head of the head of the government of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of government to support your activity as a state of Chief of Staff and inspections to the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that IVANOV was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious scars.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei IVANOV was a long time one of the most engaging of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, here is the result of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">No one knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man, who once was ordained as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to large skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin who are cited on the site of Kremlin, IVANOV "it is true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated position - one could almost say - for a position to trust four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV participated in the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessionary Service (FSB), he was appointed to the KGB, the IVANOV was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called IVANOV as one of five people, whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once again, IVANOV was adopted into Putin's second term in Putin, as a third tenure of Putin would have been cast against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken from another, near allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he returned three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time to spend their leisure time, was beaded in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it's about to get people from the sofa and get more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and activities do not include any other on each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm leaving me on the Pokémon Go Wahn, an app that is based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market introduction in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days, Pokémon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smart phones outside and looking for Pokémons that are traced with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, followed by a app for Apple Watch the Washington Post announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase output.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take "30 minutes of time to get" "" "from the sofa" "" "to be active every day" "" "and every day active to be" "" "beat on deaf" "", "because many public messages are boring and are coming from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who drives regularly Sport, reduces his chances to kill cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open, that they have fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of the health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mackrical game destroys, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier succeeded to follow our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sports like this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its appeal and use the use of time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games to combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I am taking place under the Olympic Games in the Turns and that consists of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First I have been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turret, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspired to inspiring many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the catholikin, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport type.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female gymnists.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected, yet masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-class event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manna member of Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see the turnaround in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison one to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympics is only four female teams in the team. Marta Karolyi is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is so that Turning is a more expensive sport, and Turner will unite in the first line in private turnaround, which are open for training, building clothing, travel and hotel costs (for the coaches and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs that can help the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the Turner will receive their entire training and that is for families a devres and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes since then they started with the Turning.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations Aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an effective and light accessible turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have offered a free and affordable tower in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to provide high quality turbochargers that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sports art.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits to health and education and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, the thousands of young girls who are interested in love and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team and thank you, so many young girls can be motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British travelling time undergone his immune system and diggereflex of a serious test - taking some of the dirty and ecarest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk sparked his course on a Euro Schein, a banker at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwaher of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to the lever of any object, it used a luminometer to show and show us what he is turning.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to remove the dishwaher button of a train toilet which has already been used by thousands of others, but actually, in a kitchen, there are more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left what he aboutstretched, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright has been known to test the resistance of his gut by entering the world, and did eat great things as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinsets of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a kid, I was relatively unworried about my health and I have put all kinds of things into my mouth, Earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie he was justified to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proliferation showed a luminous count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to finish after their luminometres was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel movie "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "He comes to the worst, what I am in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm sorry here, because it is inside the inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company pays Mr. Wright with valio Geosus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorings that ended with us that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talk about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and poor bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumers more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the movie film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tried some of the things I have instructed to lect, as the ectory Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things, with which it was easier to bring it to Ian, and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty leakries on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio conducted by 2015, 84 percent of those surveyed from lactic acid bacteria were associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, that they may use at least occasionally products used to contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the District elections will not return directly at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="6">The locals, who are convinced by the electoral fighting, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers who are on the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are no locals, so may not choose the estate.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems come: in the holidays are helpers to spread the posters, balloons, flyers, and start out at the end of the vote, only effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to come close to the people around the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can tell at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>

<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU election fighter cocaert to his co-mates: "they must go where it wears, namely, Where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every Birthday celebration."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to become a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Socialists and Democrats were last at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD gained a clear 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Green Party, small party, with seven percent in polls, can create the jump in the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">You make a modern Tulip and lay down your election campaign into the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination boards: who are buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you get to the comment part in order to overlook him under the pseudonym of non-sensitive cowares, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reorganisation of sound plates will not be seen on a boom in millennials which would like to welcome the physical objects of physical objects but due to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate recently, according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not a hordes by hobbysamming - it has an emotional significance: older record players keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, I would follow myself during a busy street in Soho Tour, a modest grey suit and wild, before I stand, my hands hold and something burial thing such as: "so, let's throw a closer look at that."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look on it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly sitting on his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now completing the buildings where an independent seller is located - there is still a handful fantastic record company.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I by Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (data count: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20) is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I have not followed him home), dressing the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy panels, which he could not afford to buy and again items that he sold, when he sold young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, who was released when I was 11 or 12. things, with whom I was probably something young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's true that those who buy panels, rather, and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets with the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also notices a new wave of people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have caused to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations I have led, people usually have been unleashed in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their panels, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to the Appendices of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like phonica, to realize that record transactions offers a soothing community of equal innings.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to return to the stability of trusted sound insulation, retrieve objects, happy youth unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector so and I think it is so many people so much.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff of one board stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, they haven't listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news Report, I would probably look very worried, while I plowed through a stack of Bossa Nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (numbers: three men middle aged), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently joined here and said," "" "I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radio record record, so I can put it into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-lasty, less music lasty.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who are only slow to clean.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an underground audience, when I clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesis and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drens from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity to the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagious psychmata are difficult to conceive if you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for some minutes in business and consider the variety of panels for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more than a mannequin with a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, therefore the collection of plates, no real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a dearest epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders: urban Outcher.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm sure to brave the jeans-Hotpants, I think a group of young teens who grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter is thinking about to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to deal them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for these items would mean more money for the sector, and some customers could send to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov did agree, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record players who exist in reality, record shops and Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumps through record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they do not spur about the shoulders of an unsafe, 30-year-old moderator, who rises above the shoulders of nothing in middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live, settled down.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a trial hearing this week argued the authorities in Calais that the state should carry down 72 temporary stores, selling, hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would like to represent a parallel business that would not be paid by taxes and fire risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups parted the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals that are offered by the nationally supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they led out that the temporary stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary stores, but spatially considered that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are completely reperceivable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants can play a much larger role than those who live in extremely preventative conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas are peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by precipitation was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, the non-profit district, and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice to asylum items for the hundreds of protection, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "would be for this children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of Migrants estimated that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainee to the rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no engine in gold than those who want to give and what will be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing setback to the last, 220 rock Hieve, who came into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their goldenem moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting on the herd, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympics in the two-person without tax, the first women in the history of the British Sports, who laid out on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39.ter unoccupied action, which is also exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that reflect on the surface with the elegance of vibrations, which does not reflect the kind of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing there is a battalion to donate helpers, which make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads himself everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had happiness that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, taking what the interruption was to be a minimum, if that, under such circumstances, is the correct phrase.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran along the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infertility of the victory went their first thoughts on Williams, who had a nergetic morning to talk a little more than anything else and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was as captain in the Royal artillery regiment in one use in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only how much I worked, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin if we are nobody, therefore a massive thank you for him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for training or better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not be mithaged.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were really caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to be able to rip.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something of rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to have no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for one year before it will meet decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV Adventure Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">It took about six months in London to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">She accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school teacher, in the teacher's teacher, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chorus.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing praises me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the next door, they do something good with their health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the Seniors sing in chorus and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular clones you can connect the social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures are often in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to be able to arrange and organise themselves to the others, and to learn one another - a choir is a very special form of understanding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler means.</seg>
<seg id="12">The elderly and controlled breathing has a depth and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who calls his lung regularly, is not so quick from the purest in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz says from the German labor association of the Seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common Singen had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that the singing or hearing from songs in elderly people are wretched, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedlyrics and particularly melodies, people suffer for long-lying events themselves.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, the head is required for special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on their own voice and to focus on a predefined rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone, do not only be concentrating on itself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through the singing in choir, Hackler means.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing by singing in chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even to show yourself: if I do anything for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sinking people who hears it, when a tone is doing beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer you have several ways, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone sings from the known circle in an old enchyman, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">He who wants to sing in a church choir can apply directly to the church or church stand.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Who does not have access to the Internet, can ask family, friends or neighbors around the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who would like to sing, should necessarily join a choir, enigt Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing good and has something to sing - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates of the American Feldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people that keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Competition and are also in their group with the British in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group from six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place step is going to move a little bit longer out of the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Like always the game on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss through their success story, four years after they landed in the last London Games at the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team and thus began to apply things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change, and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the job of work in London that we now have.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the seam area.</seg>

<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez did the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the porters of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, it's too late, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadfast and unstable, a render run between competition and streak.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as it would be the Olympic Fackel itself a burning staff, protecting from the bracelets to the banker for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch the TV, reading a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the waiting time in the coffee shop, without about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womanage of dimples, could definitely be sent to Prime Time, based through sponsors and well-being-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even a real-man.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fought in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further away from the center, some in the shade are sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swim and may rule it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should definitely make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the Trampoline jump already an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many of whom I asked, didn't know that there is an Olympic-portart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines and had an athlete until 2012, who made it until the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese, and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trolinjump has some outside lateral eyes, partly because it sounds for the unchecked ear for a clownsschool as it sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this place I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end up - but also the grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports, which are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means a lot of" "" "jumping board." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Permanently jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and must have a number of falling movements (turning, Hgenuine and Saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed according to the official Olympic program, after execution, degree of difficulty and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-eight athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vektor is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue to go on gold, faster, upwards and above, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and back, upwards and downwards at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further cavity target: the World or Olympic Guard.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted strive is nobel, admirable, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I yourself when looking at this games as a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an respiration.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the boolinspringers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, seemingly severe as an astronaut, goes upward, then forward again, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest too, of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreaming, elegant lift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's so Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon in the streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the end-hours as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who probably is probably overseen in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness is only achievable through the Angus and the object of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to wait for the air.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters demand political changes in Ethiopia urged to violent Resistance in the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that some protesters have been killed during clashes with the police force.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ban on the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government had the country and far more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people fell on roads and requested political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was inmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were unarmed and killed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights demands a detailed analysis now." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country and even more difficult," "" "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, said the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in order to combat terror in the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, are so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has been drastically improved - there is a new embarrassing in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even when Ethiopia was other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to strike the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, although dissidents were committed to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, put to death or put into the desert in the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "when you press people and don't have any other options but it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth were protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation Protestant.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, which cover everything from soil use to worms to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread votal election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, stresses along the border to Eritrea, a fight for this peeled and controversial line demanded in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were over the last years more or less constrained, which could support the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the debiting after years of Hinkuckelns are now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate using the social media, since cheaper smartphones were increasingly more common and improved to internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially with protests, many people still communicate about Internet proxies, which hide, where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they were assembled as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orocosmos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since aeons, the Amharas, which come from aethopoly, predominantly Christian highlands come, in politics and economy while they are exploited Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we're talking to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu said a leader of the Orocosmos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trading and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unsealed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered to be tactical genius, a man who could think of the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly striking in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and special commission to edit opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively uninsured reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he enjoys not the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005 after thousands of elections were protestant by the government, according to data analytics that were stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razors, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and these days of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendanger, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month of the Protestant gondary, an amharic city, run by Tigray, and the hatred against the Tigray is always common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests against the USA and other Western allies are bringing in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenings across the neighboring Somalia, even if it had recently overhurried that they had closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West will definitely wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to break his ally in an already more volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin grave hike."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy which surrounds his campaign by taking his campaign that his repeatedly repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the Islamic State of Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions on the communication skills of the Presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he is able to be clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its Mitstrel, which endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain in the actual position of which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the suggestion at a voting event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump in regards to the assertion on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to signifying what President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>

<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on economic situation in Michigan, this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trumpet tried again to return this topic again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clint's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm into his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved to himself, when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but he said later "Of course I said the sarist."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements about enough, so that it can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted a number of their sound, since its refraction went down further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with big lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for its provocative appearance, he is accused of understanding his critics, his declarations, or his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while it is further strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes have brought his loyal Mitstrel into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant will be his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps, prominent advocators, gave great effort to defend the candidates in an CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "said Mr. Giuliani so he said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense, that in front of Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backpacks, completely false and therefore it happened, because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republican try to argue that the government used under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as an outdoor minister, it allowed ISIS permitted to spread the situation in the Middle East to control.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the voting events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and rejected them on any of his words, and to be preheated against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, juchs" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't it!"</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebra is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland will usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swimming with a 1 km / h drive through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland will get up with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland-shark cruises the reason of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is just 1.220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes, the five meter long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of loneliness, however, seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen came from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the professional journal "Science" at any case of Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Schrous of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life expectancy, which means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the evolutionary biologist actually suspected that Greenland will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, after all, they live especially in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they appear usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have a little bit about the lifestyle of the Greenland-haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time dpentempo is, when they spread six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks still: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up a pine bone of a young ice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and are looking for cadavers, from higher water lightens to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the biggest 502 centimetres measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shareholding of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of sharks, which no longer contained in this protein.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth was to be the nuclear-armed attempts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere of the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimetres the length of the third beast contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland's sharks had become normal carbon-14-quantities, which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 cm long Greenland I showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark was likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females get their offspring when they are longer than four meters long.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to rearrange the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, placed an 120-year-old harpunenspitze on Alaska, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">By low temperatures frequently, the organism live there living animals on a sparse.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you tires later - and albeit slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal has to be more dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible many descendants" "", "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor part, who had made his countryman Sir Chris Hoy and made the legend proud when he stormed home to home a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six month's medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">You repeated the trick after they took place in March at the railway world championships in London, despite the return of Hoys, just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver's Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this time as a Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement a gap to close the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the slate, which now unfolds.</seg>

<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu came back after his turn, but Kenny put the team forward to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategic change made a major part of the transformation, where Hindes in a higher gear used to slow him, and it is Kenny and especially Skinner to hold the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert in and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>

<seg id="29">This would mean for Kenny, who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on 23 March (a apparently most holy day for the British sport; on the day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister was born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held on the second day of the competition, where wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought in the qualification round before the qualification, when the officials asked him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective women competition, which continued to be continued and finished, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald at Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is on his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and pick up a char to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were driven down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background, Dramas played in the background, then the resignation of the Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and Mobbingings as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police calls witnesses after a woman in early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected homicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">Incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman laid down in the Dunklen "in an act of despair" on the streets and were met by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 was that of several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died still on site.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already been heard, but some are still not identified, the police said these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was opened an investigation process, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, divided Gilles Hofstetter to the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash avoidable?</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person in the Dunklen ran on the highway - it was decided that drivers don't have to go out in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was in the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of the Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once could have uttered conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists previously pointed out that the slow orbit of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the most recent simulation implies that Venus could have had a thin, erably similar atmosphere and continued slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry places than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to lodge life and protected by faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from an Sun, which was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow orbit of Venus is exposed to its daily side of the sun almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works as a rainscreen to cover the surface of a majority of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a story of Venus, which resembles Evolution, which was supposed to have been suspected of planers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was likely to be habitable, the Venus -- during the course of several years, --too much heat and ultraviolet light was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans have evaporated and their water vapor was burned from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the pressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turnkey code to the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin - oversight.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users can use the personal photo database on the game, it concerns sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is damaged when a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even the business activities had to be completely interrupting, in case there were people living in danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany already several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of health insurance.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say to the victims," "" "is not paying, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies have to pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For manager, it is difficult to refuse in view of the perpetrators in the operation of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reamputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers from F-Secure have examined the user surface and contact with the operator and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible support sites or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundreds of Euros, companies have to pay some hard-negotiate and five-digit sums to reclaze their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomware expressing, the hackers are becoming professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus-provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software package to the actual income.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits developed by malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the scope of delivery includes an adaptable tool, allowing smaller configurations, appearance and branding," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The impressors are then looking for further hackers to spread the freshly set software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">In one of the forums in the underground, the set is buying from a crime and tasked another to install the software on as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infized calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the detective then spammer with the dissemination," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the non-based IT-data processors trust that Ransomware can be removed by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful pathogens, the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malcolytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage of damage, depending on type of data, a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators also could have completely new targets on the internet of things to do.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerConference Defcon demonstrated safety researcher how they could get connected with the Internet combined thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter the brushcutoff of a derart block could definitely be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators will block a whole manufacturing street in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could become a topic in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and easy-to-use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds fairly crowded, but the HR-V who has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, demonstrates in everyday life as extremely flexible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the fond much space, there's no place closely.</seg>

<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is HR-V at the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a boot of 453 l with high-shielded backrests, but there is the "Magic Seats" available.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is less magical, as it sounds: the seat areas of the backbench can be used like child boilers and provide a storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor up to ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V thanks to torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work should be quieter more quieter.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you can wander for ever, at night, one is hours of hours, in the morning it is not far enough to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, we have been with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many reasons underlying, emphasises Hans-Günter Wealth, board member of the German Society for Schlaffering and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understands, but is the insomnian, so an input and sleep disturbing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just the sleeping feel many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht tells us a board member of the German house association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">It may cause organic, psychological, or content-related factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disturbing of a different disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often frequent in depression," says Wey.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are conditional each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a herniated disc, however, can be bad, wakes every two to three hours and starts blurred, on all day problems and -care, there is a sample.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who should not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week, should be impaired to the physician, do not worry.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: one is abrouted, tired, unboslept, has trouble with attention and concentration, has difficulty fluctuations or physical symptoms such as magnets or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases, and maximum for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, he is hardly emphasized by Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should first turn to sleep problems at the house physician, turn aside.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in the sleep laboratory, and what happened?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in a sleep laboratory, for example, in case of snoring with respiratory failure, at bedtime, when you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, fixes fixes.</seg>
<seg id="27">We do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do no longer sleep," says Fimear.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling one goes into the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes at the body, one is wearing a nose, chest strap and a antennas on fingers.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also shows a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitch attacking, in which one can rely on a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weary counts on: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, don't sleep to sleep, alcohol meiden and at night not at the clock - then beginning to reckon it immediately, and that's quite and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished as soon as it will be built: by 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new tenants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy neighborhood" as the competent estate company Friedrichshain is known, however, prefers with burning cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, the inhabitants of rental contracts, on the ground floor, are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, in particular the Berlin interior designer, the police have been demonstrating for a hard advance of the police against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were vacated, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and held visitors to the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police officers and construction workers moved from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the platform in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain to the late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lived here three children, are mainly driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the hoods, they share the care ahead of rising tenants and rifusions.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound after a pine, who wish to indulge the majority of police protection against vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, whom the Berlin interior designer and the police make up between household companies and their neighbors, obviously doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class, which even today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses of residential projects and their native housing projects are already long a pine: in 1990, many homes were occupied in the former GDR, among them nearly the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under a regular service battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and are still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has increasingly become a magnets for tourists and election liner from all over the world: the inhabitants of the GDR time and former home hereers are known to their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is noticeable in the rents, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in carded slices or freshly painted facades, which were dropped with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often together with the words "Left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for this, that not all neighbors who think as a problem could be that it is not necessarily affected by crime: offenders such as body injury, statistics, according to statistics, is almost exclusively against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of criminal offences make atomic facts rather than the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, cannot be any speech by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what is violence against violence, the people in the 94 are their neighbors, those who have not been determined." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, live together on the street and gets more one another, than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the inhabitants of the inhabitants got her way: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the destructive power of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: through societal reconstructions in former buildings which the ancient inhabitants are pushing.</seg>

<seg id="36">There is frustration among all sides, also by the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For aggregates that annoying over color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officers</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker in front of the town.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee contractor for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact person for all the actors: refugees, working groups Refugee Assistance, Administration, Authorities, and others else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of working groups implies that the honour of honour are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the eiving Wollumchsau, especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less mocked than rather to the multitude of desired responsibilities, meant, as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We searched for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, just a jealous Wollumsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not their central area, writes Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially for organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine said that Annika Deuschle Ehrlich and the main actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the washer soon</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for a period of time to find apartments for the connecting-up-up, which have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratory board with local community and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is not functioning until now it was possible to privilege to private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, generalize apartments have to be chilled as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washer.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, training places, one-euro jobs and budgetary activities for refugees and migrants who have to be frozen or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do not work for non-profit work - and that is motivated and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But this is not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a courtant sensation.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So jump also here management and honour.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is centrally that the refugees get the feeling they are desired in Germany and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it takes, and they can make sense the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who would like to get out the feeling he could not work in Urbach, do not work, and be unprofitable, who will never have to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is also problem, however, says customer honestly, "People where nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and customer therefore always be to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "Mammutiny."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalisation before radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what some may be called naive." "" "but a residual risk can, but if they are not able to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensed is the help but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents have also been the subject of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "they are the fear that the terror attacks they bring it completely in." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honour of honour are to be visited in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly said to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to present helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we want," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the urbacher has already been utilized to integrate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if humans are in need to help them, both women have to be united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
