the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran ans the dest@@ abil@@ ising measures in the Middle East .
but in the meeting it is said to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been silent for years .
Washington is crit@@ ici@@ zed for the adv@@ ent of the Sett@@ lement of Israel , and raises himself for the peace process for the peace process .
the deal of the two further deterior@@ ates by Obama , a deal of Iran &apos;s nuclear programme .
in March , Netanyahu was invited to the invitation of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the Congress a controversial speech which was used as a sc@@ r@@ ont against Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting was rejected by this time at the time of the attendance in Israel .
in a emergency call his friend is to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb talked with a slightly f@@ ain@@ ful voice of the police , that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officials would come to his house .
Lamb has said it important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family @-@ contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the officials made the cor@@ p@@ se of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note that I wanted to do . I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman I loved . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who had passed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , was already named after 300 miles when he was shot and killed , according to the police , a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University employees have listened to the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the f@@ ate@@ ful emergency after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when police en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ ated him .
a day after shooting at the university , students and do@@ z@@ ations forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to pro@@ cure a picture of which Lamb is motivated .
the details of the service to both ends of the state have been published , including that , what students and staff who knew him , helped out to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal court .
thanks to himself , he mentioned himself in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he shared his academic life .
both were trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers encomp@@ asses 17 members , and many of them visited courses from both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , who said , said he also seemed a bit excited and nerv@@ ously , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
accordingly , the Delta state University had asked for a call for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
in this year he has taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in employment policy of the University have calculated that the promotion , for which Lamb worked so hard for whom no warranty for an automatic way would represent a Assistant Professor in Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions which Lamb can &apos;t answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he was arrested , Lamb &apos;s self @-@ operated self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a town with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ term friend@@ ships described him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said that she was 15 and a lamb for 20 , when they met together with friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the co@@ ole older guy , who tried some years trying to teach the guitar .
it was the time of the wom@@ bs .
the ma@@ iden was sm@@ el@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ks were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificates of a marriage .
you had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the former husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they have left divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had one daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he was not hit , but because his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail I have heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail arrived two years ago in a summer @-@ century market .
later they played together the one or another one .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter , he sings her own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse that worked online for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a low illuminated bar close to G@@ auti@@ er said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time , Lamb &apos;s guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic finished in front of a sp@@ icious audience .
there was no signs of anything that didn &apos;t agree .
simply just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on clean and jo@@ king .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ ester .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , was the presi@@ ding seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , Don Allan Mitchell , an English teacher at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday night , about 900 people attended the Delta State campus , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ light commem@@ oration .
Sch@@ mid@@ wives Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ ging , during the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
hours of instruction will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police have now said that Lamb shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb is speaking at his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two had ever been married .

Michael J. Fox talks about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were looking at the theater for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty before me , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated track and a arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date .
back in time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spielberg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had a premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s true for me , &quot; said Spielberg , &quot; un@@ disputed , the biggest time travel movie that has ever been filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in time &quot; will be shown on V@@ OD , DVD and in selected cinemas in October .
UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict - and more weapons will only be wor@@ sen for millions of people .
the UN Group calls for once again all parties , including the United Nations Security Council , to unite and integ@@ rative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban concluded a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the General Assembly of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dep@@ lo@@ red that the insur@@ gency say in@@ sol@@ vable in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear strike of Iran .
8 re@@ fraction levels reveal that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to stamp him as a flop .
others have taken it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but doesn &apos;t matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top of the p@@ olls in the p@@ olls , that doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the opportunities of the nomin@@ ation of real estate business .
of course , it is too early in the electoral term .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably will probably win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts agreed that during this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys gave guidance to the asc@@ ending Herman Cain , of which none of them won only a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but the down@@ side groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s st@@ amina and start charging its dollars to overthrow it .
here are some recent re@@ frac@@ tory values that indicate that the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps meet popularity and rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate business mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
early August there were 52 percent .
out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers keep up in early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa has found that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
the GO@@ P voters are two thirds of the GO@@ P voters happy with p@@ umping than candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; off@@ ended &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son makes about the same enthusiasm as a dump ( 43 percent said they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who would say the same above tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; would be &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the son of Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely crit@@ ici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans that the real estate business mo@@ gu@@ l have the right tem@@ per for a pre@@ sidents , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is true in the first voting state of the nation , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality of a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent do not think that he would not have the personality in order to accomplish effectively his term , and almost six out of 10 gu@@ esses would say that his temper@@ ament was not the White House P@@ asse , as ABC / mail .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they rely on their schol@@ ar , republi@@ can voters are real enough for real .
when asked , those who win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation will say , after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C in the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the date , when four out of ten got their money to Je@@ b Bush .
full publication : GO@@ P voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters strike a pl@@ au@@ sible campaign .
even if Rep@@ ublic@@ ans collect a different candidate , Tre@@ gue stri@@ os even almost every one .
some experts point out that the disin@@ teg@@ rated field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , during the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between ro@@ gue and most other republi@@ can candidates , rub@@ bing the majority support .
he recently resulted in Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , especially Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of edge Paul , John Kas@@ bah and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ in @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would be competing with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump , say that they have not awarded their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 per cent said they let the door open to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the most powerful competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their opinion are twice as frequently for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with the heart of Immig@@ ration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , two months ago immig@@ rant from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; was the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ s in the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are wor@@ ried that the bom@@ b@@ astic prop@@ ag@@ ulation of tr@@ ump @-@ crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will be remote @-@ controlled by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and will damage the re @-@ orient@@ ated effort .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the questions of Immig@@ ration and Immig@@ ration .
so long as the Immig@@ ration remains in the spot@@ light , it is apparent that Donald Tr@@ ump also do .
fru@@ stration was compl@@ ained about new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile , half of the Republi@@ can voters falls , mostly through their out@@ si@@ der status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they would prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa in two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been fru@@ str@@ ated at the Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ tim@@ ental . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you can find the most expensive residence - overlooking the North Sea River .
in the street , one square meter of a cage &apos;s house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which specific layers are one square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price does not occur as well .
the real estate provider Engel and Völk@@ ers published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites with square met@@ ers@@ in to the high places .
there are several ten thousand euros ni@@ x - per square meter , noticed .
but it &apos;s good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here again not at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ speed door support in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy winner of Thomas Müller was paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it worked .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions @-@ League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start into the &quot; mission of Milan , &quot; the FC Bayern tra@@ ilers .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ l double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start of the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to pick up the dog @-@ pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller was given on 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian @-@ Department of hospitality of the Olympic champion Roberto , who had to happen as a fl@@ ank of the World &apos;s Champion .
we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m ahead of the game in the kar@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 3@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ unded fans - and the Munich kept word .
it showed a concentrated and committed presentation without sh@@ one .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal class , among them well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , too , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but the Bavarian state was defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they went bra@@ ve , but in their offensive efforts , they often seem to be influenced by works .
the attacks were often led by chance of playing on the left side of Douglas Costa , who had rarely passed against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Mu@@ eller showed more happiness than his fl@@ ank of the right hemisphere in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown , Brown &apos;s head ball from the line hit the line ( 26 . ) .
then , by direct handling , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though Bavaria comes to domin@@ ate their own game , Pir@@ ae@@ us was able to sit con@@ i@@ ding .
but at Tor@@ hil@@ ter Manuel New was aband@@ on@@ ment .
just as he had a shot of ideas about the lat@@ te l@@ ashing ( 5@@ 6th ) .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ordered a Vier@@ erk@@ raut with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems , back in the ca@@ vern , sat at first outside .
the World Cup hero only given the green light only after the end of the evening , he said : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , &quot; says everyone else . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the Fo@@ und@@ ated Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
I@@ dol was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller continued one better .
before the game , there was a Kra@@ w@@ alle stadium in the stadium .
after a smaller group of some avoided Bavaria fans flo@@ cked in its spect@@ ator block , the supporters of host Pir@@ ae@@ us had prov@@ oked with words and gest@@ en , the security forces attacked and went with whi@@ st@@ acks against the Munich lovers .
at least an Bavaria @-@ fan has been transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
but those who smo@@ kes , are not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - that makes a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study close .
good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk becomes fast .
smokers only have an increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerg@@ es from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking @-@ smokers , smoking allowed the risk of losing their teeth at pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly , in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental treatment are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ izes the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss can therefore return to frequent fl@@ es@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smokers .
do not be resolved , however , significantly increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk during short time , but the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
although it could take over ten years until the end@@ anger@@ ment again fell to the level of Non @-@ smoking , the first @-@ aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich von der English University Birmingham .
people must convince humans to be able to get smo@@ ker , explained the study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking cuts life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and leads to our insights even to good tooth health up to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by dental el@@ ess@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided with .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking will increase the risk of early co@@ oper@@ atively .
the new long @-@ term study is under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed the findings .
archae@@ ologists stop Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of the late antique country
for a repeat time on the right Rhine river Rhine @-@ bank , in Cologne , archaeological sites have been completed .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer museum sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , Museum manager Marcus Miller said on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
during all construction projects in the Cologne district of Cologne , the Museum has always been moved as a specialist department for Archae@@ ological soil preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ e@@ ologists were now divided .
from text documents it was already familiar , that in the 4th century a fortress and the 8th century have stood a church , explained in Trier .
in addition to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , who probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system by the European Commission in the implementation of the transaction through the planned trans@@ atl@@ antic trade agreement TT@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a transparent system , the controversial private se@@ at@@ isation facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be solved by a transparent system , which is clearly equivalent to more traditional courts in its function .
&quot; we want to set up a system to believe the citizen , &quot; stated the responsible European Commissioner C@@ eci@@ lia Malm@@ ström when presenting the idea .
the Con@@ din has to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade zone in the world will create 800 million people .
plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings were con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely evident in the EU states and the U.S. have jointly submitted an independent judge for a new investment in the United States .
they are supposed to come from the EU , the United States and third countries .
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow to elev@@ ate obj@@ ection to judgement .
so far , the challenge amongst themselves agreed on refer@@ ee , a g@@ ushing potential for their jud@@ gements .
in the discussion of last months , it has become clear that citizens don &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and righteousness , commented on Malm@@ ström &apos;s home .
in the long term , it seeks to work according to an international investment panel .
there , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ party arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) is particularly regarded as one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tribunal is crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ age for compensation the tax@@ pay@@ ers will yield taxes , national laws , or make a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in first opinions of recorded anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act , the European Commission &apos;s proposals are in@@ sufficient .
the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) was supposed to crit@@ ici@@ zed in particular .
the German Economy Minister , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great progress .
the Commission had strong points in the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister of Agriculture , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade minister .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration should be from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
in the case of the European business association Business@@ Europe , the European business association joined the economy to limit many new rules .
particularly small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , meaning it .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed and continued on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States .
it should initially be a framework for the agreement at the end of this year .
this date is no longer reserved .

the total audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by Stev@@ ens .
he tells the story of various places he still records on the map in which his minim@@ ally and delicate songs are reported .
where they arose , and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , Stev@@ ens are regarded as wonderful cre@@ atively .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; released smart songs which can defeat itself harmon@@ ically very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties but can drift really to the great op@@ ul@@ ent .
it arises that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a series of series : each of the 50 States Parties should be fulfilled in succession .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already appeared and showed positive expectations .
Stev@@ ens will also be reduced here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician returns to the series in New York .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Spring oise &quot; ) is an extensive @-@ celebrated masterpiece in 2005 .
shifted to ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and missing in none of the best list of music media in any year .
according to highly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served as &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with very extensive electronic distribution .
this sixth ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but collected by pre @-@ programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long of the smaller clubs , the stage shows the coat shows , featuring the colorful spectacle on Neon @-@ front@@ n@@ bands and fluorescent exposure to stage .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens are part of a five @-@ member band around Germany .
in the dark @-@ held Hamburger More !
at the end of March , he exhibits the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; which has been available since March .
even though nearly 2,000 guests were banned in their chairs , the clearly stri@@ ped Stev@@ ens return back to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
in doing so without a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician due to its broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience it is heard : the lecture is &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; and you could sei@@ ze the &quot; plate in principle . &quot;
only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens ex@@ alts himself , plays a few old songs and bowed themselves under Tuscan appl@@ ause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension was expected since his election .
the new Labour President Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to be his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings and to offer David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ cra@@ n will rise in order to present the first of its six pre@@ defined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his efforts are likely to be tested by the media and the Labour M@@ EPs .
he called for &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary trial for Mr Cor@@ ke &apos;s leadership , because she is named after his appointment as a member of the event band@@ ing and after his speech in the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them on Tuesday during the singing celebration of the National An@@ them on Tuesday during the celebration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes and stands at the heart of several cover pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has taken attention to itself
a speaker given by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England .
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told in the BBC Two news program , he advised the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his faith , that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadows ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and she is called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ ack@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of prizes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to set new Labour changes in order to limit the whole idea of limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow of the working and advis@@ ory ministers , said that the party was very clear that they only had to lower the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ cra@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory boss , over the last decade , over the D@@ isp@@ atch box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy set , says he called &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is a con@@ front@@ ational , and that it is under@@ going to decline in both &quot; impact resistance &quot; and that it has carried out serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , the shadow @-@ economic minister he is represented , if he is not taking part - for example , if Mr. Cameron is on the road abroad .
he has also brought the idea into discussion that other colleagues often sei@@ ze the word , and that he taught John Ber@@ ber , the speaker of the House , in order to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to move himself out of politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; that is often associated with the fac@@ ulty of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later , he claimed that he failed in this way .
as she was sent first in 1990 on TV , the decision was made with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his parliamentary group , although criticism has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

pounds increases by accelerated wage increase in the United Kingdom
the pound dropped immediately after data , which indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , F@@ T@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ BM@@ iller Group .
between May and July , earnings gained without bonuses in the UK by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
the percentage had been the fastest one since 2009 and was estimated at the time of an interest rate .
the pound rose by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller used the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after having been received over the rival offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world together and brands such as Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and G@@ rol@@ s .
Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods .
Ri@@ chem@@ ist &apos;s newest sales figures suggest all expectations and demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - gro@@ unded again .
Glen@@ n &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining company said that he took home $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper group MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , and with a 4.3 % decline , after Gold@@ man Sachs had put its assessment for the company rating . &quot;

the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK @-@ workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means more buying power in the potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is un@@ likely that this department force will make the higher labour cost at its company , says he .
the cost might meet expansion plans by J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer extra jobs .

it is both - in the potato mid@@ range , which the Ol@@ den@@ burg I@@ mb@@ al owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
inspired by the word &quot; potato &quot; D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the movement ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat are put together on a s@@ ke@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen randomly in television .
since then , we have been running a barbecue grill , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ cult for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the idea of Lebanese language can now be submitted to the Patent Office in Munich .

met@@ cash launches land @-@ resistant campaign to fight alco@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A stores from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale met@@ cash has started a ground @-@ resistant campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is opening two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets will expand their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show .
Ig@@ A tra@@ ders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Polar manufacturers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop owner , who sell used tickets for the South Australian football League at loyal customers .
it is expected that cash cash further details of his defense strategy released on September 29th , when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will leave his annual Invest@@ ors &apos; Day .
it is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A loads and higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern countries .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di took twelve months after opening his first markets in these two countries , and all existing ac@@ companies , but mostly independent retailers can take away .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath reported that the IG@@ A re@@ ta@@ iler will lose 360 $ million revenue per year and cash cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and generate revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and at the amounts of met@@ a @-@ high fixed cost base could cost savings of approximately $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ a market share gets lost in the Eastern countries , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently carried out survey by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and market share of 14 percent in 2015 will reduce by 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told us that met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade .
it aw@@ akes to respond publicly to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Mr Dou@@ glass has contacted the last week of cash by Mr Dou@@ glass .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which is approximately 1,200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating loss of debt with an equivalent pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler being held and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars in order to enhance sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ vor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A @-@ retailers to improve their shops due to faster @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private @-@ label goods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and load @-@ re@@ training programs in Elan are encouraged and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ aler being returned in 2017 to return for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ves more praise than criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral Damage in the shortest storm around his friend Nick C@@ oss@@ gios and deser@@ ves the view of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly and his own conduct as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his own conduct .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , who will ever be referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; made by the in@@ famous sign of C@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters into the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison who had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , where Harrison had to do : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike Egyptian and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ ushing defeat a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I rep@@ ented myself is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ man to the US Open but he is not the first player who made a bat of fru@@ strations with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of that .
but , really , he really beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very strong 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he is working very hard , and he has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , it is good in shape , it is a very stable and highly sophisticated young guy , and I think he deser@@ ves to be judged according to its own services .
He@@ aly did not support the decision to take into consideration the decision that C@@ yr@@ s. is not taking into account that begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &apos; as the right for all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as long @-@ lasting proof of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition , and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think Nick has made a very quick way to the public . he asc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , and he has made some very serious mistakes , but we try to make him understand@@ able , but we try to keep it reasonable , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , close the border , with@@ holds refugees
Hungary explained the emergency and mar@@ ched the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that attempted to come illeg@@ ally in the country . everything was with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants voted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who were fle@@ eing from violence for a unknown period of a country on the street between the two controls of the Länder were fixed and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose up .
as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and they cried out against the Hungarian will@@ ingness to sei@@ ze the Hungarian Jews .
some notes from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that there would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that migrants coming from Hungary would come back for more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a disputed meeting in Brussels , not a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crossed Italy and Greece . they claimed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special Summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a full action from Brussels or about its neigh@@ bors .
the state that rested in two southern regions defined more powers to conquer the crisis in two southern regions , so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also had the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it had finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even at the competition , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the last months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , becoming a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the incoming economic refugees are , which are looking for a better life , and not war refugees - a view that stands strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border , or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence to establish the government along the southern border of Serbia , for a crime . these laws put even higher adher@@ ents for the re@@ ta@@ iler .
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs rep@@ ortage in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still vote on the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but reporter from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on day .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the land security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by spreading the fence , they are now charged in custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are preparing to repair the fence quickly .
in Tuesday morning there , two of the seven border check@@ points with Serbia , after taking a train boat with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders , arrived .
chaos sur@@ passed the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process data from people and pressed a human being to impos@@ e there .
about 20 failed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that she would like to refuse food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nomin@@ ation on national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters during the parliamentary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second on the second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced for the presidential candidate , receives support of 15 per cent of the democratic voters for the presidential election .
more than five months before the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ics supporters are competent as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost some of demo@@ graphic groups during a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders were some winning players .
Clinton beha@@ ved a big advantage in women and moder@@ ately , but these steps have decreased .
her support for the men is significantly short , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back here .
Clin@@ t advantage of democratic voters under 50 years has pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed , and she and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
however , Clinton has a big head start with the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin at the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters so far said that they would support enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some proposals , and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are especially thrilled by her .
the views are strongly mixed with those who are currently unable to support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can elec@@ tors say this over their peak data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supporters in an open issue , why they want the can@@ did@@ acy is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that there is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is mentioned .
approval to deal with problems and elec@@ ting ability will also be cited .
since the vice @-@ president acc@@ uses a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want him to see him in the race - though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked to ask for the party their second choice is Bi@@ den at the helm .
by Clinton &apos;s app@@ endi@@ ces , more than half of them could say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far in front of S@@ anders .
decides that Bi@@ den would not en@@ code for the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head increase in advance of 20 points with bi@@ den in running at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters call Clinton to win the election in victory with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that indicates it as the &quot; chosen &quot; is increased .
nevertheless , on the question , what if one candidate is more important , Democratic Vot@@ ers call questions about voters .
similarly as in the last month , no single democr@@ atically candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate would be un@@ acceptable for this election .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the election of their party .
M@@ EPs consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and fitted with strong leadership .
Bi@@ den tops the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t is the leader &apos;s strength .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton &apos;s honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say this over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
Democratic voters are generally looking for Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
all of these measurements has no opinion of S@@ anders for a quarter of the democratic voters .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton to use a personal email address and a server during the term as an external minist@@ ration , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers will be satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their statement , whereas only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion that was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y did not affect the general opinions on its general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated further .
there are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who are predic@@ ting that the Clinton &apos;s views are worse .
although Clinton is watched by the voters of their party to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters paying them not for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of those entitled to vote , whi@@ ump , are un@@ honest , not tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , maintain good music with guide .
out of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority want S@@ anders rather than honest , but how at Car@@ son many do not have a lot of him .
the error rate for the sample rate of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returns to Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey by Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at C@@ BS News / New York Times on the latest survey of Donald Tr@@ ump
for the two candidates , half of the voters falls in the new survey , and others lose dramatic .
Republi@@ can elec@@ tors still contribute pl@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted in front of Fox News debate on the past month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son f@@ lowed in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ attended by demo@@ graphic groups and is higher by p@@ umping under Republi@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , except Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , Governor John Kas@@ bah , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins , Scott Walker , who fell to the deepest recession , with 10 % in the last month &apos;s support now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ gins at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - he lands with 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the pump , with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
taking a look at one of the last week extrac@@ tors &apos; Car@@ son found some side @-@ cycles for former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son hes@@ it@@ ated themselves to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaigns in Io@@ wa .

a private bath in the North or Baltic Se@@ as is likely to be a rather short of a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more to go into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea , this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) is divided .
the summer temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the East , it even gets up to 29 degrees .
the Adriatic river is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Bar@@ uch college , bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student during a ch@@ oral rit@@ ual , a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , M@@ ord@@ a compl@@ ain against five people .
members of the New Yorker Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ PSI seized Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during the introduc@@ tory ritu@@ als in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which contributed to his death to the police .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with band@@ ed eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack , and repeated , while he tried to turn into a frozen field on a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about heada@@ ches , and then he fell on conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ bro@@ therhood can not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was ho@@ v@@ ated and waited a hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , you had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms to goo@@ dies and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to obtain advice , said pol@@ lu@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia began to hide and introduced the good of the Brotherhood basically about the &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved himself , and he died next morning in his injuries .
according to a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt force injury to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies each year on the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
coun@@ ties and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment because of the third @-@ third order of the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with ch@@ ic@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the involved people but when an organization has - officially or un@@ official - this is not an editorial , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch college banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has resi@@ ded its belonging to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases its interest
an interest rate comes , and the house@@ keeping is getting into the che@@ ek@@ ness , return to bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
especially the history for the economy is only a low guide to exp@@ ir@@ ation .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate , and lasted for 86 months .
the aggressi@@ vity of the Federal Reserve on lifting the interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in which economy and financial investments react .
hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so fierce that investors should not concentrate on it , when it begins to increase interest rates , rather over the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could determine that all the excitement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated because of interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is un@@ likely to be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message of customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to review the seis@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a glance at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , it can take advantage of interest rates for a while .
once the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tendency to raise assets from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , reflecting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a newer trial which acc@@ esses to interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be more precise , the market is generally up@@ beat in the past 35 years - almost completely flat in the 250 days after that ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles by 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis done by Bob D@@ oll , head of the strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ded to occur later in the increase cycle , and the return on equity begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest rates promote often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some terms previously , which could not accelerate and accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 interest rates , only twice the nominal GDP has been below 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was by 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to last and forecast for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta deficit is only 1.5 percent .
interest rates in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop may be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year at an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC will allow an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading will have a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increases cy@@ c@@ lical cycle from 1950 to the present day in a super cycle with increasing fl@@ ation of GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ orts took place very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volat@@ ile , since the market has an interest rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than those shares their strategic course .
when bonds , mar@@ gins seem to change direction once the first increase / drop is done in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the an@@ di@@ aries fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to closer bonds between the longer and shorter bonds and lead to a slow@@ down in the curve .
high interest bonds often bring greater yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Cath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ an@@ al@@ yst@@ ine at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation in inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is flat , credit@@ ing have expanded , and the volat@@ ility is increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
throughout the large and whole , companies carrying the larger part of their business activity in the United States will benefit from it when interest rates rise and local products will be attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse due to increasing their products in the global market and also finance their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ ded to react just a positive three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts &quot; said in a report to the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong report increased by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ capital gains and low volat@@ ility in their shares increased their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure equity games , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising dollar .
savings could see gains through higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham
con@@ doms a member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is becoming increasingly different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also targeted at BBC Music Awards , saying that she only cited The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ College Dam@@ ien Collins opened the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader member , and increases new printing on the transmitter to prove that he does something for the private broad@@ caster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives in Andrew B@@ ingham also said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; susp@@ ect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly not to be distinguished by its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dig@@ um@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be converted to Classic FM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also targeted at the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , where you can only quote what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director proved the accus@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitor , when it comes to the public to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music making it really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and create new works , I &apos;m also really important for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey said that harder it had to work to engage in the audience when it did this in the past , because the British had less than classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing held in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , to step the commercial rival on your feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MEP Dam@@ ien Collins The Voice to the BBC - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa media at an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Judge - was produced in the special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes him to find the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s the next time to start a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to complete the order from The Voice in the future or to balance money of the ear@@ chers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to one shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday wound in spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping is bo@@ oting , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are signs of online sales to stag@@ n@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the budget for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are reports that online sales stag@@ n@@ ating , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ RG sales trend in the Guardian .
he explained that online sales were strengthened three years ago when purch@@ aser began to buy their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now , this comm@@ utes to us , and we possibly will see that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , import@@ ing from America , is cited as a reason for subsequent dis@@ closure .
experts believe that buyer will hold its purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got around their computer in order to make their line @-@ up , and some dealer websites r@@ ushed down .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could ple@@ ad against bar@@ gain , buyers can deduc@@ t that purchases .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending a little bit more than £ 1 online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases is now carried out on web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people sell clothing and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inn@@ ed cities .

Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ in during the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already noted that the p@@ add@@ in to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city will continue .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group would not have the floor standing at the time of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency in English news agency said this detail , however , said that the management of the company had forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man landed to reveal what over@@ threw the down@@ fall of the crane , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the H@@ add@@ sch , who later joined this month .
the bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of Kran@@ z , and their representatives were not at their disposal .
the Royal Decree also imp@@ acted the Group because of non @-@ current security measures , because they do not co@@ operate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes in Mec@@ ca is surrounded by Mec@@ ca native to be part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the ruler of Saudi Arabia for decades and has over major construction projects .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the budget of Eastern European crafts@@ men is over
Brit@@ ons employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe revealed a rise behind him
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which aim at tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide .
Ru@@ pert Steiner , the City Principal , correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Britain will lay their H@@ ammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified US handic@@ ra@@ fts , which carry out work@@ ings in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for stretching hands , you must appear today to a minority .
because Britain is investing heavily tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , according to the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the hom@@ er@@ kte sector , said that a large increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices has now been over@@ hau@@ led .
as a result of this , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 next Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , is planning to open professionals and close at 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are affected by women .
at the moment the men are silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to provide the growing demo@@ graphic trends which have more female single households , which can more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of males in our stores .
we need to move it faster to a balance .
generally , half of our clients choose from women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in decision process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also adopted its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company who has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious choice - variety is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women to the Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher spent a decline in the half @-@ year profit and par@@ agra@@ phs , after the Group exc@@ used the cost of the closing of the shops .
because of its trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
Fun@@ c@@ aries of a@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faithful judgment
at the Local Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball Vice @-@ Master a@@ I / DO@@ B have to respond because of loyalty and dis@@ qualification .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also indicted for authority .
he was acquitted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had been cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ oss@@ essed in their capacity for private purposes during the years 2006 to 2011 .
the damage is valued at approximately 400.000 euros .
the sports equipment must also be charged with financial crisis .
this was the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge , Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the Defence presented the defence by no time a wealth of wealth was written at the time of the association .
the sports equipment would have only applied semi @-@ damages and sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , in 2001 , the liabilities were approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( about 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the club further , un@@ locking us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , on the bread @-@ based wholesale business of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this assignment with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we raised money la@@ stly to put our life insur@@ ances as security in the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said within entry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can charge the money free , no debt may be done .
furthermore , it was possible - with the corresponding financial success the payout of the extension is retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance charges took place only years later , as of the year 2003 when an increase has been paid to the account .
therefore , the flat and non @-@ detailed predic@@ tions , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and au@@ ditions managed the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endants .
why the withdraw@@ als of the association were not explained in detail , the judge demanded .
the society was not interested in detail for the financial support , important be only the freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an audit started against authority , a sum of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were back@@ set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
therefore , the question didn &apos;t ask any answer .
then he said , &quot; He believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody had dar@@ ed anything of this money , the prosecutor placed the prosecutor in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed , just@@ i@@ fi@@ ably the function@@ ary .
this wire was formulated as a &quot; claim recovery . &quot;
why are the correct asser@@ tion ? , wanted to know the judge and the Prosecutor .
according to this , the first accused , he was not agreed with this formulation , because the club was never made any damage .
but what should I do if the lawyer tells us : &quot; with whom you are all of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a cent content , he reck@@ ons only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets , he added to the club 1,000 euros a month while the actual efforts would have been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not be determined by the accused .
they were evaluated after a test examination , in which it had been assessed all as correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ endants had had the o@@ dom@@ ed .
moreover , all of the containers are made in cash , moreover , he has to ride from his home place to the bank to stay in Abi@@ d@@ burg , he stated in his testimony .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

this will cost savings of about EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) to be saved on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about EUR 2.7 billion , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
in the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had approximately 30@@ 2,000 employees .
pur@@ ses to the Hewlett @-@ Packard share 2.3 percent below .
the printers from California &apos;s California Palo Alto is ob@@ sol@@ ete up : thus , the computer and print business is still being bund@@ led in a new company - separately from the sem@@ inal areas of computer servers and data security for companies as well as other services .
both business areas are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales , as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers according to its services , put the second biggest PC manufacturer to the world in the world .
in the third quarter of July , the sales of PC and pressure dropped by 11.5 per cent .
revenue fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues were back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
hp respon@@ ds with a split up and massive set @-@ up of changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded to it that customers can purchase smartphones and tablets rather than conventional computers , and always do more business online .
Whit@@ man restructuring plans see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 positions in total .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct investment of German soldiers on host@@ ilities in Iraq would be cast out mainly on re@@ jection : 54 percent said on the other hand , 35 percent showed themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent could be positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
against the other hand , 24 per cent have to interv@@ ene in the conflict .
in collaboration with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad garn@@ ered 51 percent of respondents , 20 percent would have been for this .
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the heart of the fair stand until the 27th September , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the public audience can visit the public IAA of Saturday .
two years ago , the organizers of Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA are expecting around 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Viol@@ ence of Serbian and Hungarian border
Hungary was used by the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ ab@@ eng@@ as and the E@@ j@@ ector for several hundred years .
Eur@@ on@@ ov correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k experienced the crash of violence at the border control point .
he told us by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line formed behind and behind the police officers were prepared .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw blocks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials continued to inc@@ in@@ ely dis@@ rupt@@ edly .
afterwards , the police used Tr@@ ab@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now gradually withdrawn .
an pregnant and apparently wra@@ pping woman was carried away from the zone .
kids who had in@@ hal@@ ed the lac@@ ri@@ lands , cried .
other refugees dro@@ w@@ ned together and suffered under respiratory problems .
the Press Officer of the Serbian Police were also suffered by injuries by the use of Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and pep@@ per@@ spiration .
time out of decision on interest rates for the US @-@ note bank
the world ob@@ serves , if the U.S. music bench is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , which was still last week of view , the F@@ ed would do this now that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and the interest rates at this present level will be 0 @-@ 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is attributable to a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only one low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can &apos;t ignore the less cau@@ stic outlook to global ratios .
she has warned the markets to decide on increasing , but the signs indicate that the chances are well against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death support at the Delta State University dismissed the exc@@ use of debt
after shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi , Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague later on Monday morning , Sh@@ annon Sullivan said a note to tell him that &quot; I do not do &quot; with the first murder and , &quot; he could not do it , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number from 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and he said , someone shot and killed someone .
in Lamb , the staff of the emergency call , said police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but nobody is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but perhaps up@@ set &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers according to his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to do this .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen trained him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday the Lamb believed that Pr@@ un@@ iss already had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss was taken by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ un@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss her daughter was &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss currently worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Herald as a close gir@@ l@@ friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ un@@ iss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; she wanted to help others people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb &apos;s relatives called on a certain date on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police officers assassin@@ ated him on Highway 1 , close to Green@@ ville later at that night , Lamb ran his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods and killed itself with a shot .
Lamb obtained a doctorate in spring 2015 from the Delta State University , which was awarded to the University &apos;s website in the course of his life .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa establishes the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large group construction .
a Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
in 150 of the approximately 1000 managers worldwide , it will cost Group construction .
in the pilot plant , there are new negotiations in the start of the pilot .
the Lufthansa reaches its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the Euro@@ wings cheaper .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is an annual contribution of about 500 million euros per year from cost and earnings of cost , divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , in the Lufthansa future , there is no longer a board of directors for passenger business .
the Euro@@ swing line should be specifically designed as low as possible .
in the board of directors , Carsten Sp@@ o@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ swing in the future .
the move of Euro@@ wings , which will be emphas@@ ized to the Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet in the future , emphas@@ izes the importance of Euro@@ wings .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airline is based under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , which puts three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tariff , with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations carried out after the judicial strike on this Thursday will again be resumed .
this was the union .
the topic of talks shall be the last resting place for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gains results &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; results are coming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between Trade Union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past months .
background is the &quot; Wings &quot; concept for the transitional provision of the pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa reaches the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concer@@ to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Frequ@@ ency International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concer@@ to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United may not play with double fac@@ tions
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven the double frac@@ ture of its right leg .
while this is the left sole holder for weeping and to exclu@@ de it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not give hope that Sha@@ w can play in this season again .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and used oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has twice a double @-@ stick and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will then be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later , and then moved to Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has a very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the changing cabin he had a view of oxygen .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ gment , the six month will last , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red map and hanging of a river .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pen@@ alised the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red up .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a giant of eleven and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United @-@ suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the European Union has an additional inc@@ entive to recover from the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player with this type of injury left the course , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sl@@ ump , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; it is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it was a very bad injury , it isn &apos;t good , &quot; said Coc@@ o .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard I can .
I feel very badly . I feel sorry for so .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also carried into hospital - after a oul@@ ding of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents should learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron , you &apos;ll be David Cameron .
as he has been asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens decided to call the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent sub@@ section , in which Cameron descended to describe the edition of the book , instead added an abstra@@ ction of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , completing her desire to see a real tree , &apos; was reading . a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ ek Geis@@ el and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet susp@@ icious enough : the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is able to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron ev@@ okes the action of the book as little . here is a rel@@ ish boy , like the local environment through the cov@@ ets , trees fall , Th@@ need stri@@ pe es , &quot; that is to be devast@@ ated in the name of the trees &apos; .
most likely , such a low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax has not read 20 times in a row after a child .
a Do@@ wning Street speaker noted that the text had probably come by Camer@@ ons Ele@@ ction Office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oun@@ ian Employ@@ ees , but there were no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened with exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you select the Ka@@ der that has chosen the United Kingdom for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing position , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not wear any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on Test level , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th , from England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is natural to analyse as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ ck@@ et@@ e@@ ers are on results .
there was no question mark with Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and that led to nomin@@ ation , as - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago , he had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control of his own dest@@ iny .
if he hopefully strikes out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance get another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss commen@@ ded his position , even if he did not receive such good achievements , and this is not surprised ; he is primarily a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test certificate gets to set its character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got in front of him while Nick Comp@@ ton took nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to home and down@@ ward .
the only par@@ ole that can be found was that England was first recorded by Jonathan in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is in the past now .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a whi@@ ch@@ man I gave up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he achieved 236 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge position , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as they get before him , but this depends of course on the team &apos;s team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to cook Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would receive an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and got four Qu@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a hur@@ ry can &apos;t beat there , and this link handed out already revealed that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not take his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is not a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he entered Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred cen@@ timet@@ res instantly and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach he was impressed by him as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think , there is a P@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup ingredients that lift their hands and the coach have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clu@@ stering supplements at the Train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as an advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the most not@@ orious guys of the game , with a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the White Ball stage of the Tour and brings energy and powerful use to the setup .
I always felt that he created for the International Cri@@ cket Contest , as a player or as a coach ; and , as Mah@@ ela , he has int@@ entions of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing mattress , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ age team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for One @-@ Day@@ ers , or was a similar rest for Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors are not the schedule .
and you must remember that , as the players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ xit stock ( Bre@@ xit = Out@@ line to Britain from the EU ) could win as a flood control unit by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ ru@@ ined re@@ negoti@@ ation strategy in order to maintain Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of in@@ gen@@ ial block , &quot; It is Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour or the TU@@ C who severely injured in Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ acy was saying that some member states , such as the EU is now un@@ stri@@ cken in various crises , such as the EU is now even created and not always created by their own debt , to which the EU itself created with mir@@ r@@ alled en@@ dur@@ ations and distur@@ bing changes that they do not want to have enough .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it will not even seem to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb onto a summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it always goes around me .
my European friend who wish to be looking for a single @-@ sided Great Britain inside of the EU @-@ Zel@@ ter - &quot; Leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ings and officials arrive in some capit@@ als up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies but she has been in power for 10 years before making it bad for them , as it happens with the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long har@@ dening like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on its re @-@ election or its creation in 2017 .
he is also a p@@ ale force .
Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain had a left wing .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are getting a leg in order to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should better be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want to have the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies .
hence , some such ministers may even anticip@@ ate some helpful remark that in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process is assumed to be my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new negoti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great Britain has won nothing of the new business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be its own costs and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ Opp@@ ort@@ ality , who made himself a name than a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all its re@@ tention , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ advoc@@ ating sha@@ king , telephone @-@ h@@ opping out@@ ages and p@@ seudo non @-@ domestic countries , possess most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir made something similar about them but established that , if one sits together with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one could get better ban@@ anas in order to get rid of it instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ iri@@ cally opposed to Bla@@ ir himself , because Bla@@ ir had turned the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , which thus opened a back@@ door .
but the press never stopped doing it .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on the back at Westminster a friendly gh@@ aps on the back - I told him that he had no time to waste any more for me - seems to repeat in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ ats Mur@@ yet Strategy of the 80 @-@ s @-@ years , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left it on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position to Europe is - I press it easy - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps , traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ de tendency and the wild backing of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can be saying yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but not Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and Television this week , when the boy sc@@ out had strug@@ gled in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was dis@@ appointment by John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow anz@@ ler .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father lear@@ nt to work on TV , loyal to his Labour &apos;s cabinet corner , without going far too far and to lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Stru@@ ggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; under all the circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s said - wasn &apos;t what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell did , even what J@@ C told his fellow cont@@ enders and dep@@ uties , after all the reports on Monday night on Monday evening .
what has always to con@@ vey the touch @-@ up image from Cor@@ by@@ n - think that he even has touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding area of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right , Cameron does not give a ticket for Europe which allowed him to maintain Lab@@ ours &apos;s assistance in refer@@ end@@ lessly to a self @-@ understand@@ ance , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are basic activities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege , its anti @-@ capitalist debate , is not just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central base of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its mult@@ it@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , rock is convinced that J@@ C will not be committed to reti@@ ring - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors .
why would Paris or Berlin turn off political capital - they have too bad elec@@ torate - to make conf@@ essions to the British when this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US has already been disappointed by the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on the power that was inspired by the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts crit@@ ici@@ ze the report of Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking , out of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et , who had critic@@ ise the authority for e @-@ cigarettes , were sub@@ contrac@@ ted in their report via e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have put the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and refer@@ enced the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month handle the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; in which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of ob@@ struc@@ tions and modelling .
in fact , this statement from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria for priority criteria ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to provide their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine content of synthesis ; the outcome of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called &quot; Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Research ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive a means of an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he has received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added her .
the reasons for the selection of the committee are not given , but also include several familiar e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which include sector financing in the paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco monitoring .
the tobacco line from P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there will be no such links or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of P@@ he said that &quot; there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less vulner@@ able than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on its cover .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique duty to make public information about what evidence is evidence and what does not , especially if it gives as much public confusion about the relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80.000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ every year .
through clear references of recent evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give in East@@ En@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said , has said the BBC should stop bringing programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the type of programs not transmitted by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to ensure that they are likely to be public@@ ally identical tools , which are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in the hard cont@@ enti@@ ous time window of the most popular shows of their rival and broadcast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , he said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he was trying for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come in contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are invited , or sends them clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee under his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting service , what I need medium or long @-@ term information for a good idea , you should make it at least on programs that do not make others or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a possible wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ri@@ dic@@ ulous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I do not see why it is a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program that could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I stri@@ ve to see how this will be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would like to reduce the BBC .
Johnson , a businessman of series , who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC will blame for the hunt for the amb@@ itions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programmes of the BBC give which the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture at the Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more non @-@ legal niche programs can go to BB@@ C4 , but they can argue with their tasks ; and they can argue when they have created all of these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them into a window in which nobody ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the radio charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I request you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions having the best value of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all think that you get a great value for £ 150 each year , but for people who &apos;s for £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be informed about the BBC to form and enter@@ tain their maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production , and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should change to the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . example , inform and enter@@ tain this . &quot;
to question the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with commercial Sen@@ dern Alli@@ ances will be available to make everything available online .
&apos; Ligh@@ tweight etics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with tim@@ ch@@ imp@@ ul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by excess of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des changing the direction at the moment in which they are singing with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses , which are to be heard for the human ear , to be exposed , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the imp@@ ul@@ ses works by the switching of m@@ one@@ on @-@ cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this subject : researchers read and write Hir@@ nak@@ ectiv@@ ity with Light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrated the power of a new method , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , used to be ultrasound in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
Srebrenica en@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths @-@ brain function , an inv@@ as@@ ure process , which gives electrical imp@@ ul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat suffer@@ ers of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ eas@@ ants react in general not to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , intensi@@ fied the ultrasound waves , which then penet@@ rate the wor@@ ms .
ultr@@ asonic scan effects on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ äle and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves carry the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells with which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic level nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani was gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their mot@@ one@@ tic acid channels can carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when he sp@@ itted ultrasound on the different creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and trans@@ mitting to the wor@@ ms , where they change the changed mot@@ one@@ ur@@ ones .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool which enables scientists to change neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that I could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to light that must be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic tissue is un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with a therap@@ ist and a therapeutic virus it is possible , the zi@@ pped human neur@@ ons is temporarily energi@@ zed for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight Golden Rules for Life in Stud@@ ents of Stud@@ ents
11 years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have made anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , slow complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in a student residence is easily accessible from a slightly fri@@ gh@@ tening up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to s@@ no@@ w : people tell whence you are coming , if you have Sabbath day and why you say &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love you , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - make questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes would be burned in fire and this extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people let you go .
the room of people often turn into drinks recipes , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they also are places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
12 . : do not remember to start working with a relationship with a relationship
introduction made a large treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is kind and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
that can be hell for someone trying to relax .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away to get the energy back , which I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a pe@@ eling is exhau@@ sted from soci@@ ability - and send SMS instead of att@@ acking an SMS instead .
A@@ pro@@ pos sanctions : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an invitation was not shut .
he saw some things .
friendship close through baking .
as you start the Uni at the climax of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cks on the doors of people imagine , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s years &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
Home @-@ made tre@@ ats offer is a good way to close friends .
her ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain himself and will close your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat make that people push their sleeping when you are lim@@ it@@ ed .
ste@@ aling food is an essential crime in student residence .
of course , the ho@@ of@@ s of chicken is a theft , but is it the take a drop of milk for your tea ?
check that with the dairy farm .
the chances are good that they are saying to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if any one ste@@ als your gear , it is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added their milk a washing up to the th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , stopping people from sleep or from job .
it is not only to be an anonymous person , but that you belong to the people in the tru@@ est sense of the giving of people who sit in the glass of glass .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours , if there were something to do them , Drum &amp; Bass leave a little qui@@ eter than it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they re@@ acted even with loud music .
when she finally heard at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours together even two hours before leaving their own music , shut off her door and went to the three hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would have been random in the same student residence ?
on the contrary , it would not be radic@@ ally embar@@ r@@ assing , if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future couple who are taking care of them , and will see them every day and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes on his own way - but if a hot fellow woman is definitely not your planned sp@@ ouse , try to address at least to your under@@ wear a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ locked room , the border is between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing out , as it seems .
a good stretch is fun , but it only takes moments until he gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
replace by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using le@@ ak on safety - but never fails to use any one room with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door , and put your keys into a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but let your hands hold on the ceiling not more than twice .
terraced houses for refugees , single @-@ se@@ wing , Ger@@ ing@@ count@@ ants
the real estate owner Markus Gil@@ dner reli@@ es in the medieval Eck@@ ental Hou@@ sing Complex for people who do not have much money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the mother and the operator alone . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believed to know how quickly the most common living room can be created : he builds in a project terraced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are p@@ ushing onto the stock market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the largest accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a large part here .
in the presence of the Refu@@ gee , we also need enough housing in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey row House is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terraced house needs at least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if people put in confin@@ ed in dor@@ al blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three accommodation units , each with four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees are saying , it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to according to the needs of the needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ es : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is of 184 000 euros , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction has lasted 6 months .
that is reasonable .
do the construction provisions make it complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : legal system I have checked my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the thr@@ ott@@ le of the turbo@@ char@@ zed special construction and the space requirements .
gr@@ asp@@ ed .
it is still forbidden , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is the space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the people living on their terraced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not correct .
but do not shar@@ pen@@ ing the competition battle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : this is true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but had been build in luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the operator alone .
I show how you can still build and build well today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking to launch the app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are in terms of the installation on problems , since they get an error message that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is going back or try to update to iTunes .
the telephone itself goes through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps , to create space - but Apple has made it un@@ likely to do this by default , if you insert a special tool to delete apps and then install it once the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your cell phone is loaded during the update or close to a charging equipment so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the telephone might be shut down , and this could lead to a demol@@ ition of the updates .

men review 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghanistan
witnesses for a incident in Bad So@@ elden @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old communist , followed by the police on his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him to wait for him .
at that time the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft station .
there are also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of those men now shou@@ ted the young man and struck him with his f@@ ist .

when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle , the last thing went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
the screening of an impact was tested on the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the last one had to be placed in a hospital for purposes of medical care .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from the left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ Ander@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ Woche , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwartz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor , Hein@@ fried C@@ bert .
in many places there are missing medical doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf against the other hand : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of rock on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ iz is going to retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor to his successor at the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Mu@@ eller opened the practice on 12th October until then he invested € 3@@ 10000 in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was symp@@ athy to the first glance , when the Fel@@ stand was met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her specialist skills in the hospital and would also come to practice in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ ash would fit well in this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I called them simply . &quot;
the couple Müller was the idea of installing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf , in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and permanent contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Mu@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as a benefit , he also see his own boss .
thus one was cat@@ chy , the gar@@ bage &apos;s bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the two @-@ point family father Frank Müller , who grew up in his medical studies in Hanover , Germany , and in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ly , Ni@@ enburg , and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior researcher in Sul@@ ph@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Executive Officer in the circle of Die@@ ph@@ olz and is engaged in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his wife of Ur@@ sel ( artist ) has specialized in the Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a veter@@ in@@ arians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the refurb@@ ishment , the rooms look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examination as well as long @-@ term and work@@ load EK@@ GS and need a talk room anymore .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of € 50,000 is given by the gar@@ bage within a funding programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality &apos;s municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality fee ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues to be continued in practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ized Sam@@ t@@ ch@@ ained mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of rock songs according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ g , in which North German practice is approximately 500 .
there is still another home practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor has been found , it would have gone .
and he who visited the m@@ iller &apos;s talk is still looking in confi@@ dential faces : takes over seven medical experts and the cleaning force of the rock climbing .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf , a era , at least the medical profession had practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , we had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Squ@@ ir@@ y@@ ausen spar@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long time , they w@@ asted little tre@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients certainly still see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband comm@@ ent@@ ingly comm@@ end : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have pushed aside myself from gardens , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the couple moved two grand@@ chil@@ ds and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also driving on our southern border , &quot; says Minister for the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border continue to remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a request for asylum is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of the people are in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs significant signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we are not accept@@ ably mig@@ rated migration flows , also not via the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel for future refugees to Austria and Germany and to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this did not see the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ nen Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach , however .
the idea of corruption is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the surveillance of the fron@@ tier - especially close to Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an outside of the Schengen Area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians want to dis@@ lock its borders for refugees .
&quot; every EU member must fill its obligations ; otherwise , the system cannot function , &quot; the Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government immediately hur@@ ried , the first refugees had attempted to travel in the night hours for Tuesday to pass to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to train the registry .
in the Croatian Police , the Croatian police managed to spread in the near @-@ corn fields .
since then local media have been meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik with new refugees .
they take care of Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the coming days , he crossed the country with some 4,000 refugees , said Home Affairs Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would then be directed at the Maced@@ onian Serbian border that had so far transferred to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media at Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade qu@@ ir@@ ons , however , that it was to suggest the people in touch with certain routes : &quot; neither we can , we want this to do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian bor@@ der@@ city of S@@ id , in the course of the day , further buses were expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria
the occup@@ ants were all around the night of some 500 kilometres distant to Maced@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria again .
this could actually be used for ob@@ servers already predicted shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; full possibilities to cross @-@ border control &quot;
the Minister of Croatia , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had st@@ resses that his country had prepared appropriate plans for potential capit@@ als for the fall of a strong flow of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details were not mentioned , but it pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it leads severe checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently been a good report due to the standard of border controls .
based on Serbian side , the Hungarian border au@@ n still stuck about 300 refugees .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who heads back to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely to the Hungarian authorities .
whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves want to go on to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic had attempted to calm Wednesday at a local moment in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stops the debates about Alternative records of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , deser@@ ted for past .
it would not take action to deal with very high refugees .
you could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - hazardous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian Refu@@ gee strug@@ gles have already begun to distribut@@ ing refugees on which there are alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harm@@ less : in parts of the conflict there are still no more significant min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the conflict .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance in the border region was sent .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result Pri@@ zes , Finance @-@ prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the rec@@ umbent position sen@@ su@@ ed its profit to a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for cargo services and higher costs in its boat transport service .
the company also said that she is planning to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers on holiday .
at that point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to take 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share was valued at 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before it opened on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told you to earn a gain of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected in accordance with a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will amount to at average 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4th , and despite the higher supplements for boat transport of serious and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said it is still expecting to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and increasing growth in online shops .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company had &quot; solid earnings when one expects the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than the rival of the Ri@@ val UPS that plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served US $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research addressed analysts predic@@ t .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.4 billion $ .
the analysts anticipated six of Z@@ acks anticipated US $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline in the international Pri@@ mary exp@@ edited shipping , which brought sales to the stag@@ n@@ ating turnover in his unit Express Shipping .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the final quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was essentially flat flat because of higher costs for bigger packages and insurance .
the Express @-@ unit declined higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher operating costs in the freight business .
at the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock varies by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , at 15@@ 0.15 $ .
on Tuesday they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table sitting around to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift up the lad@@ le for the first time since almost a decade .
above them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey seating string is located a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a memory that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues are to set up the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold order from the congress : maxim@@ ization of U.S. occupation and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed guide has recognized that there is an un@@ stable third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the unprecedented sur@@ ge by the close @-@ to @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they might continue to grow solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make this volat@@ ility to strengthen these volat@@ ility by raising the interest rate to federal bonds - and be it only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text it was not to raise the interest rate , increased im@@ certainty of around the global market enough just@@ ification , continued to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus about what the F@@ ed will do , which secu@@ res the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate hike this week .
financial markets are expected to wait for an increase in F@@ ed , with a single indicator that indicates a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists beat the strike , saying that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average le@@ aping up 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy with@@ holds the sentence within that week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
if it does , &quot; it would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t come into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest @-@ rate suggests that financial markets would have cal@@ med because it is thought of the certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to raise the set by 0.25 percentage points of this month , the first small step in a slow van@@ ishing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that they were in this year despite the complaints of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of recovery .
although the inflation was constantly falling below the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of distinc@@ tly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them due to tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets on the whole world met in the end of the month after China had upgraded its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average record fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thre@@ aten global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow Jones is now nearly 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation whenever one should increase interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy would not appear in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says ahead of waiting for at least one month to get the impact better in the grip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty on what the impact of the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the main issues of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency regime has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in the year 2013 , that the F@@ ed could easily reach its monetary expansion &quot; turbul@@ ence &quot; dis@@ sol@@ ving the turbul@@ ences around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly linked , by the F@@ ed representatives , they will not only monitor the developments at a different point but also advise by other central banks and experts to give a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of remains on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
Lev@@ ack@@ ers , a Member of the Federal Open Market Committee that sets up for an interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its head@@ line by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited assign@@ able effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives came on this cuts .
the F@@ ed should put on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis , such as the market launch in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Bank &apos;s interest rate at the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il is not coming close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would certainly not get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate because the markets was exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until the change being changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be ahead of time .

also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them , Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is her body and soul teacher .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ ences .
every Thursday she does at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger road .
in there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it is different classes as at a real school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Organisation , SP@@ RS had tried to clari@@ fy women about how important nutrition is during the lac@@ tation . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted to the breasts of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake could not be the only di@@ eting adjustment that should make the mothers .
a recent study under the management of Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ acks of the Sports Hall
the municipal budget Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2,3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ land step forward step by step forward : in the most recent municipal session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal is dedicated without large discussions .
prior to earlier , the Panel had agreed upon a motion for a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of the valid construction plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permission to grant a special form concerning the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; semi @-@ roof &quot; with non @-@ cent@@ age First and Dach@@ rose &quot; is to be erected .
background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems : &quot; thus we get a wonder@@ fully big southern roof , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the session .
at the &quot; Liberation , &quot; it is again about the roof which should be prescribed for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall will be reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allow@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the amber is usually restri@@ c@@ tive in the direction of liberation applications rather restri@@ c@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , at gym is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not make a preced@@ ent , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym at the sports centre is a community project of the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at cost around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected from school and latitude .
in the next step of the building , the building contract for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ ory department .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ve@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is supposed to be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station , as well as the majority of employees take from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the rural district , the governor of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , there will be a decision on the supervisory board , and the next Wednesday , September 23rd .
if the plans are implemented , all of the 50 employees would continue to be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be surrounded by fishermen and the further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
rooms are present .
the staff that cannot be named after Sch@@ ong@@ au is alleged to have a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic first since the beginning of the beginning and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
in the question he who should succeed , came out according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; who was ready to take over from October 1st the line and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au ship@@ yard this in every case is an &quot; dev@@ alu@@ ation &quot; and spread of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ator .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
as a result of the next two years , fishermen with his team when the Supervisory Board is entitled to bring both houses until the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ igh@@ th , which has still over 35 beds , shall be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
previously , the district planned to start in 2018 , when the ongoing renovation was completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also chairman of the board of the supervisory board , stood out contrary to that the house which houses the property in the property is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in future .
&quot; I &apos;ll close this . &quot; as it goes with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there was several reflec@@ tions .
currently there are short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better allowed us to happen , such an opportunity is not again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fischer via the Qu@@ asi dispute to the Le@@ ch , which was recorded by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have worked as a director for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) in recent decades was always re@@ threatened with closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and birth assistance .
the plot of Rhein @-@ Neckar @-@ Neckar are already staged tonight ( 20.@@ 15 P.@@ M. ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC .
the top of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal is the clear favorite of the top , but there is no occasion for the le@@ w@@ ment .
in the past season , the bath at B@@ HC occupied a painful defeat and caused something to make there anything .
Jag@@ ath with two injuries on Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers had badly injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon &apos;s day .
during the ascent on a ma@@ ize field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) there were several h@@ unters in use , like the police ha@@ sted .
after a shot of shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were transported to hospitals .
as it could happen to the accident , first of all was un@@ clear .
the Criminal Police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
Tat@@ ug@@ gets has led the police for the dead of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate since Saturday .
in the past , the 20 year @-@ old gave to the young people killed and their bodies have thrown into a channel in rock breaks .
one since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is fallen to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s bodies were found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as Public Prosecutor and police closed on Wednesday .
as a indeed , a number of 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be too reck@@ oned by the prosecutor and investig@@ ators to the place of dead bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after a visit of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , not as agreed upon at home .
when the young woman strug@@ gled out , the investig@@ ators first came to personal items of the victim .
after question@@ ing in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , a crime of crime went over the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged cul@@ pri@@ t do@@ ers then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies were found .
the public prosecutor initiated the authorities to assassin@@ ate 16 @-@ year @-@ old police officers and put the dead in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led by the port of the harbour , investig@@ ating him a total precip@@ itation .
an agreement about the circumstances should include the further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation on the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
more refugees seek for cheap lead .
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing structure is a challenge .
the mani@@ pulation in the German housing market has long begun .
with the aim of refugees and jobs from the EU , more people push for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with income tax for the last paid apartments .
in order to meet demand for paid apartments , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
on this results , a study on behalf of the Association of &quot; social housing . &quot;
by comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
14@@ 0,000 dwellings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer committed to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial alternative .
many hits the apartment market and lined up in the long legs before the ten@@ ants .
however , according to the Federal Office there were less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers in the latter year .
however , the negative development of the apartment market is not only in the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant savings in the actual building &apos;s housing policy of recent years .
Germany sliding a de@@ classi@@ fier which is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , in the metrop@@ olitan areas around 77@@ 0,000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
so many working people were living in large cities in tents in WG rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily due to the care on the apartment market longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the capital cities , the number of square metres per head fell in the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new inc@@ en@@ tives are expected to stim@@ ulate the social housing structure again .
thus the property tax may be wa@@ ived , and the property tax for sponsored apartments will be suspended .
also , according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ am@@ ort@@ isation options are necessary .
the funding programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es Administration Bank Kf@@ W is already good in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was Monday , with 184 million euros more than half of the previous 300 million euro available .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free yellow : Croatia and Slovenia are a corridor
but practically no more refugees come to Hungary , since more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the journey through Slovenia into the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to under@@ go the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees with the neighboring country of Slovenia .
&quot; I have talked with the Slov@@ ene Minister of Internal Affairs , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen area .
after the Ottoman @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees forced to Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , do practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve .
yet people who wanted not to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on Serbian border between Serbia and the EU neighbourhood of Croatia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus as well as Ta@@ xes in the Serbian bor@@ der@@ city of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they had attempted to go on foot via the green border to Croatia .
the refugees are not d@@ ump@@ ed in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
this prevents the limit strips other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the Police numbered 36@@ ff@@ led people .
shortly before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border to us as a criminal off@@ ense .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
persons sentenced to five years and death sentences in the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Authority , a total of 94 asylum applications could be taken in the border on Tuesday , including almost all - 93 - the most important transition .
among the applicant are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees detained .
however , practically nobody has granted us a view to which we granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the migrants asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
in front of the &quot; Trans@@ l@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees assembled .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the gar@@ bage , leaving the tens of thousands of people in the street in the past few weeks .
flood lat@@ tices were dismant@@ led and one of the pick @-@ up camps were rebuilt in the mar@@ g@@ ort .
no one wanted to express itself to the target .
Austria reach only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also strengthens its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still retained the country in the country .
in Salzburg some 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees came on foot .
mayor drove &quot; rock &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge feast on Sunday , when ten people stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany had surprisingly supp@@ ressed the railway traffic with Austria because of the Refu@@ gee Agency , in W@@ ern@@ stein , Germany , who immediately offered his help and ran along with two other hel@@ pers and whose cars crossed the border into the near Pass@@ au .
before that time we did not sell the un@@ trusted guests , with lunch and beverages .
we said the same thing we bring you with the car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said City in the O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ conversation .
they were very grat@@ eful .
a man did not take it to commit a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so town@@ spe@@ ople . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening at Wels , on Sunday evening , the increased train pass@@ age@@ way went up in a regional train to Pass@@ au , in order to follow the short notice that the train traffic was set to Germany , but even beyond the border .
but the regional train was put off before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge &apos;s festiv@@ ity with the Bavarian neighbours together with the Bavarian neighbours - on Sunday , a two @-@ bridge sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
by the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends more than thousands of us , a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of at the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in order to help human@@ ity , our German Chancellor ceased officially and publicly laid the position of Hungarian government into the Dun@@ en@@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of these policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now being con@@ fron@@ ted in the borders with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the poultry are forced to determine the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed us , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter , such decent conditions for the seek@@ er &apos;s seek@@ ers .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35.000 win@@ try qu@@ arti@@ le
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad , it is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to have his word @-@ weight .
the government used the earlier powerful Ra@@ iff@@ eisen bank to set qu@@ arti@@ ere to thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency department of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen have already been under control .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria last Monday is without large f@@ uss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the Interior Ministry said by a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
altogether , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 quarters were worth a year in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the numbers , 35,000 units must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide CHF 15,000 .
if more refugees should be , we can do it .
&quot; but it isn &apos;t a barrel without bottom , &quot; said Konrad .
he has led talks with the main actors .
this would have been secured to him , even for the coming refugees Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ale supported Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born and shall be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
the asylum @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ator puts great expectations on the ORF @-@ action &apos; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
private individuals can offer convenience on the platform .
in addition , one hopes on hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
in case of emergency , it cannot be that a certain amount of the temporary holder or the size of the lift must be observed .
for a temporary period , &quot; Not@@ ion &quot; would have to apply .
that , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , at the accommodation of successful ownership , Konrad Adenauer was creating Konrad with his experience .
I am an older man , who doesn &apos;t say without further to the face of the disorder .
rub@@ bing power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier may cause the republic no cost as they declared themselves .
their employees want to increase it to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ence has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with auth@@ orization .
Linz for a better distribution
not an opening of urban Spor@@ th@@ all and other building like tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the town of Linz .
this is not necessary because they are currently being able to accommodate the victims without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
other locations for emergency @-@ ability are to be tested for emergency medical emergency .
critic@@ ising the City of Refu@@ ge@@ es in the division of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts have also to make their contribution here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bavarian Minister @-@ President Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has imposed several proposals in the refugee question on Monday .
sail@@ ers has insured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to continue .
however , I give it the respective border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany be no longer readable .
the protective seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ordered more enhanced solidarity in the refugee question from the other EU member states .
the fact that Austria also leads to its boundaries to checks out checks , is &quot; a logical consequence &apos; of the prec@@ lu@@ ent of the Germans .
the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
four of the six floors of office and production facilities is the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine how to invest in start @-@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard and later also to acquired which .
starting from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ ish@@ man promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ ta@@ stic is just a matter of time . &quot;
from S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the facility , 3.3 million Euros from a Tech@@ centre , which is one @-@ third of the city of Linz , Austria Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is deemed to be leased to S &amp; T and Tech@@ centre for 60 years .
around 30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of the building in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ vert opened his second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la pur@@ ses are in the centre of the centre .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to settle a dog .
this project had to post@@ ure the 49 @-@ year @-@ old in@@ breeding of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , she has now gains in shape of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in contrast to the business in which it sells for bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , everything is about women &apos;s hand@@ bags in the Fur@@ la brand wall@@ ets are available for 75 Euros .
greater bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I took a long time to open a shop yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things , including the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a own s@@ iting location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold , done .
&quot; we are the only one in the big room of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
their fashion interests have been placed by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
it fits most if something has developed and I can show new trends that can be used .
and why some women make a hand@@ bag at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag at a hand@@ bag , neither can the trade be answered with l@@ ately security .
maybe it &apos;s enough to utili@@ ze a beautiful bag of any out@@ fit .
Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents would be called loc@@ u@@ ders .
this feature links to some of the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become President of US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for the excitement .
whether he comments by a foreign host@@ ile , journalists Rü@@ de appears or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential election ob@@ struc@@ ted the campaign levels vig@@ or@@ ously .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the Pe@@ ve@@ z@@ ian K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate markets came from .
the New Yor@@ kers with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the Wine Route .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants is related to -@@ zig di@@ ets with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the most noble deb@@ tor , Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about ro@@ gue .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow find the somehow exciting but not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the location and its famous jumps , also alongside Tr@@ ump also belongs to the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ounce the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is &quot; a little la@@ zy &quot; said Wen@@ del .
by chance of the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too high : the legisl@@ ature , says she says .
you come from the village of the An@@ am@@ pler .
the beginnings of a success story started in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigrated , and in the USA opened an eating place for gold dig@@ s .
founding of the real estate company were first property records in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return to home in the home , failed to the Bavarian state after which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once described without hom@@ olog@@ ation , he had explained the Director of the Institute for Ar@@ pe@@ eling History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , for the@@ atri@@ cal release .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rate . &quot;
this stands in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ated statements of the estate .
he repeatedly spoke about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border @-@ wall to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ pol@@ l , this is not so lik@@ able &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant route of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native of Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was bor@@ ated Heinz &quot; ) .
the hus@@ band@@ man in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so wor@@ ried . &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; the 72 @-@ year @-@ old says .
he never takes care of K@@ all@@ ye . &quot;
the pension funds in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentions that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the Church organ at a visit , which was generally well done .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine Al@@ ways of Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
you want it better if he don &apos;t des@@ erve the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the place at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ k Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as the President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of nine to take over the loss of driving licence during the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face to Can@@ ber@@ ra , in order to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today &apos;s Reviews .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Gy@@ ms struck the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ m@@ ole , took place in London as a part of a single @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role as Australian TV spectators , because Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared with Today 33@@ ,000 .
Today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last few months .
in August Today &apos;s on average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change are related to the massacres , more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for review !

the great novel@@ ties for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of &quot; By the Raf@@ a Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recent , we@@ aned father , who conclu@@ des with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics were asked if Thomson had a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained highly with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck slightly The block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe left 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot seal on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia is to be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will end eventually at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that was not able to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets To be revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki might have become un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , when Sam Wood was finally landed in The Bachelor , has been washed in great sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the remaining girls left is certainly not cheaper if they are the one who has conceived the last Rose .
but when we came with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows last day before they checked out there , you may acci@@ dentally obtained any reference to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood resi@@ sts his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left in the ly@@ ric way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you who should get the final rose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her answers could be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bach &apos;s heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quick - except themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one another relationship with one another from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and noticed ( Sarajevo ) and Sam@@ il energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is on the earth with both feet , it makes so great fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
from her point of view , Mack@@ ay , the house visit last week , her clear that Wood &quot; One &quot; could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was obvious to me that this obviously is not only a game - I &apos;m now cancelled on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked what Wood should choose ? if not she , then she was av@@ eng@@ ed .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the left girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ on had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent to an impressive training day at the end of last year of qu@@ en@@ quiries .
but Hay@@ on chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches would have banned Hay@@ on for the rest of the game when he lost a com@@ motion , as he lost the Aussie Rug@@ by League conver@@ g@@ ite during his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ on the next opportunity to P@@ unt @-@ Return and even in the current game after an infr@@ in@@ gement of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ as@@ ula continues to show its true face in the changing cabin after the game .
rather than reading his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ as@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ on even in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ on was also encouraged by speci@@ alis@@ ing team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who inspired him to keep his patent @-@ ten@@ se and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ on patented during a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings
certainly it was not the start , the Hay@@ on and his massive Australian authorities hoping for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ on left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that &apos;s done now , you only takes care of the next game , and that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ at performs the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Origin in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters call for a reduction of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees .
party and fac@@ ulty Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger appe@@ aled at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn sh@@ ur in big wall@@ stadt before a heavy crisis at the school of Bavaria , when there was not at least 1000 additional teachers in order to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get inde@@ xes in the Bavarian image system . &quot;
the regional cont@@ ex@@ ation of the Free Elec@@ toral Elec@@ toral Elec@@ toral Th@@ res@@ ume until Friday in the underground Commun@@ e .
these are very different main topics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the theme is transferred to the Ret@@ re@@ at , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the deployment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it doesn &apos;t go on , we have to say to the causes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , free asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free Elec@@ toral voters as soon as possible .
Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded that the Ai@@ w@@ anger appe@@ aled to the authority responsible for asylum applications : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger said .
the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistently regarding : &quot; we need nationwide standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria dies off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be able to handle . &quot;
but the country &apos;s energy policy will not fall under the table below the table .
a long time favourite is on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year the school of school , King Henri Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot experiment &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; with an extension of the secondary school level from three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to high school graduation .
but that is not far enough .
the topic of the G9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss .
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ n@@ asi@@ ums that want .
free drive to G9 everywhere , where it is requested .

4 people killed , after police rap@@ pers on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal under the police in a human being demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Head Office , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were assembled outside a police station , with some of them cast stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ ab@@ eng@@ as and fired in the air before she returns to rubber .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber mig@@ rating birds , from which it is known that they can kill as a less fatal alternative , obviously produced so high death rate .
the discussion was the last in weeks violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces would be formed as part of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that would want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were forced to violent disputes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces , an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed by centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature voted for this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

the planning on holiday houses on the little sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented publicly plans for the project .
some sem@@ it@@ ers are troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge .

the plans for a new holiday area lies on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the interest , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; system construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday night in the city development committee of the Em@@ der Council .

what exactly is happening on the well worth a hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .

Google launches the dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign that will help thousands of refugees to help thousands of refugees who are over@@ rolling the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the dis@@ closure of the donations call on his blog .
instead of leaving a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who has fled with her family from Kabul , said she was seven years old about her personal experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey , many dark railway and bus lines , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugees and mig@@ rant crisis has grown in Europe , many people looking for desper@@ ately seeking aid .
donations will go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised by up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / 7 will be doubled to $ 11 million .

for slightly over@@ sized diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly ob@@ ese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say whether mild overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial to the new study at j@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss therapy or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limits the body &apos;s own ability to nour@@ ish food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operations have proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were conducted at people who are disease @-@ ob@@ ese @-@ certified with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or above .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
researchers from Tai@@ w@@ &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng general Hospital data used it since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ gone this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who did not have surgical diabetes treatments received approximately at 29 .
amongst those who subjected to surgical procedure , 36 % believed the diabetes &apos;s disease and partly at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes reduced by just one percent and sometimes only about two percent .
furthermore , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ol &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , found the authors .
the researchers also over@@ looked the patient @-@ blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels during the time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , like the leader of Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ ect@@ omy Group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased results in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ burden of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier humans in Sweden , that operation continues to be a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who subjected itself to obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tested conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it was soo@@ thing for individuals with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , that have connected their body with obesity and diabetes , a reverse is really hard . &quot;
love story - in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that currently increases in the fiction : a young woman , at school times imp@@ ec@@ lec@@ tions and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets the warmth of her youth after years , and this one likes to love them .
so also in the recently published Roman &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; from Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ ha@@ y readers , since he plays in Lang@@ s@@ ler and the neighbouring villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ ler and is glad to make her home a literary monument .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe could not record all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders urged to end violence in the homeland of refugees of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be asked before the interests of each Nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ized that the response of West European countries to the refugee crisis is indeed ad@@ mir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
though the Dalai Lama reconc@@ iled Germany &apos;s efforts to stressed the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing in its countries is dimin@@ ished .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attack of September 11 and proved that the violent reaction of the USA withdrew a chain of un@@ question@@ able events .
after September 11 , I was sorry in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his mot@@ ives were good , but he set violence one , and that gave me unexpected consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increase in eating of han@@ de@@ des@@ infection by children in the past 4 years
• Gi@@ ft@@ control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years associated with alcoholic hand@@ held disinf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues from disinf@@ ection agents in children under 12 years , increased the tox@@ ins of tox@@ ins , increased from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children come increasingly often to those products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them will go into the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children do disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink while some do so , to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants will drink only because of a budget experience .
young people have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to maintain a harder drink .
younger children can be sol@@ dered by very attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange du@@ es , which are very attractive for children .
Hän@@ de@@ disinf@@ ection agent contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for infants , a few sy@@ ringe can lead to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ record centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but let people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the straw@@ berry tom@@ bs of hanging in the school , was brought into an emergency response .
her blood alcohol was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is as high as an adult , said Dr. Chris R@@ itch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in the G@@ win@@ nice Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah drew her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the not@@ ebook .
doctors reas@@ oned it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , because the girl was fallen by alcohol and pushed the head , R@@ itch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ in@@ ka Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin s mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ection agents outside the child &apos;s range .
beyond alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were related to death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the so@@ wing of han@@ de@@ des@@ infection that ab@@ stain@@ ed toxic , non @-@ clear access .
employees of health authorities conf@@ essed that the product me@@ thanol contained a fatal solution , instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in New York State , their &quot; bri@@ dged &quot; teacher , were con@@ vul@@ sed by using anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , then there was a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ de@@ des@@ infection and served them from their room .
the police looked at the failed blu@@ epr@@ ints as &quot; Gesch@@ wä@@ tz , &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authorities .

Griff@@ i@@ ths doesn &apos;t find fault about disc@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spont@@ ane@@ ously . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control as they are preparing for con@@ frontation with the Dutch stand@@ ings .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football - bo@@ red in the Netherlands - de Bo@@ er
the former High @-@ fiel@@ der and Former National players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , as there are no titles @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of voltage in the old @-@ company games , and there are not only humans in Scotland that want to see those games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a accepts that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ or , turning things to turn .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now followed with five points lead , clearly on the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already been poor times , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly - but we must go on .
we really need to take advantage of Celtic , because that makes the player better .
now summar@@ izing is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom increases .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged from 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
in the case of Scotland , the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was about 5.5 per cent , and the numbers of statistics for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed up 5.5 per cent .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell to 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I am able to be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later , except with a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is put to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ so@@ p is ec@@ st@@ oned by the poison @-@ injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses by his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and even though I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
there would be a unique perspective .
it is true that Journ@@ alists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applications are available as seats , a ma@@ ier Lot@@ tery will take place to decide who will be chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will be selected , who will be able to watch it in the engine .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit in alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close to a friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and one and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we have a laugh often , when we speak .
the prison authorities may say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of inde@@ xed my im@@ part@@ ity .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with it .
they asked that &quot; it would have to be better form@@ ulating , &quot; but it is still thinking that what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants , that an international reporter will be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , Judge of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go to all details here .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty , a lust of crime .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I think that there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will surely see him from this perspective .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other interests in which you can apply for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man in unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to intensi@@ fy him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tries to install a sp@@ ion in his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria and maintained that they led a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a racing day treatment that led the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what &apos;s best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ sample of Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had rep@@ lied 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked like a top @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say anything about it and I have eaten it on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ating that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know there was a lot .
sometimes one respon@@ ds , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I said .
I &apos;m going to go home tonight and well to sleep .
I want to go about in the shoulders , and I would like my owner fancy that I tried my best to try them .
when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
before@@ hand , Moo@@ dy had to launch the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to gra@@ ze his stud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and to give him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they believe that I am an im@@ post@@ or .
if that is the case , they would certainly be able to deal with their kidney , because they are trying to deal with me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the Route L , David Moore , the former CEO of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ un@@ dry , the current CEO of Route L , were aware of that time and are still today .
should I bring it to the opinion that it personally ?
the Route L has cra@@ ven cra@@ ck and are responsible for people outside of athletes , what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and put me away , and I have no doubt that what I say it is thinking about it now .
but I just arrived at the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me very sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Spring classes of the train@@ ers have built a cob@@ alt @-@ pilot during Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could &quot; put his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ displaced M@@ eist@@ er Black Ca@@ viar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ri@@ dic@@ ulous . &quot; after a packing s@@ lu@@ dge or sound had been applied to the horse debate , which was pushed against the rule .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees have removed the mud pits on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have happened yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday all day , so what was that way .
but it was also like the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the racing day . an inquiry into this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who deny these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; all of us see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy looks back to ri@@ vals because of ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has described criticism in the Tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites .
Sydney after@@ no@@ Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee judges the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring struggle &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett was made a hiding statement to the Storm team , after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland , the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland was not &quot; too good &quot; in the ring .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends his team , and said that it just concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading co@@ aches of his team lead him to agree , since it was concerned that they were concerned to be beaten by the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; this always happens again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson passed to Ring@@ ing , she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques across the whole year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es at a real focus , and that &apos;s doing this turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore it is probably not getting used to lose , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already strange , as it always di@@ ps again to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked and rec@@ alled the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and rec@@ alls its ment@@ or that Benn@@ ings St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 won with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he filled his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he would take care of a cra@@ ck of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and let us watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you would like to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt for making them like this .
I rebuild trust , because they tell these things because they are a bit wor@@ ried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus the root of a higher result achieved as the game bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks and don &apos;t points some cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the game maps .
when they mention us , it means that we will continue to meet in a phase .
the Storm team is free at this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland , co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the final round at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts tomorrow on the next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with $ 200,000 deposit on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence is threat@@ ening to come to the property of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine who have been mu@@ til@@ ated to Queensland , has been released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who arrested last month after the police arrested 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he was his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed by Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café might have been a harm@@ less reason .
the Justice on the Supreme Court , Peter Fl@@ an@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of floo@@ ding in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he announced the court on Wednesday .
at the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the exact declar@@ ations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Fl@@ an@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to stop him , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he returns to his Australian and his Serbian Pass to arrive at the police every day and at an starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to attract ps@@ oph@@ ile to gri@@ pping of pictures
a ped@@ ophil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g accepted the female amateur , when this was asleep , log@@ ged in an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a series of un@@ an@@ able images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately their mother .
the police looked about it and saw the five images , and analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches that used concepts for search of in@@ correct images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then maintained against the officials that he would do it , as it would lead to &quot; ph@@ yl@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet , &quot; and he said &quot; to be a polic@@ eman , to be fri@@ gh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Prosecutor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a su@@ pr@@ one to fri@@ ght people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search was performed on the computer of him , however , it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said that he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and at the weeping .
she then saw the in@@ constant pictures on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endants computer and Playst@@ ation had used to speak to girls who saw a lot younger than him .

def@@ endant Command@@ o Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since it could argue that &quot; there was no considerable sexual element in his way .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgment until October to get background reports about social work .

lock flow to small border crossing to Germany
increasingly more refugees are taken away from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many dra@@ ins were driven out of fear of discovery and arrest , people prolifer@@ ate smaller mar@@ gins
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the police officers came out .
along the border outlet Inn we have taken up more than 1,000 refugees in the rural districts Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al Inn .
they were reached on foot over bridges and shr@@ ink on the German side .
there they are taken from federal police in reception and for@@ warded to registration .
compared to the end of the Federal Police at the Munich central Railway Station , more refugees came back on Wednesday at Wednesday .
there are approximately 700 people in the capit@@ ol at 8@@ am alone , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of checks at the German @-@ Austrian border , the town reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : excav@@ ations of the storm storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Southwest awaits

the mass makes it : all two years the car at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is mainly available for the compact car , which currently is particularly well sell .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals fell according to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , all new compact models are presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra , which will be tra@@ ders at dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
to ensure that the volume model also sells well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel launches a starting point below the VW Golf in Vie@@ ws , which starts at € 17 650 .
the current Astra will be priced at Euro 16@@ 990 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse will also offer additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , to which the three @-@ cylinder petrol engine also include .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can exclusively be seen as a five @-@ seater in a conventional and a distinctive sporty GT version .
in trade comes the beginning of next year , then also a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan power@@ house wants to find its position in the highly @-@ growing segment with the new model .
this makes the compact infin@@ iti model with its curved lines full into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , the supply is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : the Suzuki imm@@ eno , also the Suzuki imm@@ eno , will make its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque lies 170 Nm ( Nm ) after the manufacturer data .
the Bal@@ eno sales launch in Europe will be available in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but all around is the compact design model DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA .
the outside laid the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ hand @-@ hand , especially hand on the front panel : here the radiator gr@@ ille has been re@@ marked and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and is the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a series of over@@ work@@ ings and new variants like the newly @-@ ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metre cell are in@@ separable .
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has provided an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel House ap@@ enti@@ ary , which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for many months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to compensation for compensation when they are accommod@@ ated into small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the victims can even trust the judges even if they were locked in to confin@@ ed spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was successfully an ex @-@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , Germany . he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of ground floor in a single cell ; the toilet was not isolated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyers , has meanwhile been on the free foot to move into a larger cell .
his mag@@ ist@@ ar@@ rests was due to the troubled detention conditions against the country in Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court took the verdict of the Chamber of the Chamber of Berlin and transferred the case to renew the exam .
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
Kammer@@ Court decides over the amount of the compensation
if from legal reasons , only a few days of dis@@ assembly for the in@@ dem@@ nity are decisive for the compensation of the period , whether there was an expression , it was stated .
otherwise , &quot; a re@@ mu@@ til@@ ation of the character of the person would be to fear . &quot;
the chamber ral tribunal shall now have the amount of money damage .
the constitutional judges generally have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they were only said in April a det@@ ain@@ ee damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 , according to a single unit , without separate toilet .
furthermore , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court , in addition to a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ case in November 2009 , Karlsruhe approved a decent accommodation .
the time pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was suspended between 15 and 21 hours each day , in a swe@@ at@@ ous cell , as in the Karls@@ bad case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also in the last weeks due to lack of staff in the head@@ lines .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness increases , even at stro@@ us , it is due to be able to appear because of the noti@@ fied situation .
according to information on the judicial point , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not covered because of offspring in 19 countries .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we &apos;re g@@ onna make the &quot;
the immigration to refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany this year , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will be coming to Germany in accordance with the statement of Deputy Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in Germany even in the position to include a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates how to demonstrate the unusual challenge : &quot; I tell you again and again : we can do this and we are able to do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany , con@@ veys the following overview .
it is needed according to the various proj@@ ections ranging from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Defense ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as ever built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all at affordable rates : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social dwellings are out of the rental connection , and in order to apply these particularly attractive apartments there are also for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is the view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social establishments have to rise and would therefore have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per ann@@ um .
the scientists and the Federal Minister of Economics must agree that it also has to give more tax advantages for investments in the residential building .
according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment and Care@@ er Research , 55 per cent of the poultry were employed in Germany in the long @-@ term .
however , the refugees in Germany were no longer required systematically by their qualification in order to help them with entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if you find jobs in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation of the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Klin@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the referendum , in Germany , it has been given a political shift : from the for@@ b@@ ade of refugees for the recognition of labour .
while there was a prohibition of asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence of the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society itself - also because of the legal actions of skilled workers resulted in a more perspective to refugees that refugees should be improved faster to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German language skills .
so far there is no sufficient offer to general and professional language courses .
investigations show also that jobs are becoming con@@ veyed most common through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore to view the integration of Thr@@ än@@ hardt from the royal road to the integration of integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few having escaped their children in the day@@ cares , it is estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root of their parents , &quot; Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ ist , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
to convince the family &apos;s advantages of the K@@ ita &apos;s advantages , the administration is distributed in various languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increased heavily by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would raise the capacity to increase its capacity , by increasing more specific schools .
students without German @-@ language classes are being prepared in the countries .
they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also taught by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ s from the Berlin school administration .
the German student union estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
however , in principle , no state of asylum seek@@ ers or thought - the only exception was Berlin , the Fran@@ con@@ sen@@ ator Frank handle ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude towards now .
study of refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a foreign auth@@ orization or Dul@@ ce do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ ers Act more if they begin studying .
the latter in general get no bal@@ u@@ per@@ y because they are not falling under the circle of those entitled voters .
people who lived in Germany had to have lived four years until now to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
students should receive immediately B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will play a major role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of its identity .
the state should be gradually annex@@ ed by Islam as the same rights as they have the churches , and to develop the existing state churches law to a new state @-@ religions ratio .
important would also be the creation of an Islamic welfare state that profession@@ ally takes care of new@@ com@@ ers .
at the right hand these are obligations .
so , the representative of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and ready to work with the state in many areas and to grant certain control possibilities .
to this end , the read@@ iness to take up their hearts towards religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chair@@ woman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern and religious conflicts could also be registered after Germany as well .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would have right now their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; said he in the Bavarian Radio .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a topic of the whole society .
this will also change its majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
in Germany , as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and general Gender Equality Act has been introduced - as a result of European decisions .
but it is very slow how the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ ance Series showed , in the police and authorities were systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the interests of non @-@ white German have long been calling for a long time and why international agreements are to become reality in the coming years when the country stay peace@@ fully and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
speaking in general , Germany has been able to supply the expected refugees to be medical , the state of doctors , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; when Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we do that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , extra cash needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery needs to pay all the sal@@ ts at the registration of health cards .
they could later be reck@@ oned with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to negoti@@ ate so many people with their limited services , to see the asylum seek@@ ers in law .
otherwise doctors make doctors to do all the language bar@@ riers .
so far , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proved , displaced stepped out against their in@@ firm@@ ities than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices need to be accepted in charge of interpre@@ ting costs .
many of them had also been helped with more gener@@ ational medicine in emergency @-@ out@@ flow .
and with another diagnostic view .
under Refu@@ ge@@ es in refugees , there are distinc@@ tly more untreated disabilities , and with young people go to HIV @-@ En@@ lighten@@ ment .
with some other disease images , German doctors headed by their formal education , however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery appears .
&quot; paras@@ ite damage or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; and as regards the doctor , he even bl@@ ur@@ red by the refugees in sight .
the Syrians were a highly developed image system , some refugees even doctors .
in order to practice practice , they must in@@ struct their qualification and bl@@ ur@@ red once again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany is psych@@ ically ill after estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therapeutic board ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) . most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress or depression .
Ravens@@ brück , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K , explains especially viol@@ ently .
a recent study conducted by TU München was revealed that every fifth Syrian refugee cause ro@@ ids in Germany to be trau@@ mat@@ ised .
who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress level , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs , with respiratory problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart tur@@ f , and death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , severe rec@@ u@@ per@@ ance and emotional Tau@@ ber .
to prevent the symptoms of chron@@ ically , an early treatment may be necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put a request for psycho@@ therapy , however , the treatment usually takes several months .
moreover , in the social com@@ part@@ ments , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental diseases would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current control stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family .
the gift to delight lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to pick up the people out of their everyday practices and take them for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year old juni@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; st@@ resses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cu@@ res are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; don &apos;t let our beasts go well , don &apos;t let us well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five continents will enjoy each string .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read from their eyes after the possibility of every desire .
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel good , it does not want to be in the arena .
so the upper commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on her Zeb@@ ra jum@@ bo , a mix of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ ster , the family is proud .
the two animals have lived together eight years in a c@@ row and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was here &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mascot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .

Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , the oldest of Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the steps at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also ensured by the asser@@ tions of dep@@ uties of the opposition that it had been warned by anonymous security thre@@ ats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe and Bu@@ hr@@ ine by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they threatened him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opponents have received SMS messages to their cell phones that warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she warns against the affected Parliament of Parliament that the immun@@ ity ends in Parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer valid .
chief speaker , that led by Morgan Sun@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is concerned about the dangers for the politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to develop 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
in this year , HP will split up into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and its services business .
the expected vac@@ ancies lead to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , more competitive cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which is to lead the unit after the separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is today , and we have a broad and a broad portfolio of shops where companies support the transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing an integrated technology solutions to companies , &quot; an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company which was founded in the 1930s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill and Dave Packard , to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive re@@ structure to handle the return of traditional computers into mobile devices .
the work of HP , the world &apos;s second largest computer manufacturer , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on belief that closely foc@@ ussed on companies achieve better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed by Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is not until September and when his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optimi@@ stic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and owing to its history , its participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate rat@@ chet viol@@ ate and then returned to its old s@@ ash during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , who healed not well .
this is no matter of matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
that may be from purely biological point of sight , but such as Wen@@ ger , there are the associated risk of further injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries declined 23 different ill@@ nesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he played in only 65 out of Ukraine as 157 Lig@@ asp@@ en in the last five game times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs were one of the most vulner@@ able days to be recorded .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s cancer , but Arsenal believed that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability quota will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a time period , a time in which you rein@@ force your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the way he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a press within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , what means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to renew a little water break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
though Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are continuing due to group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday night and was measured at the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had bred the lesson of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains un@@ au@@ d@@ led by far spent hope , with his management the club to lead the club to his first European Cup .
&quot; this power@@ plant is immen@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it never worked with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ eless .
friendship : the comedy show , who has given us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now even more dou@@ bling than ever before , such as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high@@ s .
in 2013 , it was the most important death cause in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ man ( CA@@ LM - Campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) 2015 announced the year of the man to question the culture with the aim of searching for the culture if they need them .
friendship is the heart of battle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symptoms showed that if suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had to doubled its opportunities for enjoyment .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends reduce the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of over social media led communication , with its main emphasis on style about substance , the in@@ visibility of response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to sound strong , fun and successful , even if the isolation is dominated in reality .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists understand exotic values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship which seems to have a much more pro@@ found on our mental health .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire announced recently , money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
each character has not been defined by his work , but by its personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football gu@@ ins in cosy st@@ ills and the desire of Ross into Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can refer to each case even if they often have back to explore completely their feelings .
as a staff of telephone past@@ oral care explained me to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed these de@@ pressed will have shown me clearly , as even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phr@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to righ@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me if I try to offer long @-@ time fun@@ er@@ work mechanisms .
it definitely presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so very my objective side status via the telephone boo@@ ze human beings in the eyes of desp@@ air even may help support long @-@ term support from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with the celebration of the day completely redesigned back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks one alone , give him a smile and tell him hello .
you never know what the difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets artists to help PS@@ G , Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and dir@@ son Cav@@ ani after winning Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help PS@@ G acting in Malmö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh , Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the self @-@ park@@ land stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met fewer than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion on the way , but afterwards it missed a number of occasions , before they finally increased its lead , as Cav@@ ani scored one head goal in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes Paris a strong start@@ up against the Swedish champion since it did not only want to achieve the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ an &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed chance in front of the goal . he later became in play against his home @-@ home team and against the association , which he began his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause problems and to look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things we need to finish in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a good occurr@@ ence .
we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret it that we did not have scored one or another goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three major changes to the Paris team that was held on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place versus Bordeaux in the First League , but he was arranged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ian wing @-@ wing was known as the man who was to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , when he arrived in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö Defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ d &apos;s long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off hit to achieve this level , appeared at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was suddenly excited by a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the middle field .
but except for a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ reading P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute they moved little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes appeared on , with some mis@@ alignment and bad dis@@ closures , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic containing no less than five trials in the first half alone and abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by kir@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria into a fil@@ ming that was driven by Wil@@ d at the pace in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
finally , the second gate was finally dropped thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans , thus , thus achieved his sixth season open@@ er after whi@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malmö in the game can come back , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could stop the final result before replacement of E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , was later that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was in December last year .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not match . &quot;
hat off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented the change in 2008 to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ ling Sports Club in Qatar , summer 2015
the FC Bayern obviously stood some years ago prior to the obligation of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then playing for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times winner Champions League winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years , and switched to the al @-@ S@@ ling Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi is now av@@ al@@ able that it was already standing before the EM stand in front of the EM in 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid , at that time , won everything , &quot; he tells .
and the already known FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ an@@ ig@@ ning wanted me to have . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the change was not finished .
the young man now works for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi is expl@@ aining why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP has told me that I would not have to change that he could not imagine the team . &quot;
&quot; that he has prov@@ oked me . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film sequences .
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front@@ al the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ makers Eff@@ ie Brown as a discussion on the variety and said they will not need behind the scenes .
during one episode of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light broke out the experienced actor Brown as this was the need of alternative perspectives and in regards to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it at the lin@@ eup of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted to shock with in@@ accurate un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ tian resigned .
Dam@@ on and Brown followed the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to re@@ think people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - like to treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a Nut@@ ley who is beaten by its white people .
the producer of De@@ er White People continued for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting right to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direc@@ ting &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired , Social Media explo@@ ded over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter player Mr Po@@ oni put his anger via the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; on the only black person in the room , so it can explain its diversity - it is SO WE@@ ISS that it hurt . &quot;
the twe@@ eter earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 practices since its release .
women &apos;s comments are at a time to represent the exact r@@ ass@@ al representation in the media at the top of social discussion .
after the teenage marriage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves was strengthened by country , and urged bills and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ ating practices on colour@@ ing .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; you haven &apos;t matter &quot; ( albums still have their mean@@ ings ) , he said .
as books and black life , albums still have their importance .
in younger time , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News , Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the Group should be considered a hat@@ red group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was based on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media reviews that are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the manifest@@ ation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he has accepted the invitation or met the Pope , is un@@ clear .

professional sport climbed and service aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million by home .
the competition show , which finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could shut off all the steps of his obst@@ acle course .
during the course of the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
climbing for the last task the climbing in a 75 feet long climb@@ s in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time when he was the first athl@@ ete who completed the challenging Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which he made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock against winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E said about his bun@@ ch money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so much suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed set himself with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he completed the course of the course , did not receive any prize money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it receives one of the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , he receives the great property .
I don &apos;t think he will make any G@@ roll .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the crowds of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be sm@@ itten one by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac had just had to feel the re@@ els .
America nin@@ ja Warrior League has been extended to a season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers close to Minnesota &apos;s T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today &apos;s Tig@@ ers are waiting for the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday against the Minnesota &apos;s T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
the T@@ wins had a chance to climb up for the first half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , even though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that had so difficult to deal with a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ P@@ it@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support to su@@ stain three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth , and then in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three R@@ uns .
it was only its third successful start in its last nine games .
&quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ ball each game , and so I want to concentrate on it into the game .
the design@@ ni@@ ated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two guns , his first R@@ B@@ Is in mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle naval battle on July 6 .
he spar@@ ked the impact wood , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good during ( strength training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ seye , and he brought it directly to the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh day the T@@ wins had their best chance to win back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the signing with a double on the left line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a bun@@ tu , and Simon brought his second basic man Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the Bla@@ de Har@@ dy &apos;s Link@@ sh@@ ouse .
it came down on the wall , the only man who had con@@ fron@@ ted with whom he was con@@ fron@@ ted with the ro@@ ok@@ es@@ ro@@ ok@@ ie Kro@@ mann @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who is a two @-@ run Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of buyers and the closing @-@ run with the second brought the third b@@ ump@@ kin Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ cher at a Double Play .
it was the major league over the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe took a Double Play
after Detroit added an active event at the end of the ninth inner city , a R@@ B@@ I double against the de@@ bac@@ le of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don took up the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , called S@@ ano with three pen@@ it@@ ches for his Fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by a still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers met three R@@ uns in the first two lat@@ ings against the sp@@ lit@@ ch@@ ings veter@@ an that had been eliminated in front of the game , after having had more than one month due to a back@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I w@@ ished for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt decent when I wanted to get some good cou@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ und@@ red gave a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a &apos; Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z won his 0 @-@ 21 winning series in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third B@@ rel@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right side with a single run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which finished the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid up in the second , one One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t sm@@ ite well , but he sm@@ ells the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a pitch Count , no points scored in the third inning , before it was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strips .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated because of an infr@@ in@@ gement number .
he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who performed the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ able list due to a shoulder cut , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sán@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is canc@@ eled by the injuries list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 for four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired for the exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been ro@@ th@@ ed since the 20th August due to a tie in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is playing against that in Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Santana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should come into Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this would not take place in thinking about military action options , not without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European countries &quot; collective way@@ mark . &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls southern and Eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again introduced contrast to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on the Austrian TV station on Tuesday , after Hungary , no one was sent to Hungary .
Germany , too , did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she declared .
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said : there have already been speaking talks between the Director @-@ General Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her and directed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin on Wednesday .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria , so that tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann submitted a special Summit on the next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary switching controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states so far not have a common anticip@@ ation in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU interior ministers want to take a new con@@ centric run for binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees .
given the strong Refu@@ gee Council in Germany , the federal government wants to grow stronger the countries for the first and distribution of people .
the alliance will participate in cooperation with the Länder , leaving Merkel on the late afternoon party after almost four hours of consultations with the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who would protect the protection , would like this .
but I cannot stay in Germany nor stay in Germany .
this idea was to be expressed in the lap .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has stressed the state as a whole must now be a &quot; gigantic force . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia at the night of Tuesday .
a few hours to move the government in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to avoid the tu@@ g routes through Romania , &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new bor@@ der@@ au@@ n .
the Romanian government den@@ ounced the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people that had cut fence through the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants are reported to report thousands of migrants to the Greek border .

the researchers present their analyses in the journal I@@ car@@ us .

at least at the south pole it must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
yet , the extent of the hidden underground world was not clari@@ fied .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to respect his sl@@ ender line will often not be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Mang@@ os contain quite a lot of sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them vitamin B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. In particular , Mang@@ os but much vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta @-@ carot@@ ene contains .
those who eat the fruits , thus supports vision , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when you buy , Mang@@ os shouldn &apos;t be too soft or have to be firm and pleas@@ antly sm@@ elled .

on Wednesday and night on Thursday the f@@ öhn stops , some with the ro@@ uting grid .
after the res@@ oun@@ ding on Thursday morning , a striking cold front , that brings forth strong rain , wind ch@@ ar@@ ches and a temperature curve .
like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest flow .
on the Alpine side , the night breaks down by the valleys in the night .
in the wake of the f@@ öhn until Thursday morning , the f@@ öhn stops in the p@@ amper@@ age with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , and partly occasionally in the Ur@@ ner@@ land also with over 100 km / h .

Rome is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday a well @-@ known square in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened at the name of the German Protest@@ ants on Wednesday .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the heart of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied to the work community of the Evangelical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live more than centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic manner the fact that their tradition of Christian faith may be welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ ine mon@@ k at the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city as a sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions will probably be encouraged by the histori@@ ans in his future fight against Rome .
in then with his theses , Luther was then dischar@@ ged in the ab@@ dic@@ ated Church with his theses .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus , with gold ( gold @-@ plated ) is one of the major works created by the Ot@@ mar &apos;@@ alto for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and bi@@ ble texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has formulated his personal interpretation of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 mot@@ i@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not far equivalent with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the particular topics , it may well have a quite dark effect .
around three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked for his bi@@ ble project , which he has taken a sub@@ jective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on issues such as cross @-@ sections , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he is thus trying to have fascin@@ ated several partner : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on the basis of painting with their respective passages .
he interpreted the Bible chair by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus transl@@ ates into current inter@@ connections . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror from Al@@ ts painting .
it is nestled between the original Bible collection of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who puts his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewelry cl@@ utch has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old makes double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately always trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who heard the strict Protestant mist@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing ever happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ work it , so perhaps to bear witness again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second purpose is to have more emphasis on the art in a rapid time : &quot; the perception of education is being min@@ ted today by the lame , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being rob@@ bed .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
images have always some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cause the viewer in the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bring it back and feel the strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for his face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ay gather on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; which was always &quot; a lover from Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like what he under@@ stands with his images . &quot;
I did not consider the Bible to complete the Bible , but those important for him , including mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text explains only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose from the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life to deep and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screens - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment for refugees to 2019 , that Bundesliga puts a significant sign on the weekend .
football is respon@@ ding to the adv@@ anta@@ geous situation in Germany and secu@@ res politics impos@@ es its help in the handling of the standing problems .
&quot; I think it &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in the principle that doesn &apos;t work me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interesting to gr@@ abs this topic in the gr@@ asp , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ boss Wolfgang Bur@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or and meet the State Minister &apos;s wife Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ la and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic is going to play a central role , &quot; he quit .
the football can help and wool .
the key course must however have to set politics .
the German soccer federation therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Kid@@ s@@ bach on the fr@@ inge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some states support this program .
this weekend , the 36 pro@@ filing tim@@ ers place a significant sign when you use the &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual short@@ age instead of the usual short@@ age of interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone can help , where and how they can only do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sporting director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and announced the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; granted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee &apos;s refugee is every day nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may be able to thank our strength , our influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have been so fu@@ eled to help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ en@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
on this Friday the international team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European team .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ ings had started their own projects in their places would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest Ver@@ tical are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will be presenting 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have called the entire sum for 2015 also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP executive chief gets lost in an accident
the Chief of Staff of Europe &apos;s largest Software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye several reports by falling from the beginning of July .
following the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell at midnight on a water glass that he carried on the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is nearly rec@@ alled and she was sm@@ itten down on the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Has@@ so Platt@@ ner c@@ ites &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t cannot pursue his work .
&quot; early October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is with the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , &quot; he will return to Germany in October and will continue to run the software licenses .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is typically comm@@ uted between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to have such personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen every way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to rise again if you like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ H without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : female power in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all the hopes on the com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally crushed in the first group match of the Europa League .
the player is also missing the football matches of the football Bundesliga in du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t go back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the Bv@@ C coach was open : &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its regular eleven position on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper .
for this reason Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place from regular art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; being trained on an absolute top level , &quot; he praised the World Champion .
but if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes into operation in all Europe @-@ League play , but Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open .
he will also contest the second game with high probability .
the research statement of Mit@@ er Re@@ us that the final entry for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League will have to be the goal of a mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for retro@@ active : &quot; that is not so wrong &quot; ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good opportunity to re@@ mot@@ ely access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rob@@ otic cars : government wants to play pre @-@ leadership for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be the change of the vehicle technological projection .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which amongst others fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
he spoke at the edge of the Frankfurt Motor Show on Wednesday in Frankfurt on Wednesday .
the automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and care for less st@@ ems , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the theme with his counter@@ part from the G7 countries , who also joined the industry with representatives of the industry .
the Strategic paper of the Ministry of Transport includes among others the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and a generous move on digital radio teleph@@ ony .
the testing of new technology is currently being established on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
with the drivers &quot; no additional detention risks , &quot; the Federal Government will check legal framework conditions and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments .
thus , Germany aims to use itself internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government also aims to dep@@ loy the Vienna Convention for a change in the Vienna convention so far the driver has to present itself as a driver .
when autom@@ ating driving , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that can capture the environment and process data in seconds .
based on a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on free@@ ways will be technically possible on motor@@ ways until 2020 .
yet little vehicles on public roads were &quot; expected to be expected just far by 2020 . &quot;
the value added value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the projected trial to about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the trucks can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic authority S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability for accident and security of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a result of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute in order to ensure that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars are going through in the next ten years , 32 percent count only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respondents say by 2025 for autonomous cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of digital banned Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire voyage on all roads .
on the highway , this could present 15 percent in flow @-@ flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo also lack@@ ed , and we are European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of very big fashion icon and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which makes it possible thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and so he raised men in the skirts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult in the past , meanwhile , it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From the side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed its first position to an exhibition on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , he was on the contrary , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had a chance of death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been in Montreal , Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of the man , which has written fashion history without ever completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built but it is a perfectly chore@@ ograph@@ ed grand art work for which much effort was used to stim@@ ulate the pupp@@ ets , for example a styl@@ ist was engaged .
14 tons of material have mo@@ red the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest@@ ation in October was still a special treat : a leather tro@@ users out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ t@@ er &apos;s old ted@@ dy appli@@ que can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , well @-@ known daily experim@@ entation of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
but did this later conf@@ use fashion in itself .
he did a fashion magazine and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later on I bought those things .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t pay the models .
they did not get , they were able to keep the sh@@ am@@ ots .
jewelry instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen &apos;s about , meters to make .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example to ceilings and curtains .
the only one today doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the run@@ down seats .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning of pl@@ au@@ ener tip mode , fashion has played a major role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt announces some examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
ever , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , which re@@ jects prior @-@ past stit@@ ches , is an increasing client potential .
if there is no niche in the textile industry in Germany , it is no longer available on the market .
they already make half of all orders .
fashion seats Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine further companies .
only they must carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private trade stores and wholesale there are almost no more .
our products reach the customer in this way hardly .
the mass housing nowadays may be much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost entirely driven by chains .
in addition , weaker are exports , currently being exported to Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score thanks to environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery shop in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have been introducing a quality seal that shows that we are ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; it also rel@@ ates to the materials used . &quot;
Vice President U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berg University of Zurich University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alis@@ es on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to oppos@@ e the competition from the Asian space , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this needs time and courage .
a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think primarily economically , says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design will often only be varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was revi@@ ve the historic snow peaks .
we embroi@@ dered the machine at some places small ch@@ icks .
the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith master@@ y of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ d said about it : &quot; in advance I couldn &apos;t start with traditional plann@@ ers . &quot;
now they use the nail tip for their jewelry .
in a elabor@@ ate procedure , they shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors wanted to have lived in pl@@ auen and the surrounding areas and who would like to have a mem@@ ento .
that I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ Film

however , according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it is not necessary to make a re @-@ filter , but in order to continue a kind , the 20 years after the first film plays with the magic ma@@ ids .
this is about the experiences of N@@ anny and the family Ban@@ ks in times of the Great Depression in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
the director is now firmly held : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently marked &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema .
XI urged to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must shut down wider out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping , a group commissioned by the Reform of the Reform .
&quot; China should encourage themselves to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business creation , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the main leadership group to deep@@ ening an extensive reform .

EU wants to double mercury limit in smokers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large smokers and consumers make a significantly higher dose of nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation Foo@@ d@@ watch , who is an appropriate employer of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and adverse events related to environmental and environmental policy are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from Foo@@ d@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to indicate the limit values of the thr@@ ills for big fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large quantities of prey , however , bur@@ dened as strongly with mercury , that on the basis of existing limit values , about 50 per cent of the catch may not be sold .
after double the limit values , only 14.5 percent would be un@@ compens@@ ated .
in return to Foo@@ d@@ watch , the EU wants to watch the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
Foo@@ d@@ watch uses this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller char@@ is@@ fish , such as car@@ p , mostly bur@@ dened as low as they already comply with the maximum limits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the decrease in cl@@ an@@ ism is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de angle maneu@@ ver that helps in the economy alone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a most po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which suff@@ ices about the food chain especially in space fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts , especially in un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explains the stated limit on its website , however , that it is not to be expected for health haz@@ ards of the general population . &quot;
mercury is mainly driven by coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ eb@@ u@@ ck@@ les ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of Germany being em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and widespread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel quoted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March out of paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past year , European war@@ nings of mercury in fish have already accounted for the most frequently reported health risks in the EU War@@ ning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
