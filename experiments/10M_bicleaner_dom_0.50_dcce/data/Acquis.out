the aim for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination should not be colored as artificial , at least as long as not until an international treaty is concluded about a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination are to distribute in such manner and in such quantities that it is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative cont@@ enti@@ ant blood cells .
the amount specified in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has over all production stages and controls of reag@@ ents to blood @-@ group determination .
adequate samples of all issued reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory process to keep up with some probability that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ent determination of the reag@@ ent determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to gain the effectiveness and preserve the stability of the re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es .
for technical reasons these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their effective treatment in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ent human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents can contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual tank a black @-@ printed label is printed in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . quantity or , with dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed ,
also this label or label on the box , in which the individual containers are located , or the containers should be included in the enclosed instructions : 1 . complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . quantity or , with dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed ,
each mission is to add a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood selected people of group B , which can be immune by red blood cells or by specific substances in group A .
anti @-@ A Serum can contain human red blood cells , which include A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2@@ B . it does not include any human red blood cells containing no A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum can be dissolved in parallel to the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group equivalent or an appropriate comparison par@@ ate against over@@ flowing from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the service must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object @-@ bearer with a equal amount of 5 to 10 percent over@@ flowing from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B @-@ blood cells , it is necessary if the same attempt is dissolved with the anti @-@ A blood@@ stream , or a standard prepared par@@ ate of the same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons in the group A , which can be immune by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous human red blood cells containing B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it acts no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is sol@@ dered in parallel to the back @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard equivalent of the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group or an appropriate comparison test against an over@@ flowing from B @-@ blood cells .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed upon an object @-@ bearer with a equal amount of a 5 to 10@@ percent over@@ flowing of B @-@ blood cells , it must occur if the same attempt is dissolved with the same anti @-@ b blood @-@ group or with a standard prepared par@@ ate of the same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum can be obtained from the blood of selected persons in group 0 which can be immune to the group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gene A and / or B , i.e. those of the group A including the sub@@ groups A@@ 1B and A@@ 2@@ B ; there are no human red blood cells which contain no ag@@ os@@ o@@ ct@@ gene A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it o@@ vers@@ y human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ it@@ ized in general by anti @-@ A serum of blood don@@ ors ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the back dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard equivalent of the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or an appropriate comparison test , separated against over@@ flowing from A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is again sol@@ dered to the back @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard equivalent of the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group or an appropriate comparison test against an over@@ flowing from B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the service must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
in addition , anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum is also a slightly readable Ag@@ itation of the blood @-@ body group A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed upon an object @-@ bearer with same quantities of 5 to 10@@ percent over@@ flowing from A1 and A2 blood cells , thus necessary , if the same tests have been dissolved with the same extent of the anti @-@ A blood@@ stream , or with a standard prepared par@@ cel of equal activity .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with a same amount of 5 to 10@@ percent over@@ flowing from B @-@ blood cells , it must occur if the same attempt is dissolved with the same procedure , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of anti @-@ b blood @-@ group or a standard prepared supplement of the same Avi@@ dity .
an anti @-@ A + A anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object @-@ bearer with the same amount of a 5- to 10@@ percent over@@ flowing from A@@ x ( A@@ y or AO ) blood cells , thus the ag@@ glut@@ amine occurs within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood @-@ group sera each speci@@ ality can belong to one of two species , which is to be distinguished by the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , among which a ag@@ o@@ cul@@ ation of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ination can only be reached in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle or using other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ert on object rests also hom@@ osexual red blood cells , which are spro@@ uted in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements to the effectiveness of ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly be changed when international standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D but not containing human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a t@@ er of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution .
an &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is simultaneously sol@@ dered in parallel to the in@@ complete , but un@@ diluted International standard equivalent of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) agent or a corresponding comparison to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all the red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum is to respond immediately after the possibility of blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are destined to use object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent over@@ flowing from C@@ c@@ De@@ e @-@ blood cells with approximately 40 ° C , and the Ag@@ itation must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , which are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells which contain the an@@ tigen C , but not containing human red blood cells , which do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
this ser@@ a is therefore only specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen , if the tested blood @-@ body in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution are in@@ hib@@ ited .
the tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on lenses in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have been mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ per cent of C@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e @-@ blood cells with approximately 40 ° C , and the Ag@@ itation must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) are supposed to have a t@@ er of at least 1 : 8 versus the C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on lenses in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed with a equal amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent over@@ flowing from C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e @-@ blood cells with approximately 40 ° C , and the Ag@@ itation must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be extracted directly from the blood immune @-@ conditioned people or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective under the specified reaction conditions at the same time .
if the serum is designed for use on object types , according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , will not be lower than with the ant@@ on@@ ary antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the group A .
anti @-@ A Serum can contain human red blood cells that include A @-@ an@@ tigen , that is called those of the blood groups A and AB , including the sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it does not include any human red blood cells containing no A an@@ tigen that is called the blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum can be dissolved in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard equivalent of the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or an appropriate comparison test , separated with elev@@ ating from A1 , A2 and A@@ 2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object @-@ bearer with a equal amount of 5 to 10 percent over@@ flowing from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A@@ 2@@ B @-@ blood cells , it must occur when the same attempt is performed with the recovered , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of the anti @-@ A blood@@ stream , or a standard prepared par@@ ate of the same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
anti @-@ B Serum can contain human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is called ones of the blood groups B and AB ; it acts no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ an@@ tigen , that is called by the blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is to be dissolved in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard equivalent of the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group or a corresponding comparison of blood cells of the group B to tit@@ re ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed upon an object @-@ bearer with a equal amount of a 5 to 10@@ percent over@@ flowing of B @-@ blood cells , it must occur when the same attempt is made with the recovered , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ atory of anti @-@ b blood @-@ group or with a standard prepared supplement of the same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ Human Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum to use in the blood @-@ group serum must include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against comple@@ mentary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immune to the injection of human serum .
