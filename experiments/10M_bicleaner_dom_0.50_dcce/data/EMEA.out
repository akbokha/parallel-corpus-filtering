it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . gen@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , mental illness , where patients man@@ tic episodes have altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe or severe episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients suffering from the medicine used in the past .
the injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased dis@@ ruption or behavi@@ oral distur@@ b@@ ance if the in@@ gest@@ ion of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used for inser@@ tion or the melting tablets in patients who prepar@@ es the hat@@ s of tablets trouble .
in patients who are using other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the receptors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters affects the receptors to activate .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine has a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and recovery is avoided .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the revival of the symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases caused by a placebo compared to placebo for a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ jam was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which could occur in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered in isolated un@@ rest that compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ ic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale of bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who were addressed to the treatment .
the company also resulted in studies in order to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to insert ( receive ) .
in both studies with injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased less@@ ness than those who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ oeu@@ vre than placebo .
in addition to a period of 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recovery of man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased more effectively than placebo which increased symptoms and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ li@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ ordin@@ ates ( un@@ controlled movement ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ine ( di@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness ) , vom@@ iting hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased memory production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , so@@ lic@@ t ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ) and anxiety .
the UN Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy during treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution for rapid control of increased dis@@ comfort and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ error , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission provided an author@@ ization to the European Union of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y has been shown for the treatment of severe and severe episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proved , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as a mono@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with view of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors . ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icides is part of psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders in some cases , after the beginning or after changing of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epidemic of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased su@@ icides in terms of anti@@ thesis by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , infectious disease ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ac disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that one year or less continued , there were occa@@ sional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l open Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie .
if patients were treated at an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y screening and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ fusion , the dose should reduce or reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns indicate or a clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ations of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be abolished including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was to be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ age in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states that are related to cr@@ amp@@ ages in connection with cau@@ tion .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were a higher risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dos@@ ing , a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for un@@ wanted rov@@ iti@@ c events in with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extreme and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ di or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ gens , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related undes@@ irable events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ gens treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
a weight gain in general in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to comp@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , observed in weight gain as a side effect , and could lead to severe comp@@ lications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system be careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers an ultra @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ans can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you consider the joint venture of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in consideration , the potential benefits should su@@ stain potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
after removal of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ age height before the beginning of the esc@@ ale therapy .
di@@ az@@ or@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ di@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated using a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentration .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ an@@ ism of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( de@@ meth@@ ad@@ meth@@ ad@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( de@@ pl@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if she &apos;s pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to in@@ adequate data security in humans and due to the in@@ adequate data on animals , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ on@@ zo@@ l had no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under Placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events specified below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ic , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie on , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was among those under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long@@ term study about 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ t@@ ine Therap@@ y .
man@@ ic episodes with bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients treated under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yielded no medi@@ cally important differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine mon@@ os@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of treated patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , in@@ undes@@ irable mus@@ cular events and increased mortality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or deliber@@ ate rep@@ lic@@ ants with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death .
there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . however , it is un@@ likely that h@@ ed@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma integration .
it is thought that the efficiency of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I error about the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 receptors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptors are medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7- , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ r@@ ye and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ cope dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ not , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study 52 % of the response of the response rates included a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions @-@ scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study about 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia demonstrated a significantly higher reduction in the recovery rates , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an ov@@ arian in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior to placebo for reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled Mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I error , with or without mental features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior performance of week 3 and an inform@@ ational effect comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic remission of Man@@ ia , such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I error , with or without mental function , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo controlled study about 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ent@@ eous humor .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the expansion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , which is cataly@@ st by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the median of the elimination time was nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with extensive met@@ abolic rol@@ lers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with almost 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , and in an pharmac@@ ok@@ ically investigation with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender dependent effects .
a pop @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Pharmac@@ ology .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and El@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study of subjects with different gra@@ dient of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and El@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull battles on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ li@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , clinical data could not recognize any particular dangers to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceed maximum dose or exposure to people , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects collected a dos@@ sh@@ ell@@ rin@@ a- pig@@ ment Acc@@ um@@ ulation ( AU@@ C ) in rats to 104 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10@@ 0,@@ 000@@ mg / kg / day ( corresponding in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ or@@ asis was determined by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkey from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ fold of the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie well below the limits ( 6 % ) of the concentrations in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times the mid Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

to prevention the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that one year or less continued , there were occa@@ sional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l open Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extreme and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ di or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ gens , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related undes@@ irable events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ gens treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study of healthy volunteers an ultra @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l around 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
di@@ az@@ or@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ di@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated using a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentration .
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficiency of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I error about the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 receptors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptors are medi@@ ated .
in an ov@@ arian in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; occurred among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
97 in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness against placebo .
in a relative bias study , in which the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form at healthy volunteers , the ratio was between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max -@@ mean value and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ or@@ asis was determined by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3@@ fold the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times the mid Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ ers in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or patients with various episodes of bi@@ polar I error , if an oral therapy is not attached .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically mounted , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tors should be completed and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
to minim@@ ize res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ izing the vari@@ ability , injec@@ tions in the M. Del@@ to@@ id or deep into the glut@@ ton @-@ maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under conversion of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or bac@@ on therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further development treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medicine by means of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y hot@@ tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution to insert .
there are no inquiries to the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavior that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I error .
in case of a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in relation to extreme conditions or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
research on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not intended for patients with alcohol or medication ( or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with cau@@ tion in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , infectious disease ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ac disease , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that one year or less continued , there were occa@@ sional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l open Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esie .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle growth , changing levels of awareness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and heart @-@ rhyth@@ ms ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
a weight gain in general in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie due to comp@@ or@@ bi@@ dity , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , observed in weight gain as a side effect and could lead to severe comp@@ lications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as a dispos@@ able in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ans the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is resulting in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ected inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
after removal of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ age height before the beginning of the esc@@ ale therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , was the intensity of the Sed@@ ation bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the adverse events specified below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) as possible for medical studies ( * ) :
in a placebo controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was among patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated with placebo patients treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yielded no medi@@ cally important differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients , compared to 2.0 % of treated patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , in@@ undes@@ irable mus@@ cular events and increased mortality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ our@@ ers compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ ism , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms in terms of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference poor .
the median mean improvement of the output value at the P@@ AN@@ SS skiing Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population , but statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled study 52 % of the response of the response rates included a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % .
current values from sc@@ andal that were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction in the response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an ov@@ arian in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study at schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less than 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I error , with or without mental function , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms in comparison to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a remission in relation to placebo during a stabil@@ isation phase in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ent@@ eous humor .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is within the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two formulation .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the average time to reach the maximum plasma cutting is 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target range in system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was administered in 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
studies on the reproduction application according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns according to the matern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bit ) on the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety sp@@ li@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ ist@@ ical potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular dangers to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that the maximum dose or exposure to people are clearly exceeded , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects collected a dos@@ sh@@ ell@@ ar @-@ pig@@ ment Acc@@ um@@ ulation and / or Par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ity ( AU@@ C ) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 @-@ fold in the middle state @-@ state @-@ state @-@ exposure / car@@ cin@@ oma ) with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( which is 10 times the mean state @-@ state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
in addition , an ec@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l sul@@ ates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle from monkeys after repeated oral gift of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mid @-@ state state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical recommended dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study , in which 460 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters would have been anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines ( given in combination with other drugs for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 of Abra@@ x@@ ane patients were treated to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing pharmac@@ euticals .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between medicines such as time until the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer resulted in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more efficient than conventional ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing pharmac@@ euticals .
in addition , it is not allowed to be applied to people who , or before the onset of the treatment , low neut@@ ro@@ res numbers in the blood have .
the Committee for Human Use C@@ ret@@ an ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not more in@@ efficient than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines and that in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines must not be given with other drugs to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and is not shown for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a heavy neut@@ ro@@ gan@@ y ( neutral number of &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y 3 , treatment to inter@@ rupt until a better level of 1 or 2 is reached , and at all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with adverse kidney function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a pi@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ form@@ ulate of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should immediately decrease and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient cannot again be treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ron number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ cy@@ tes rate has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( Bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a uniqu@@ ely cy@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity observed in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane are not unusual above all in patients with former anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or degra@@ ded cardi@@ ac disease or lung disease .
in case of the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ hea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ ics and con@@ sti@@ cking means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be employed in pregnant or with pregnant women who do not pract@@ ise an effective conception , except for the treatment of the mother with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in@@ corrup@@ tible .
women in the aged age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , use a reliable backup method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , while and up to six months after the treatment no child will bear witness .
male patients should be advised before the treatment about a sperm charge , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertil@@ ity .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects like fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can rely on the road resistance and the ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events carried out in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ ro@@ gan@@ y was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was rapidly reversible and dos@@ is@@ ans ; Leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 , the side effects are listed which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mono@@ therap@@ ist at each dose and indications in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .

o@@ rest@@ o@@ resc@@ ence 1 The frequency of the incidence of sensitivity is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , there are no estimates of actual frequency , and there was no correlation with these events .
P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ uli @-@ substance which promotes the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular indigenous and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing of its dep@@ end@@ isation .
this stabil@@ isation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic tissue functions .
it is well @-@ known that it con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma cells into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies have been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein ( en@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two inclusive studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated using Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 than a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
at inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had an ad@@ mitt@@ edly common condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ osis .
14 % of patients had no chemotherapy yet , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % for metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in contrast to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree of patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y on bas@@ eline on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmaceutical P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in total P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 minutes in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration towards multi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic ways .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ul@@ ary distribution and / or turn@@ outs of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced sound tum@@ ours , pharmac@@ ological properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane compared with a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent medium P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than according to a sol@@ vent ac@@ ac@@ ax@@ el injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of the fac@@ tual liver micro@@ some and tissue coated , it is reported that P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metabol@@ ised to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ abolic ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ abol@@ ite 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
more than patients aged over 75 years of age , however , only few data are available , since only 3 patients took part in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ic analysis .

in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which connection with a blood trans@@ fusion comp@@ lications may occur , if an eye @-@ bleeding is not possible before the procedure , and with which a loss of blood pressure from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the drug is indicated .
in patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ am is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his counsel@@ or , as long as they have received an appropriate manual .
patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency and patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron defic@@ ien@@ cies exists , and iron fail@@ ures should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel , or caused that the body is not adequate for the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .

Ab@@ and@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ein in the context of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems caused by the reference failure .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks after E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ am or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kl@@ ed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients were changed to the same degree as in those patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common adverse event of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ raine like heada@@ ches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ am may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems because other studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the drug has been provided for a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , pursuant to the regulations of the European Union .

controlled clinical studies have not demonstrated a significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration of an@@ es@@ oph@@ thal@@ mic and the avoiding of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically significant cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or storage con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure should not exceed 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .

in tumour @-@ treated patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ och@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic response should be taken into account ( patients who may be trans@@ figured ) .
if the h@@ b increase is larger than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be minim@@ ised in order to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ op@@ ia an@@ emia ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical therapies ) to keep the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk su@@ ction under the participation of the respective patients , which should take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for an individual elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , before the beginning of the epic @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ c procedure should have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ op@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ och@@ in al@@ fa for patients with an initial capacity of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mb@@ op@@ ic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled trials it was not proven for ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine that they could survive the overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of cancer .

the most common adverse effect during treatment with ep@@ och@@ ine al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ hable increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

there is an increased risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant , ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of sending a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( broken bones ) , including those who have suffered a s@@ lack of trau@@ matic hi@@ ring as they fall . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
additionally , patients with mor@@ ay Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) , or by injection in a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflamm@@ ation ) shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta , which can reduce the symptoms in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ similar symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for treating mor@@ ay Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over the age of 50 , which had recently undergone a fra@@ gment , the number of fra@@ c@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at for six months ( other bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood once again decreased or by at least 75 % compared with the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in people under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis cases ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis cases ) , the risk of hips was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequently in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or other parts of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of ren@@ al difficulties , reactions to the in@@ fusion place and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone fabric ) in a pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who are using Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis as the medicine used , as well as similar material for patients in which side effects of the medicine should be explained and referred to when they should turn to the doctor .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hill fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hill fra@@ cture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after operating provision of the hip fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the mor@@ ay Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta only was prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the mor@@ ay Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the mor@@ ay Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long reduction period of patients observed was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ass@@ ure patients with mor@@ ay Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly to at least 500 mg elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hill fra@@ cture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ts vitamin D was recommended in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , may be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with cancer in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended to use for the application in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are missing for the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient &apos;s population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ cem@@ ia is before the beginning of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid on bone structure , a temporary basis can develop with symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ cem@@ ia , whose maximum is usually occur within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ass@@ ure patients with mor@@ ay Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly to at least 500 mg elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene should be replaced prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental surgery with appropriate pre@@ ventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental gri@@ ps , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treated physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual profit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days of administration by Ac@@ la@@ sta may be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe adverse events reported to patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall incidence of pre @-@ hop@@ al wor@@ ries ranged from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occa@@ sional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable medicines are listed in table 1 .
kidney failure Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney failure , which itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cancer ) and in rare cases expressed as acute kidney failure , in conjunction with kidney failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the onset of kidney failure , as well as a limited kidney function , were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients , compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were treated below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mentary quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical trials after a hat@@ fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as re@@ dness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the Kiev area was bor@@ rowed , especially in cancer patients , over oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections , including oste@@ opath@@ itis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after dental implants or other dental components .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area at one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ cem@@ ia , it can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ia .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was found in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women at the age between 65 and 89 years ) with either two mild or moderate existing cycl@@ ine fra@@ cture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the scar@@ f -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ine fra@@ cture .
effects on morph@@ ometric cycl@@ ones Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly improved over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and over had a 60 % reduction in risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk for fra@@ c@@ tures over three years ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta raised the bone density at the Len@@ in@@ verteb@@ ra , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the Len@@ in@@ verteb@@ ral column by 6.7 % , the whole th@@ igh um 6.0 % , the cran@@ ks@@ ha@@ h@@ um 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology contains 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ ic patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es taken from the pel@@ vic tribe .
micro@@ computer symptoms ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients compared to placebo an increase of tra@@ bearing bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ( BS@@ AP ) , the N termin@@ ale prop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients with periodi@@ c intervals during the time period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced BS@@ AP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP has been reduced significantly by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the whole mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the acet@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D in total heat and sc@@ ans h@@ als for all points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta Treat@@ ment conducted over 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment to increase the BM@@ D around 5.4 % and 4.3 % at the cran@@ ks@@ haft .
clinical efficacy in men in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were randomised to 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the incidence of clinical trials was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study of men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is related to the percentage change of the l@@ umber verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D to 24 months compared to the output value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get from the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed mor@@ ay Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum ) of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold and 3.@@ 0@@ fold age specific upper normal level in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared with the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was detected in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
with the combined results , a similar decrease in the pain intensity and pain influ@@ encing was observed in comparison to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as a response phase at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach obtained with 141 of patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of patients with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , are maintained during a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ ir@@ respective .
after that , the plasma concentration rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
ras@@ cal bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic van@@ ishing from the big circulation system with half @-@ life times t ½ -@@ 0.@@ 24 and t 1 ½ -@@ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination of elimination with a terminal elimination round about ½ hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and the differentiation of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the requested dose were found in urine , while the rest is mostly bound to bone fabric .
the aggregate body Clear@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration increased by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no impact on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearing from by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme met@@ abolic systems is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patients ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , namely , 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in fact that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function of up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the c@@ ol@@ ie@@ tic acid .
as for heavy kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ solvency Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ working intraven@@ ous single dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C is the 6@@ times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks ( an cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ times the human therapeutic exposure ( corresponding to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Service Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained in detail as the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) which has been evaluated in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) , where Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic agent ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abe@@ tic medication ( dual therapy ) .
in addition , Met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) can be applied , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sulph@@ ur@@ ic resin or insulin , the previous dose of the Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ amide / insulin may be maintained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of the sulph@@ gly@@ col and the insulin delivery .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be enhanced by means of the blood sugar level , meaning type 2 diabetes is better adjustable .
in more than 1 400 patients efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur@@ ic resin ; in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo up to 3.5 years .
in studies , concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered at doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with Met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ur@@ ic resin in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased 0.@@ 94 % while the additional donation of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin had been examined at 289 patients , the patients who account for insulin had a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were long@@ suffering , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients who may respond to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ abe@@ tic converter ( high blood pressure - acidity level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment in patients as an alternative to the standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in patients , of which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission announced the take@@ over of Ac@@ tos Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing an account for placing an account in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also displayed for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate for which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility is un@@ suitable ( see section 4.4 ) .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients receiving at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should begin with the lowest available dose and increase the dose progres@@ sively .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
the patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and ec@@ de@@ me if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced ma@@ stur@@ geon disease was performed .
in this study showed an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver rating ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one must not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the limit of the normal range of the normal range , the liver values are thus possible to control the liver values as soon as possible .
if one patient developed symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explan@@ atory nausea , vom@@ iting , upper degra@@ dation , fatigue , app@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver rating values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should continue , should be led by the laboratory of the laboratory of clinical trials .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ mal weight gain has been proven that can stir in fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a Hä@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a slight reduction in the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed for similar trials involving Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is known as an oral two @-@ scale or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin delivery or as a two @-@ scale combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing mort@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ amide , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular o@@ e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear if there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular de@@ pl@@ es if patients should report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acuity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages of adverse events , randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years , treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in people compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter this entry , treatment ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for the investigation of the interaction have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ ot@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are metabol@@ ised by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ al@@ naked and HM@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ yn@@ mer are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ mus ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one around the 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and refra@@ ction of the lens as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic effects .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T calls for three times the upper limit of the standardi@@ zation region as often as under Placebo , but more rarely more than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ is .
in an out@@ come study in patients with the existing advanced sc@@ op@@ o@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of a serious cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency on Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one bz@@ an .
since the market launch has rarely been reported on con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
there was a summary analysis of messages of adverse events , randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one groups and more than 7.@@ 400 patients treated with associated medi@@ ation groups .
over a period of 3.5 years ongoing pro@@ active study , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a comparative study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to work on an activation @-@ specific nuclear receptors ( P@@ P@@ AR @-@ γ ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscles .
it was shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mono@@ therap@@ ist was continued over two years in order to examine the time up to follow the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be observed by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients below G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate in spite of three im@@ on@@ ated optim@@ isation phase with insulin exposure to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to achieve insulin ; a reduction of insulin @-@ dose associated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decline of the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in cre@@ dit@@ ations compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small study on 18 weeks of study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as a slightly improved LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced in comparison to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , Met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ matic gly@@ ceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to placebo , no statistically significant increase of L@@ DL @-@ Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel was found in the L@@ DL @-@ Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced values were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the sober tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial enhanced tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de mirror , this both via a effect on the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption , as well as on the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and existing advanced ma@@ stur@@ geon disease were random@@ ized to groups that received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after an oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one gets res@@ or@@ ly res@@ or@@ ly , with the leading concentrations of the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma generally takes 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ act studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one could not prove the relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ ot@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ us ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 - In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
following an oral application of radio@@ active ar@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the markers was mainly found in threads ( 55 % ) and at a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the median plasma @-@ elimination of plasma from un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans and the total active met@@ abolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but the inst@@ al@@ ments of the oral clearing of the mother@@ land is similar .
in mice , rats , dogs and Mon@@ keys in mice , rats , dogs and Mon@@ keys were repeated after repeated plant@@ ing , an@@ emia and reversible heart @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ es .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the fat growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by the rat den@@ cies of hyper@@ pl@@ Asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the bladder epi@@ thel@@ ium .
in a animal model of famili@@ al chocolate at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( F@@ AP ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ c@@ ots resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years , treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one women and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one who were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in people compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study on two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or lic@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a statistically significant decline of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in cre@@ w@@ ess showed a statistically significant decrease in the output values .
in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the sober tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial enhanced tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de mirror , this provides both a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption , as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to demonstrate their primary end@@ points , a combination of the whole mort@@ ality , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ ism , leg amp@@ utation on the Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ ening , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the in@@ gest@@ ion of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no risk of cardiovascular risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages of adverse events , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials were treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and received an increased incidence of broken bones in women .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice a day when a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as can no insulin can produce , and type 2 diabetes where the body is not able to use insulin effectively .
after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ spi@@ der , pointing out that the blood glucose levels were similarly strong as with another human @-@ insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to human @-@ insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in package directions ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane exceeded the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S into an author@@ ization for the placing of action by Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin delivery will normally be applied once or twice a day when a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection @-@ pin must be loaded under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar may have improved significantly , for example , due to a intensi@@ fied insulin resistance , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ haz@@ ards can be perc@@ ep@@ tible and should therefore be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ effective , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long @-@ acting insulin delivery ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA in animal origin ) can result in ensuring that a shift in the dosage is required .
if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is necessary in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients suffering hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal rights to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or less pronounced than in their previous insulin .
before travelling , passing over several periods of time , the patient should also be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor since such journeys can be used or taken meals at other times or taken .
the doctor must therefore consider the potential impact of treatment in therapy and to demand his patients after other drugs carried out by them .
4 . both hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , who can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ abe@@ tic medication , increase the risk of ab@@ normal@@ ities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic bodies can lead to consciousness and / or cr@@ amp@@ ages and end with temporary or permanent distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .
ill@@ nesses of the nervous system Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally - peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y The rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and usually reversible .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop in stages : • Lei@@ t mort@@ gage protein may be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have trau@@ mas pieces , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ resistant fruit juice with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) is treated by a proven help of glucose or glucose caused by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum capacity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of operation is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is justified in this fact that it is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of limits ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places in the human @-@ insulin molecule were dropped ; none of the Met@@ abol@@ ites formed by the split .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ li@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , to the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and to re@@ productive capability , the pre@@ clinical data can not recognize any particular dangers to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane bottle is taken from the fridge - the temperature of insulin is increased to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is pressed in the manual for the first use .
some patients suffering hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal rights to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms were less pronounced or less pronounced than in their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be applied to patients who may be superior to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id must be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S into an authorisation for placing orders from Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the whole European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the non @-@ working insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin @-@ insulin .
3 If the switch to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id is required in the patient a dose adjustment is necessary , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , passing over several periods of time , the patient should also be pointed out to bring the advice of his doctor since such journeys can be used or taken meals at other times or taken .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used for patients who have already been signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflamm@@ ation in the joints ) or poison @-@ no@@ des ( &quot; bricks &quot; ) , which can lead to joint vent@@ ures and bones .
if the ur@@ inary level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ im@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first months of treatment , the patient can still occur in tox@@ ins ; therefore , patients have to take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines for the prevention of gre@@ ed waste .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , because these groups were not examined for these groups .
in the first study included in the 1 0@@ 72 patients efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic fe@@ ats ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to placebo ( light medication ) and from Al@@ lo@@ qui@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ therapy ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ qui@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ qui@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose urine level was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 out of 262 ) of patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once received 120 m@@ g. daily in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under Placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( N@@ au@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart failure in the fore@@ stry , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the urine resp@@ ite in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pure in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ op@@ ia in diseases , which have already carried out to urine deposits ( including one from the case known as well as present gi@@ no@@ des and / or of tox@@ icity ) .
if the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid level ranges after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase in AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC can be considered 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restrictions the efficacy and safety of safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ solvency Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people have no experiences yet with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ u@@ per@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

cardiovascular disease in patients with academic heart disease or dec@@ imal con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ acid de@@ br@@ ine drugs , it may occur during the treatment of an acute g@@ iti@@ an accident , because due to the lowering of the ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ ac@@ id@@ ac@@ ity first di@@ ur@@ inary deposits may be mobi@@ lized in the tissues .

liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies have been observed light of the liver function values in the patients treated with February ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function within the start of the February of February ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was no exchange studies at Feb@@ ur@@ ate , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ tension and tox@@ ic@@ ism .
the primary work point was in any study of the proportion of patients with which the last three month determined the serum concentration of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl daily ( n = 10 ) .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pure in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act @-@ study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the serum concentration of 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pure in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction in the serum concentration of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the physician attendance in Week 2 and permanently maintained for the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pure in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ a@@ or@@ at@@ in@@ values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restrictions The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restrictions ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary host angle has been achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clinical significant differences in relation to the percentage of the serum concentration of the serum concentration of subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration over@@ concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ and F@@ act study ) had a serum concentration concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data presented in two years of the open extension study showed that a decrease in the serum concentration of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of tox@@ icity in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against anti @-@ de@@ formation ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ inal no@@ des in which 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearing disappearance of up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with February ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ qui@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long@@ time renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ per@@ at after administration is easier and multi@@ pler doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses ranging from 120 mg to 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3,2 μ@@ g / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical change was observed in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration concentration , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state power distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ pris@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma integration of February 14@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved above the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bone weak@@ ens ) are used in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before meal , beverages or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplement ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 may be used separately from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company recorded data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors had been treated with the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than for those who received exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also specified data that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus such as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ don@@ tic ( diarr@@ hea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cers , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cers , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( can@@ op@@ ul@@ ance ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( mus@@ cul@@ ed stomach ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( fried stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic sti@@ cking .
in patients with adult sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be applied to ill@@ nesses of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the whole of the European Union .
the capsule shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a button on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medication ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin D3 supplement ) for the day .
the following indications have to be considered precisely in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cut off the tablet or remove the tablet in the mouth as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place prior to the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . p@@ ept@@ ance Ul@@ kus , active g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal bleeding or surgical intervention in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , are only given specific care ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rare followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ em@@ ic strips , were reported in patients under the in@@ gest@@ ion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these severe and required a hospital order ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and the patients should be pointed out to susp@@ end pain or re @-@ inflamm@@ ation pain or new or to shar@@ pen@@ ed so@@ d@@ burn the drug ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ y side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or towards the occurrence of symptoms that indicate a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all doses have to be passed on to patients and to be understood from the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , there was no increased risk , rarely ( to market launch ) Mag@@ i and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and comp@@ lications reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ opath@@ ic ) , patients were reported to cancer patients whose therapy was mainly intraven@@ ously enough for Bis@@ phosph@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure to decrease the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ y of the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the treated doctor is decisive for the treatment of therapy in each patient on the basis of an individual profit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to have taken the tablet in the next morning at the failure of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
they do not take two tablets a day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the day of the week .
other diseases that may affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ o@@ deficiency ) should also be adequ@@ ately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to therapy .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral drugs can inter@@ fere with the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore the patient must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at for at least 30 minutes before using other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken together in clinical trials involving a variety of usually prescribed drugs without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable for pregnant women during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at allow no indication of the effects directly to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opath@@ y of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports originate from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum Cal@@ ci@@ ums decreased to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ates to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
an oral over@@ dose of an oral over@@ dose can be hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , p@@ oph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper part of the g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal tract , such as stomach cancer , So@@ d@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , Ga@@ str@@ itis or Ul@@ zer@@ a .

in severe cases , a deficiency may lead to phy@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ bate , hyp@@ oph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie and thus lead to an increased risk of ap@@ ron and bones with oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and fra@@ cture response at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the fra@@ cture @-@ venti@@ onal study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in Phase III studies the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % of the sp@@ ine , 5.9 % at the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als and 7.8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a 48 % reduction was reduced by 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who had suffered one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of sp@@ ine and dri@@ chan@@ ter continues to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ales and the entire body has been maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo@@ arding studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily donation of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rates by 47 % ( al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

the bending radius increased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bi@@ fi@@ in@@ ability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed according to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but spread rapidly into the bone and ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
analysis After intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was eliminated in 72 hours by the urine and no radio activity was found in the stit@@ utes .
after an intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance exceeded not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted in rats via the su@@ ction or bas@@ al transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that human medicines affects the ex@@ cre@@ ation of other medicines through these transport systems .

training In the gift of radio@@ active mark@@ edly vitamin D3 on healthy subjects was the mean expansion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours , 2.4 % , in the threads after 4 days 4.9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , who is not deposited in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the urine .
although no clinical data are available in this , however , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ as should also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function , an increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at must be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ ant@@ f is administered by adult patients , a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent dis@@ closure of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data published in the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation was presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ ant@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was cancelled after a treatment period of one year ( for example , as often a renewed transplan@@ t or recovery of the di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined how Adv@@ ant@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with persistent hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , Mak@@ ro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ po@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other components must not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) drugs are taken at the same time using Adv@@ ant@@ f , as the Adv@@ ant@@ f dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ otherapy treatment and treatment of transplan@@ tation , this medicines should be en@@ acted or made any changes in the immune reaction therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immune soup .
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain a corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the formulation or regime &apos;s control should be performed only under the tight control of a medical certificate ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us will remain .
the Adv@@ ant@@ ments of Adv@@ ant@@ f should be based on clinical assessment of dis@@ comfort and toler@@ ability in single case and blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; recommendations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f you should control the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level prior to the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching to switch .
on day 4 the system@@ ic exposure , measured as valley mirror , with both formulation and liver transplan@@ ted patients was comparable .
careful and repeated controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ant@@ f , to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate after@@ installation phase .
since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ant@@ f Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment is administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the application of application to supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ tation needs to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendation - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of the corne@@ al transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ment Therap@@ y should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be later necessary since the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabi@@ lization of the patient according to transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ment Therap@@ y should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dose recommendation - change@@ over to Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted to a daily dose of twice daily dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ f to a once daily consumption of Adv@@ ant@@ f , resulting in relation to the whole daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over of other immune broth to Adv@@ ant@@ f a day , treatment with each corne@@ al transplan@@ tation may begin each day for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ant@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0,15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning .
other gra@@ fts , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ a , pan@@ cre@@ as and transplan@@ ted patients , Pro@@ gra@@ f was administered in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ 10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ ased patients in an oral initial dose of 0,@@ mg / kg / day and for intest@@ inal gra@@ vit@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups in special patient groups with reduced liver function and prevention of blood cells in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function As kidney function exercises no influence on the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum concentration , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ant@@ f At the conversion of a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ n on a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see section 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the Tal@@ king in full blood . the dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of dis@@ comfort and toler@@ ability in single case involving full blood @-@ gro@@ ove @-@ Tal@@ esis inspec@@ tions .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood pressure level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ant@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes to immun@@ ti@@ zing therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that might change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f is a drug with a low clearing , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of the valley must not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ esis of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us lies in the whole blood in the first time according to liver transplan@@ ations , usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and ad@@ ren@@ al transplan@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
as a rule , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml was used during the subsequent edi@@ fication of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ts and other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain a corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the formulation or regime &apos;s control should be performed only under the tight control of a medical certificate ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 To treat adult patients suffering from transplan@@ tation , which proved to be contrary to other immune to@@ va as therapy for therapy , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ aneous formulation .
proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft reactions in adult suffer@@ ers and gra@@ fts in children are still not yet a clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ant@@ ment Adv@@ ant@@ f .
due to possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a down@@ turn of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the consumption of vegetable preparations contain the cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant enh@@ ancements during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentration in the blood is offered since the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was referred to as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y , aqu@@ eous humor or sept@@ um @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ es , which can be observed also among Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart defect , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid over@@ load and eyel@@ ids .
as in other immune to@@ va , the influence of solar light or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or using a high protection factor .
if patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for Pre@@ s like heada@@ ches , changes state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual distur@@ b@@ ance should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ elle , re@@ tar@@ ded , L@@ act@@ osis is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ t@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ lac@@ t@@ osis special attention .
simultaneous use of herbal medic@@ inal products or vegetable medic@@ inal products known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce blood levels by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or reduce blood levels .
it is recommended that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ b blood levels can change at the same time of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A @-@ metabolism and to adjust the T@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A @-@ metabolism and to adjust the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining equivalent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly distinctive interaction was done with an@@ tim@@ y@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ol as well as with the M@@ acro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the inhibit@@ ing of g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal tract , resulted in results .
highly @-@ controlled pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute dis@@ rep@@ tile reactions , can increase or decrease concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .

in the first year after the transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ - syndrome was also less frequently observed after the transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and has been reached after reaching the pl@@ ung@@ ed valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
intest@@ inal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ rit@@ ual and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or one by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing of the Clear@@ ance payments .
this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ abolic before the ex@@ cre@@ ator , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly made over the g@@ all .
in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at Adv@@ ant@@ f ( twice daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , the system@@ ic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than in Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .

Adv@@ ant@@ aneous bleeding is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a deficiency of factor VIII , inn@@ ed bleeding ) .
the dosage and frequency of application can be addressed to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII , which causes blood pressure problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
adv@@ ances is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , however , it is produced differently because the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was analysed with prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ances at the prevention of blood levels in 86 % of 510 new blood pressure were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances must not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ er or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to grant approval for the placing of Adv@@ ence in the entire European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy follow after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
the factor VIII activity in the respective period should not drop under the stated plasma concentration ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) in the respective period .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute damage has been eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) , until the risk of patients is over .
during treatment course it is required to the control of the recommended dose and frequency of injec@@ tions to a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma concentration .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , ranging in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of blood vessels with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma should not be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be weighed .
the transfer rate should be addressed to the patients , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days are the largest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extru@@ sions and an@@ am@@ ni@@ stic In@@ hibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product was observed on another , the re @-@ act of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
because of the rare rise of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and still life .
patients with the largest number of patients occurring in patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for education of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected drop of blood pressure factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred in post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
the blood circulation has been observed during the whole period and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed adequate values on the 15 . postoperative day .
clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy up to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , there was none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy up to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) according to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in the previously untreated patients of a current clinical trial 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a continued peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell@@ us , but there were no signs or symptoms that hin@@ dered to an allergic reaction or sensitivity .
in four patients , the outbreak of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ hel@@ pless gran@@ u@@ lo@@ tes was reported in several repeated product positions within the study .
7 . as with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E was reported concerning hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive actions from the allergic type , including aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII is active as a factor for the fourth factor , and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmaceutical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ art@@ ic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 listed below .

based on the available data available since the initial appro@@ vals , the CH@@ MP has continued to be beneficial as a positive value , but in consideration that the safety profile is closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the appro@@ vals for approval in 5 years is to apply for further extension .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially distributed the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company receives his application for a grant from Adv@@ ant@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
however , these are the breast , the brain , bone or female parts ( tissue , which links other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and reli@@ es ) .
it is a type of virus that was genetically modified in such a gene that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ oc@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so it has no copies of themselves , and therefore no infections can trigger people .
Adv@@ sp@@ ine would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of non @-@ defective in the human body , is usually formed to re@@ covering damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company consisted of data from a study involving a patient who stood at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the area of the basement , into the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers to the questions presented , some questions were still un@@ explained .
based on the testing of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP has created 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ ine is presented in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors for the patient .
the committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of medicines in the body , the type of administration and the security of medicines .
in addition , the company had not demonstrated that Adv@@ oc@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient .
the Company did not know that the CH@@ MP has not been aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ oc@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alter@@ ations of the tablets means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y car@@ ving , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len @-@ caused inflamm@@ ation of the nose @-@ det@@ achment ) in patients with hooks @-@ s@@ mu@@ g ( silent nose ) .
in adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose skin ( stored n@@ oses ) , are cl@@ amped .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medication can be repeated on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects of the main effects were the changes of the crit@@ eri@@ zing of the ha@@ y p@@ ush@@ es atoms that were reported from the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all the Gras@@ shop@@ per y@@ mpt@@ ome , the patients who had Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were reported on a decrease in symptoms of 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.9 % compared to patients who had p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in alone .
if only the swelling of the nose has been viewed , the patients showed a reduction in the symptoms of 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients treated by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ y@@ car@@ ts ( heart @-@ hunt ) , mal@@ ay@@ g@@ itis ( throat ) , an@@ gling , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( insom@@ nia ) , Som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( Sle@@ eps ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in or one of the other components , against ad@@ r@@ ents active substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug to the treatment of aller@@ gies ) , are not used .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( hyper@@ tension ) or hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by brain cancer ) or having a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted a approval to the Company SP Europe to take a grant from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is in the whole to swal@@ low ( i.e. without it to cr@@ ush@@ es , break or to di@@ gest ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after shooting of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as at long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in can take from time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper bre@@ aths , the treatment may be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in contains , the drug is also con@@ tra @-@ indicated with patients treated with a mono@@ xide ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ zers such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , Cab@@ er@@ gol@@ in , Er@@ go@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ in , Eph@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , oxide particles , ox@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient @-@ collective @-@ collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to address the appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver redund@@ ancy , and the data do not suff@@ ice to address the appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment with occurrence of hyper@@ tension or hyper@@ tension , cardi@@ ac disease , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symp@@ tom disorders ( such as heada@@ ches or a rein@@ forcement of heada@@ ches ) must be abolished .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ab@@ normal@@ ities • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • People with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ ch@@ bu@@ asmus in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise could prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their extent .
however , in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , ery@@ thro@@ po@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ edel@@ ic tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the treated patients treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in had been taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ ited in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate or an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ conc@@ ession of the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities as compared to the normal population .
since recovery studies are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ oral properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied however that in very rare cases , it can occur in very rare cases which can lead to a distur@@ ban@@ ability of road resistance or ability to serve machines .
symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S Depression ( Se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ish spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , heart @-@ circulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S @-@ stimulation is especially most likely in children , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ age , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , hood , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the tox@@ icity of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human ma@@ st@@ cells / b@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as the expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flight volume , including the gain sub@@ jective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of strokes compared to placebo was determined .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in at the recommended dosage can cause more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seas@@ on@@ ical r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine path@@ o@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al @-@ s@@ mu@@ g ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al @-@ s@@ lei@@ c skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is detec@@ table within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy volunteers over 14 days the flowing weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in was reached on day 10 .
in the context of an pharmac@@ ok@@ ul@@ atory study , which was conducted with formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was found that four volunteers Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in po@@ or@@ ly recycled .
the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , was a exposure according to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ li@@ ology , the tox@@ icity in repeated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reag@@ ents , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot recognize any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally contained in the context with the content of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in .
in re@@ productive studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ae was in the oral gift to rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ lia .

for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal @-@ cat@@ al@@ r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies were submitted to demonstrate that the body takes the sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children are un@@ think@@ able .
at allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us showed an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms followed after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to placebo and 33 % treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe , an author@@ ization for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet is once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see section 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated in accordance with the previous disease and may end after the result of the symptoms and their re@@ acts are resumed .
during per@@ si@@ sting allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) it can be recommended for the patient during the allergy term .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ po@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not intensi@@ fied at the same time taking alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied however that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to impair@@ ment or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ c@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were reported more often than in placebo were ti@@ re@@ dness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ ches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young people aged 12 to 17 , the most common adverse effect of heada@@ ches occurred at 5.9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , administered by up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the charging of pro@@ inflamm@@ atory cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human ma@@ st@@ cells / b@@ op@@ hil@@ a as well as the expression of the expression of the adhes@@ ion P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study with multiple outlets , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ac effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth @-@ time clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in has no effect on standard measurement variables , including the gain sub@@ jective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks that are connected to the fly .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the lens of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion , and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Tr@@ än@@ en@@ sion and Roman &apos;s eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ onally , per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent Rhin@@ itis in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as an occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent Rhin@@ itis will be defined as an occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the total energy efficiency of the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investigated as representative for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology explo@@ res in different forms of forms and chronic patients can be randomised and spec@@ tively .
as the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all the human ill@@ nesses , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is also evident in other forms of form@@ at@@ aria for improvement of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ c@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies of anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti @-@ hist@@ amine disease were excluded from the study .
improvement of Juda@@ ism by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and juni@@ per , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate the variables .
in an Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients were comparable to patients with the general seas@@ on@@ allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , 4 % of the patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no points for clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible , however , has not yet been identified , causing inter@@ actions with other drugs to be excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ ited in @-@ vi@@ vo no C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate or an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty acids , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of tox@@ icity in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ li@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the Re@@ productive response , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in cannot recognize any special dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent Rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the con@@ gru@@ elling doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections , or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin trials .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher subsi@@ st@@ ence load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years , is identical with met@@ abolic , is identical to the children who is normally metabol@@ ised .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in addition to which ery@@ thro@@ po@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not intensi@@ fied at the same time taking alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ c@@ aria , patients received 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , receiving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age who came for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy in question received a daily disaster dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
due to the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ c@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated for children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multi@@ ples of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ninth @-@ time clinical dose ) applied for 10 days when adults was applied , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in clinical studies at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of strokes compared to placebo was determined .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets carried out tablets with adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of the psych@@ ot@@ ori@@ asis .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither due to the simultaneous consumption of alcohol neither to a gain of alcohol @-@ induced activity or an increase in the ris@@ ings .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with aller@@ g@@ inal r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the lens of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , Tr@@ än@@ en@@ sion and Roman &apos;s eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ c@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the prevalence of this restri@@ ctive phen@@ ot@@ ype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ers ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ an multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , ob@@ stru@@ cted by met@@ abolic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no points for clinical @-@ relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible , however , has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .

Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) in June 2008 that the company receives his application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influenza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influenza virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which may cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause an future pan@@ de@@ mic to protect .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new strain of the influenza virus , which can easily spread from man to humans because people don &apos;t have imm@@ unity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
according to administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and it forms antibodies against it .
therefore , the immune system is able to form a fast antibody in contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus .
subsequently , the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ alien ) , are cleaned and are used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; Good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the security of the vaccine is not to be fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA region in the EMEA vaccine .
if you need to take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you wish more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which causes the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase stands as a solution for inclusion , but these cannot be taken along with k@@ nights as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gen@@ ase should first be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs taken before the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus may appeal to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral drugs twice daily .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gen@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs to the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure diseases , but may have the damage to the immune system , and thus avoiding the development of HIV infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously did not have been treated with prot@@ ease .
the A@@ gen@@ ine reinforced drug A@@ gen@@ ase has been compared with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with detec@@ table concentrations of HIV in the blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of the viral load after the treatment .
in studies with patients who previously did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks of A@@ gen@@ ase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml of placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase has also reduced the vir@@ us@@ load , but of the children who previously treated with the prot@@ ease , only very few were addressed to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease , the drug A@@ gen@@ ase increased the vir@@ us@@ last according to 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase with k@@ eg@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks than in patients who had previously managed their previous prot@@ ease :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) heada@@ ches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , N@@ au@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who are cur@@ rant ( a vegetable supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are equally dismant@@ led as A@@ gen@@ ase and are beneficial in high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines referred to HIV , patients who possess A@@ gen@@ ase ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( onset of bone fabric ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection that caused the recovery immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat the HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
in general , A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ amp Rit@@ c@@ avi@@ r , but the committee determined that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ri@@ k@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
A@@ gen@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information templates .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited , an author@@ ization to the placing of A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years old .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ise Boo@@ y of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , together with low doses of k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inclusion is 14 % less than from Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice a day , combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs twice a day .
2 . if A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased amount of k@@ nights ( Boo@@ y ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20@@ mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ nights or other prot@@ ease were not examined in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ euticals data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or moderate liver abuse with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function disorder it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r during the in@@ gest@@ ion of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other comp@@ lications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be applied together with low doses of k@@ nights and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with the existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction among anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and k@@ eg@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ os@@ c@@ ason or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ co@@ ids , which can be exchanged via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ bility effects including mor@@ ay C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the epi@@ thel@@ ial function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the absorption of the HM@@ G Co@@ a tube @-@ reduc@@ er Hem@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of a@@ gen@@ res and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ ic@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drug , which may cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ot@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods used to determine the drug concentration .
in patients receiving these medicines at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of lower plasma concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the ability of metabol@@ isation inter@@ actions with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tives can be changed , however the information is not enough to appreciate the kind of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored in op@@ ium @-@ related symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of k@@ nights .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity in the A@@ gen@@ ase solution of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is con@@ tra @-@ coated with children under an age of four years and should be applied with cau@@ tion in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set on a duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported via the onset of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia in combination with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated with associated met@@ abolic disorders .
in h@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ ation patients ( Type A and B ) that were treated with the prot@@ ease of infection , there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ op@@ ans and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral response ( ART ) is able to develop an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ ist infections which leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol protein index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given at the same time using medication which represent a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ res must not be given along with medicines , whose active ingredients are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma and / or life threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical reas@@ oning and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the low plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often observed adverse effects on the liver .
cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r can be ab@@ ated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with cur@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes part in the Order of Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r@@ ens and , if possible , to check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ d below ) .
508 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily , confir@@ ming efficacy and safety of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % decreases if Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ rus .
a dos@@ ing preparation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a tight monitoring due to the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ession of this combination .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene , but is advised due to a touch of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenues from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see instructions below ) .
therefore , at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ es@@ eed in the serum concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r may be used .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , it is recommended that Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced and potentially harmful plasma concentration .
when these medicines are applied together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitor should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be applied .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ az@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of at 193 % , making side effects associated with pul@@ p .
if it is required for clinical reasons , at least one of the recommended dose should be at least half of the recommended dose , if no clinical data is at least half of the recommended dose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma concentration of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day led to 2,@@ 69@@ times a day compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without the simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r with k@@ avi@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , among them sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied jointly with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly at inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be restricted to toxic reactions , associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease , it is advis@@ able that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ b@@ ance .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ volcanic con@@ va , known as an en@@ rol@@ lers ( phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lower plasma level of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ cular pin , di@@ visible pin , Nic@@ odi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ ck@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , which may possibly increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these medicines .
the simultaneous consumption of A@@ gen@@ ase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , long@@ suffering and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day , along with 50 µg of fluor@@ om@@ p@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous C@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gen@@ ase with k@@ eg@@ avi@@ r is not recommended to cope with this Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of a treatment system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ bility affects the effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at HM@@ G @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and are expected to expect plasma concentration at an event@@ ual administration of A@@ gen@@ ase .
as plasma cuts of these HM@@ G Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines is not recommended .
there is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ isation of mirrors , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by the same gift of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with oral mal@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time use of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am cau@@ tion .
data for simultaneously use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors on a possible increase in plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored in op@@ ium @-@ related symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of k@@ nights .
because of its low reliability of historical verses , no recommendation can be given as the Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to be given if Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the same time gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ tic anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions together with A@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is advised due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ nights on hormon@@ al contra@@ c@@ tiv@@ a is not predict@@ able , therefore also alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medication may only be applied to the possible risks for the fet@@ us in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of activated rats Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is over to people in breast milk .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats that was administered by the mon@@ ot@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the still life Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight at the post@@ age .
the further development of a desc@@ endant , including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ productive capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the un@@ think@@ able of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of these side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , coming early , and placed rarely for treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if it is used in connection with the in@@ gest@@ ion of A@@ gen@@ ase or another at the same time as to the HIV treatment of used drugs , or whether they are a consequence of the ro@@ under disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned adverse events are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1,200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) performed by the investig@@ ator as in connection with study medication , were listed and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as the treatment of laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with an distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) of HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ ctive tissue tissue , multiplied intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ es of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( stit@@ ches ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral substances that were treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull@@ do@@ zers ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 NR@@ TI@@ - previously treated patients under Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin rash was usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ id nature , with or without che@@ eses and occurred normally during the second treatment week and disappeared within two weeks , without having to cancel the treatment with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral response ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflamm@@ atory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ ist infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice a day and were observed twice daily ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory modifications ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory modifications ( grade 3 and 4 ) , who received cases with low dose of tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de and CP@@ K values , who received A@@ gen@@ ase with low do@@ si@@ ph@@ on@@ avi@@ r patients .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is restricted to signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both an acute and chronic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peripheral blood parts .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ing concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the relation between the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication during human being is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been used , as with other k@@ nights or clinical treatment methods - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
in sixteen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical examined .
a gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients were treated with prot@@ ease of patients who were treated with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical resistance tests , Gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ orph@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phenom@@ enal resistance to F@@ os@@ am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r with reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutation or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to take care of the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ er@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic resistance analyses , phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be applied in conjunction with gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical data to estimate the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ orph@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or .
firms that distribute diagnostic tests , clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of resistance tests .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity against Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r however still remains in general .
there are currently data available to cross @-@ resistant resistance between Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease holders for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ orph@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ c@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ c@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ c@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r de@@ fies its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , Isol@@ ate in ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isol@@ ates .
early demolition of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can act on the subsequent treatment course .
the receipt of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ c@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized adult ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ sid@@ ental ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest s@@ nor@@ k@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with untreated virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis provided the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group in case of the SO@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma under 16 weeks in plasma , with an non @-@ refra@@ ctive shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of the efficacy of in@@ gen@@ oo@@ ster@@ ly A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution was administered three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of k@@ avi@@ rus gave at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI was at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is associated with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benefit in the therapy to be anticipated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .

administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) has remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake does not affect the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and lets it close to a large distribution volume as well as un@@ loaded penetration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the substance in plasma , with the amount of unlimited Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of unlimited Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains maintained , the percentage of free active parts during the dos@@ ages of the tube in the Ste@@ ady State is about the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that represent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ its or in@@ hib@@ its or sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with cau@@ tion when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ ard base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the impact of a kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ atics lead to Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r plasma screens , comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for the can@@ opy with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ evol@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas with doses of the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and Kar@@ zin@@ ome has not been clari@@ fied and the relevance of this observ@@ able effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings were obtained from the present exposure data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ c and in @-@ vitro fertil@@ isation tests , the bacterial mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma test , micro @-@ core test in rats and chromosome deriv@@ ation on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , clinical studies have not observed any significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase , after the end of the treatment .
studies have been treated with tox@@ icity at juven@@ ate , treated with an age of 4 days , both showed an high mortality rates when treated with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r treated animals .
in a systematic plasma exposure that was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ ot@@ ong@@ ation and slight skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the increased amount of k@@ nights ( Boo@@ y ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20@@ mg of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use of patients with weak or light liver abuse with cau@@ tion , in patients with severe liver function disorder it is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drug , the serious or life threatening side effects can cause such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ot@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods used to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gen@@ ase should be set on a length of 27 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical reas@@ oning and lead to resistance development .
508 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ rus .
a dos@@ ing preparation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a tight monitoring due to the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ession of this combination .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ z in combination with Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins would be low .
when these medicines are applied together , be careful ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitor should be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to be applied .
if it is required for clinical reasons , at least half of the recommended dose may be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data in this case .

in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day , along with 50 µg of fluor@@ om@@ p@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous C@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
at the same time gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ tic anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions together with A@@ gen@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is advised due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous order of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ in@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r by 22 % , respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the possible risks for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats that was administered by the mon@@ ot@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the still life Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during feeding .
the un@@ think@@ able of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose the patient is restricted to signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures are required .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both an acute and chronic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood ra@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ing concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r de@@ fies its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , Isol@@ ate in ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the therapy optim@@ isation should be considered to be evaluated using PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of unlimited Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r remains maintained , the percentage of free active parts within the met@@ ering concentration in the Ste@@ ady State is within the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that represent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ its or in@@ hib@@ its or sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be given with cau@@ tion when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

in addition , there should be no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase solution to insert and low dose of do@@ si@@ ph@@ on@@ avi@@ r , that combination with these patient groups can be avoided .
even though a dose adap@@ tion for Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is not necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ eric Solution is con@@ tra @-@ Indi@@ cated by patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk content of a toxic response as a result of the high propylene gly@@ cem@@ ic content is A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion in small children and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .

in cases where such reactions had occurred at the output of ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the water caused by an emergency relief and a treatment of the affected area required .
there has been no clinical experiences for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine . directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions in the genital and periodi@@ c area , there have been no clinical experiences yet .
limited data relate to an increased rate of fish reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to eradi@@ cation of the cow@@ or@@ tions .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or hair attachment has not been investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions are in general during the therapy , or reactions are formed after the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made for several days .
the clinical results of therapy can be assessed after the treatment of treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since currently there is no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , in super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , other suitable treatment forms should be moved .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are not clinical experiences , therefore the application of tum@@ ours are not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in great tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is less lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ons on eyel@@ ids , inside of the nose or ears or on the lip field within the lip .
there are only limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants to an@@ atomic spots outside the fac@@ ial and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis to the poor and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take in the course of the therapy , or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions may cause big dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be exposed for several days .
in the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 anti@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine can be applied with cau@@ tion in patients receiving an immun@@ om@@ less treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not go directly or indirect adverse effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / f@@ lar@@ gen@@ al development , the development or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
even though neither after one @-@ Mali@@ an application , quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given to the use during feeding time .
the most common divided and probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the site of treatment of fish dishes ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients ) .
the most frequently reported and probably possibly related to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related to adverse events include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the B@@ 185 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study reported adverse events were shown below .
the most common one , probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in relation to the adverse events were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients ) .
the effects carried out by 252 in placebo controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this review of the clinical signs that occurred in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine often occurred to local skin reactions ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion / sli@@ pping / sli@@ pping / sli@@ pping / sli@@ pping ( 14 % ) and econom@@ ist ( 14 % ) .
according to the evaluation of the clinical signs , this study shows that there are five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream very frequently to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and heavy dro@@ pping and c@@ aller ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies for the investigation of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ z@@ ie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental record of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious adverse effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
according to the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine increasing system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected after the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al studies , 3 efficacy studies were shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete failure of the cow@@ or@@ tions during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment has been superior to a placebo @-@ treatment for over 16 weeks .
in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients treated patients who were treated with placebo in 20 % of the patients treated with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI :
a complete separation could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five @-@ time application per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that around 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % &#91; 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine played three times weekly in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discreet , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ op@@ ic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ac@@ les@@ ions within a related 25 cm2 large treatment area than on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or in face .
the year @-@ season data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of exterior , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not examined and therefore were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Con@@ tag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these trials ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three @-@ week weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest pharmaceutical concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in applying in a vision ( 12.5 mg , 1 l@@ ent bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended re@@ tention of the medicine in the skin .
the data for systematic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low in patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ icide bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study to paint the tox@@ icity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG had a significantly lower body weight and increased mit@@ z weight ; a tested study for four months resulted in the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity at mice had no tum@@ ors on the application for three days per week .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low system@@ ic absorption from human skin and has not mut@@ agen is a risk to see people based on system@@ ic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice that were treated with the acting @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat no neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to brain or ner@@ ves in connection ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ ca@@ amin@@ og@@ l@@ yp@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not min@@ ed and thus damage in most organs in the body and damage this .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of MP@@ S I can occur : magni@@ fied liver , rigid joints , the movements are more difficult , reduced lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with al@@ thirsty hy@@ me should be monitored by a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ re@@ ments , and the patients require relevant medicines under the circumstances in order to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( as regards its effect in terms of reduction in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me li@@ vened the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the children treated by the end of the study showed a normal large liver .
the most common side effects of Al@@ thirsty az@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , rash , ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ y ( arti@@ cul@@ ars ) , pain@@ s , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place .
very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ oters .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used strongly in patients who may react strongly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other ingredients ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be applied .
according to the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) every year , every year , all new information that may be known and possibly update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who receive al@@ um@@ az@@ y@@ me as regards the response to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission provided an author@@ ization to the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.@@ V. an author@@ ization to the placing on the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the whole European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ alog@@ y cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative Therap@@ y therapy for patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ des I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ thirsty hy@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ thirsty hy@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients with al@@ dur@@ st patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions , which are defined as any adverse events which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored continuously , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made in a reasonable clinical environment , in which re@@ vit@@ alizing conditions for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect nearly all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment start .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with cau@@ tion of alkal@@ az@@ y@@ me with cau@@ tion ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since little experience in terms of recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , risk provision@@ ing must be careful re@@ treated according to the theore@@ tically increased risk @-@ reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ rot@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in the case of a light or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wo@@ dden and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on the half of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are lowered , a treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering .
in@@ fusion can be re@@ started with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / iris and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me shouldn &apos;t be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experiments do not allow for direct or indirect harmful impact on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns , exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , it is recommended to satisfy while the treatment with al@@ thirsty az@@ me is not to satisfy .
the adverse events in clinical trials were prescribed predominantly in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
undes@@ irable medicines in connection with al@@ thirsty hy@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and the extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years , are very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs , severe reactions came out , including bronze , respiratory failure and fac@@ ial expressions ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , have been reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ j@@ ol@@ ation , with patients aged under 5 years old and patients with a severe con@@ current form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to an early retirement from the study ) were found no antibodies in 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ repar@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say , among them 3 patients who have never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ia .
patients with a failure to a low @-@ antibody mirror showed a robust reduction in the urine mirror in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was a variable reduction of g@@ ag to be found in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study ) showed an mar@@ gin@@ ally up to low @-@ neutral effect on the en@@ ig@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to imp@@ ose clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies could not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reaction , even if the occurrence of un@@ wanted pharmac@@ ies typically fell in combination with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and the preventing of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is removed quickly from circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely on man @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate receptors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ized in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients were random@@ ized by the average phen@@ ot@@ ype and only one patient had the severe phen@@ ot@@ ype .
patients were recruited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week ( 182 weeks ) every week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ st patients had an improvement of lung function and the ability to take on the table in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ st group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased steadily over to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atomic result of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size .
during the first 4 weeks there was a clear blow of the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease among patients treated by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes in the six @-@ minute approach , movement of the shoulder @-@ gel@@ ding Ah@@ i and visual acuity , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe comp@@ ut@@ form ) .
for four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg over the last 26 weeks due to elevated G@@ AG@@ - mirrors in the Har@@ n in Week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been determined according to the Z Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium @-@ run form showed a normal spiritual development rate , whereas in the older patients with heavier exp@@ ir@@ ation form or no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , examinations were carried out in a phase @-@ dynamic effects of various alkal@@ inity met@@ ering schem@@ ata on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly In@@ fu@@ sions , a justi@@ fiable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two met@@ ering schem@@ atics is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine is updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those with older and less affected patients .
based on the conventional studies of security don@@ ology , tox@@ icity in unique gifts , tox@@ icity in repeated gift and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can not recognize any particular dangers to humans .
since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other drugs , except with those listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the th@@ inner under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
5 ml of concentrate on the production of a solution in water bottle ( type I @-@ glass ) with plug ( silicone ble@@ but@@ yl rubber ) and se@@ al@@ ant ( aluminium ) with t@@ earing cap ( polypropylene ) .
10 preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e according to the body weight of the individual patients first determine the number of di@@ lute waste bottles .
the holder of the approval for the placing will be concluded within the given time the following study program , whose results form the basis for annual evaluation report to the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this regi@@ sters will be treated longer @-@ term security and efficacy information to patients who were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data for the natural pro@@ pon@@ ence of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients receiving under MP@@ S I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which has certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cer@@ am@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) ob@@ sol@@ ete , either in small amount of or that enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( superior ) compared to one of the ingredients of Al@@ thirsty az@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion reaction is any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion case ( see section 4 &quot; which side effects are possible . &quot;
if you use Al@@ thirsty az@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you have pharmac@@ euticals , chlor@@ o@@ quin or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because a potential risk of a diminished effect of al@@ thirsty hy@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines or taken recently , including non @-@ prescri@@ ption drugs .
hin@@ ts for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be diluted in front of the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it all 15 minutes gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs , severe reactions came up , including bronze , breathing and face .
very frequent ( appearance at more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdom@@ inal pain • rash , pain pain , pain pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ase , pain , pain and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • fewer oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion place
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information which will be available every year , and if necessary , the package will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is not stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the th@@ inner under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e according to the body weight of the individual patients first determine the number of di@@ lute plastic bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different drug against cancer ) , which is still not re@@ se@@ eable at the other parts of the body . ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread out to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic breast cancer that affects not the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who previously did not have been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously already received other chemical therapies , as well as some therapy .
to reduce adverse effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( a vitamin ) and get injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be given prior to or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in , in addition to an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tical &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ gel ) .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes , or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postponed or reduced the dose .
the active form of ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed allow@@ er the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells to divide .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is lighter von@@ out@@ fit than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer activity in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ single lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy alone compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , namely both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in survived an average of 12,@@ 1 months compared with 9.3 month at the sole administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients receiving chemotherapy first , the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el compared to 7.9 months .
in both studies , however , patients with which cancer does not attack the squ@@ epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for a longer period of survival compared to a comparable medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. an author@@ ization for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle bottle has to be filled with 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the equivalent volume of the necessary do@@ es@@ sis is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ clear bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ spor@@ tier bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( CO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ single Bronze car@@ cin@@ oma after previous treatment , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions one day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof , at least 5 cans of folic acid must be taken and the in@@ gest@@ ion must be continued during the whole duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also need to receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose , and after every third control cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ r@@ xed , a complete blood of blood was created before each gift - including a differentiation of the Leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ n census .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose test must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , taking place under the evaluation of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indicators in tables 1 , 2 and 3 for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ des C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
if patients are non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted if in patients after 2 dose induc@@ t@@ ances a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued at level 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above , compared to patients at age 65 years an increased secondary school has been increased .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended to use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical studies in patients with a cancer immun@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose adap@@ tions is necessary to go out for all patients recommended dose adap@@ tations .
the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not enough ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; to the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in ab@@ u@@ ity of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not included in the studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of the bone mar@@ gins , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ron number reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - Cy@@ cles once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ res , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ds and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity such as Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ ro@@ gan@@ y and infection with Deg@@ re@@ g 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ gan@@ y , observed , if a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ treated patients , folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ y@@ - lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ ster@@ oid drugs ( NS@@ A@@ ID@@ s ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ izing ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are provided for therapy with ps@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof , the intake of NS@@ A@@ ID@@ s must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid , collection in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ ected in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be weighed .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ous events were reported in clinical trials with ps@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life density ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible sk@@ ir@@ cular to re@@ productive medicine , men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted on advice regarding the handling .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid drugs ( NS@@ A@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ separation with a result of increased adverse events .
therefore , be careful when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of NS@@ A@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ei@@ c acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ isation , 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the Inter@@ shareholders with NS@@ A@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of interest status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ last@@ ic chemotherapy , requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions .
there are no data to use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites are expected in pregnancy in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful subsi@@ st@@ ition of the use@@ ment for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ proof , men should be pointed before the treatment starts to obtain advice regarding the handling of the lock .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients treated in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole car@@ dinal @-@ tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms reduction was characterised by improving the lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / c@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time of control .
a multi@@ center , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was diagnosed with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and from 7,9 months in patients with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

it is used for overweight adults with a body massage ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in connection with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ al @-@ induced diet .
patients who have been all@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can not disman@@ tle some fats in the food , thus about a quarter of the fats that suffer from food to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study in 3@@ 91 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 was compared to placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients treated with an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the After , Fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ b , chair , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair ( drums ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organs in transplan@@ tation ) or drugs like War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
furthermore , it may not be applied to patients who are absorbed in a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tive syndrome ( where sufficient nutrients are taken from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to chol@@ y ( one liver disease ) , and with pregnant or breast@@ feeding hat@@ s .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for placing on the placing on Or@@ li@@ stat GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body @-@ measure BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ tical , fet@@ al @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i cannot be applied to children and adolescents under the age of 18 because there are not enough data available for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ li@@ stat is only minimal , it is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adap@@ ting the dosage .
• Over@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients ( see section 4.5 ) • chronic mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tive syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • persistent treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of getting g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat individual meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is controlled with an improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dose of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic effects must be adjusted .
patients who possess all@@ i as well as medicines at hyper@@ tension or higher cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adapted .
it is recommended to prevent additional varied measures to prevent any inter@@ ruption of contra@@ ctions in the event of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study at the drug inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ li@@ stat and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration was observed .
applying War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients receiving clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ li@@ stat , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be recommended to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of one l@@ ump dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Or@@ li@@ stat , a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication , as the absorption of single fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal side effects were obtained from clinical trials involving or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and generally accepted slightly and temporarily .
the most common things are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .
the frequency of the most known side effects , which were detected after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population un@@ wi@@ dened shape .
+ It is pl@@ au@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i to conversion in terms of potential and actual g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal side effects can result .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple outlets of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical studies .
the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dose were reported either side effects or similar effects , as at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on examinations on humans and animal can be assumed from a rapid recovery of system@@ ic effects that are attributed to the pas@@ sible characteristics of or@@ li@@ stat .
the therapeutic effect lies at the lumens of the gast@@ ric and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine binding to the active servo @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic lip@@ ase .
clinical studies were derived from clinical trials that 60 mg Or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times daily , blocked absorption of approximately 25 % of the food @-@ fat .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 under@@ lines the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , fet@@ al @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as change of body weight in the course of course ( Table 1 ) and as part of those participants who lost more than 5 % and more than 10 % of its initial balance ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins was with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .
with waist circum@@ ference , the average change amounted to -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat were not meas@@ ur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ li@@ stat ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , sens@@ or@@ ised or@@ li@@ stat in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without indication of a Kum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who were administered to the minimal system@@ ically res@@ or@@ ated dose , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ si@@ sted Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after de@@ formation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , identified almost 42 % of the total surface concentration .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ li@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can be detected no particular danger for human beings .

Alo@@ xi is applied for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , and in case of chemical therapies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nausea and vom@@ iting are ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be created by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( an pharmac@@ euticals , which can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tical ) .
the application of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended to be submitted to the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the active ingredient reduces the binding of one chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the receptors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemical therapies , which are strong or moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in case of chemical therapies a strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) compared to 57 % of those treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
in case of chemical therapies , the moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 189 ) compared to 69 % of those treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission provided an author@@ ization for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute symptoms and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ bodi@@ ly chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate @-@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to a cancer illness .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids created by chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on strike , patients should be monitored by an@@ am@@ nest@@ ling care or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , be careful with the same time gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or they tend to an extension .
unless in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeutic drug , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after receiving chemotherapy .
in pre@@ operative studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was not inhibit@@ ing on the tumor activity of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ c@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady static concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ trot@@ ine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ran@@ id@@ ine , R@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies do not lie before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it be considered necessary by the treated doctor as necessary .
in clinical studies the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly associated with alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive actions and reactions to the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies showed un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of effect to observe .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies , due to the distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is believed to be no effective treatment in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ lin@@ or@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ron .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients showed a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , as well as 250 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron who were intraven@@ ously given day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ related chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ ailing chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the I@@ onic and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved in vent@@ ri@@ cul@@ ars and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study performed at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of I.@@ V. cabin in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a slow elimination of plasma concentration as a slow elimination out of the body with an average termin@@ ale half of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg with healthy and cancer patients dos@@ ing proportional .
after an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
the calculated value of 0.@@ 25 m@@ g. of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was calculated from pharmac@@ ok@@ ane sim@@ ulations on 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the one l@@ ump was 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % have been eliminated via the kidneys and about a further 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic rol@@ lers , which are in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron by less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for the metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower degree , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 is involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable , made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection , the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function distur@@ bing the terminal exposure time and the average system@@ ic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is therefore non @-@ justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of the clinical studies revealed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block up only into very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ e- and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the action of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose escap@@ es in about 30 fold of the therapeutic of people ) that were given every day over two years , led to an incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , epi@@ di@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known but due to the used high doses and because Alo@@ xi is appointed for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low as for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon was supposed to be a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same arz@@ asty , which was already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Card &quot; ) .
Alph@@ on@@ eon was to be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ hal@@ y ) hepatitis C ( one through a virus infection ) .
in case of a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue decreased , in addition , the values of the liver enzymes and al@@ amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are raised in the blood flow .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , stimul@@ ating the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon made data to prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the medicine ) , action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ( hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference rate to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adju@@ sting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ k.@@ h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is known what were the greatest concerns that have led the CH@@ MP to Recomm@@ end@@ ation ?
in addition , concerns have been ex@@ cre@@ ed that the data on the stability of the substance and the market of market should not be sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to the treatment of Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon the disease was re@@ ign@@ ant in more patients than at the reference account ; in addition , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was used to investigate the question , to what extent the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it may be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with cru@@ el@@ abor@@ ated skin infection ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ ds ) , cut @-@ out and wound up wounds .
alt@@ ar@@ ma@@ des should not be used for the treatment of infections which were proven to be caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because alarm can not affect these type of infections .
alt@@ ar@@ rests can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be applied for treated skin surface than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine patients and evaluate alternative treatments .
it acts through block@@ age of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was denied by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under alt@@ ar@@ che@@ on and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin hours , alt@@ ar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in were similar to contact : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin hours , approximately 90 % of patients with both groups spoke to the treatment .
in these two studies , it was noted that the alt@@ ar@@ go was caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ex@@ er@@ ted cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections which were proven to be caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with alt@@ ar@@ rests ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an appeal to the Con@@ tractor .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of alt@@ ar@@ f at the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections weigh over the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , un@@ infected small kill@@ ings , coating or paraly@@ zed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for placing on alt@@ ar@@ ys in the entire European Union .
patients with which no improvement occurred within two to three days , an alternative therapy should be evaluated and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensiti@@ zation or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for treatment , the treatment is canc@@ eled and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen , or is assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary @-@ infected wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered as if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ op@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to its low plasma concentration , which were achieved when people were subjected to top@@ ical skin , or infected high @-@ surface wounds , a clin@@ ically important inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo should not be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ op@@ ulin at AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at the di@@ ced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure of top@@ ical use in patients , dose adap@@ tations will not be required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ ers can be applied during system@@ ic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive response to oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ op@@ ulin should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to provide the gift of a system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic treatment .
at the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the therapy with alt@@ ar@@ go should be completed / terminated , is between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding of the infant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ piece therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the alt@@ ar@@ go was applied , the most common adverse event of the meeting occurred , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of effect is a semi @-@ synthetic D@@ eri@@ v@@ at by P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein syn@@ thetics by interaction with a particular binding set of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial rift which differs from the engagement of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ic anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the engagement stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred centre centre .
by connecting to this binding in@@ hibit P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ isation , block some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active post ri@@ bos@@ omes sub@@ units .
based on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms , a consultation should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ate is sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a failure to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = p@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion and put on the skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma proteins were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medi@@ ation and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 cm2 ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) is 660 times lower than the IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was given primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under small participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in vitro studies on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ oma test and in cultures of human blood @-@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ core test to in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male or female rats signs of reduced fertil@@ ity at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure as the highest exposure of exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 )
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study in rats were diagnosed in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development tools ( reduced weight ) and matern@@ al tox@@ icity .
the holder of the approval for placing an application must ensure that a pharmaceutical @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , such as will be present in the 1.@@ 8.1 version of the application process , and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied .
the holder of the authorisation is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance activities , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP .
as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Cross@@ ine on Risk Management System for the L@@ inal Products for human use , the updated R@@ MP is to be submitted to the next periodi@@ c safety update .
in case of irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place , you should finish the application of alt@@ ar@@ f and talk to your doctor .
don &apos;t apply any other oint@@ ments , cre@@ ams or le@@ vel@@ ons on the surface , which is treated with alt@@ ar@@ go when it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor .
it may not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in female genital area .

it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic bag , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of salt , or in an aluminium bag , which contains 0,5 g of sage .
ambient temperature is applied for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied within one of two doses of existing vaccination plan , where a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if during the immun@@ isation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccination will run from two doses to an end .
if a don@@ or dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , ambient temperature or other hepatitis C or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines works as opposed to the immune system ( the natural origin of the body ) , &quot; how it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and created antibodies against it .
ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix adults , which has been approved since 1997 , has been approved by Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within one of three doses of existing vaccination .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also referred to as receipt for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two injec@@ tions .
ambient concentrations carried out between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix at a six @-@ month period and at a 12 @-@ month interval between injec@@ tions was similar .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , pain at the injection site , re@@ dness , mer@@ it ( ti@@ re@@ dness ) as well as friction .
ambient temperature may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ical s.@@ a. an author@@ ization to the placing of the ambient of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standar@@ dis@@ ation plan for Grun@@ dig mun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a cartridge is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vacc@@ ines or combined with a combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies observed in the same order as after vaccination with the relevant mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully assured whether immune competent individuals who are demanded on an hepatitis A@@ - Imp@@ act , since they may be protected from immune memory when they are no longer proven .
3 . as with all injec@@ tors should be available in the rare case of a aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction according to the gift of the vaccine production , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring must be available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is advised with the combination simple , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , after basic di@@ mm@@ ers under the circumstances , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies can be reached , so in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses can be required .
since an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration is to lead to an optimal Imp@@ act success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected as an exception as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to blood .
when ambient temperature was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cul@@ um m@@ umps which was administered , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ otherapy or patients with immune defects , it may not be possible to achieve adequate immune response .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , re@@ dness , swelling , cur@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever compar@@ ably with the frequency that was observed with the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccination of Ambi@@ rix were given at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of ambient sounds were compared with the combination of the 3 @-@ cans .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and pi@@ ety at a calculation basis per vaccination dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % involving the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses .
according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had received the ambient temperature was more pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % involving the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose content .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ism was comparable high ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ines received at 3@@ 9,6 % of the subjects who were at ambient times compared to 3@@ 6,2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combined ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ uring was low , comparable to that , after administration of the combination , it was observed with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1- until 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines the appearance of local re@@ actions and gener@@ aliz@@ ations in the ambient temperature was comparable to that observed with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with ambient temperature , a Frequ@@ ent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not reported per pro@@ band .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which were more serious side effects during the 2 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ as with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B and surface an@@ tigen , was not different .
in clinical trials that were carried out at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years were the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 , requested dosage ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 , the dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , which was conducted at 12- to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds received 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses .
with the 289 people whose imm@@ unity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ome rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose strains .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans @-@ vacc@@ sch@@ ema with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were at the time of basic di@@ mm@@ ing between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperature and ambient temperature in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune reaction to both anti@@ gens was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of re@@ combined hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12- to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be compared to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is , in@@ activated Poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , type b @-@ vaccination ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps vaccine was administered , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ator and ser@@ o@@ converting rates such as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is both in front and after Res@@ us@@ pen@@ al , as well as to investigate any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis B virus is usually transferred by viral food@@ stu@@ ffs and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as bathing in se@@ aqu@@ eous waters .
they can feel very tired , have a dark urine , p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ low@@ ish ) and other symptoms that may take a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel un@@ comfortable or sick / feel ) an vaccination may not prevent any illness .
protection against other infections which cause liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• When you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( a antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , breathing or swelling of fac@@ ial or tongue . • if you have had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
if you have a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the physician will advise you / your child from a vaccine with ambient temperature .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective hepatitis B vaccine per vaccination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ active hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine is usually given to a month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before the completion of the vaccination series .
sometimes , ambient concentrations of people suffer from severe blood ag@@ ulation disorders , inj@@ ected beneath the skin and not into the muscle . if you / your child are weakened due to a disease or a treatment in your / her body &apos;s own immune system , or if you / your child under@@ takes a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient temperature can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is .
21 Do you need to take your doctor if you / or take your child additional medic@@ ations ( including those that you can receive without wear ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or received your child before recently / has been administered or Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) is planned for the near future .
but it can be , however , that in this case the immune response is not sufficiently defined and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with ambient temperature , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible limb@@ s .
when Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ ac@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction on the vaccine will be sufficient .
usually , ambient / pregnant or breast women is not given , unless it is ur@@ gently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , please contact your doctor and make an appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les available .
based on the data , which have become known since the division of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP represented the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient temperature is positive .
as Ambi@@ rix was only brought to traffic in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to the low patient area .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with in@@ complete enzyme , or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium concentration as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the fore@@ sight .
ammon@@ ite is - split by several single boxes to the meals , mixed with food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ der ( through the abdom@@ inal wall in the stomach of the tube ) or a nose probe ( the nose is used in the stomach of the tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ites cannot be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo agent , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also result in App@@ r@@ ence loss , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , resistance , liquid re@@ tention , taste problems or taste , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the urine cycle to high ammon@@ ium values can be prevented .
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , as due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug are templates .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients , where a complete enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ fixed form ( in@@ complete enzyme , which manifest@@ s after the first month of life ) there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ ese a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with can@@ y@@ al troubles , AM@@ MON@@ APS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated under consideration of the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ th@@ rift in patients with an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ amide or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase is required to be administered in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an arg@@ in@@ ine in@@ ine deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of ec@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a is , if the tablets do not reach the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ APS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MON@@ APS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and ec@@ umen@@ ical clinical conditions only with cau@@ tion .
since Met@@ abol@@ ization and the expression of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at above the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MON@@ APS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS in the pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gifts of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and caused by a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning ner@@ ves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate should be ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans in breast milk , and that reason why the use of AM@@ MON@@ APS is con@@ tra @-@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ APS , at least 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MON@@ APS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old female patient who developed an met@@ abolic opath@@ y in combination with lac@@ tic converter , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tanks and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
one case of an over@@ dose occurred within a 5 month old small child with a random single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ist is a met@@ abolic active connection , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
acet@@ yl@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen in urea with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the separation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the urine cycle can be assumed to be produced for every gram of bias sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started to improve the chances of survival and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early symp@@ tom form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always infectious and the disease did even lead to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ less analog@@ y within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen dioxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ist , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and residual sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born before post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) diagnosed to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients suffering from many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ fixed form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opath@@ y and treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ru@@ al diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also very reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in sober and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tray form , 15 minutes after intake measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary bladder dysfunction or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was detec@@ table .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ ating concentration in plasma concentration on the third day were five times higher than according to the first gifts .
differentiation The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ sted phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules is either taken as oral ( babies and children who can still swal@@ low no tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ouse or an Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum prot@@ esters should be kept in the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ th@@ rift in patients with an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ amide or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase is required to be administered in a dose of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ APS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat oils were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the Hir@@ n@@ rin@@ d .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ APS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old female patient who developed an met@@ abolic opath@@ y in combination with lac@@ tic converter , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tanks and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
acet@@ yl@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen in urea with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ hum@@ ili@@ ation of excess
based on examinations concerning the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the urine cycle , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also very reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical state can occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after the intake measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
for this purpose , the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication at a probe , AM@@ MON@@ APS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ eted waste products , which can accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ APS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MON@@ APS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you take other medicines or recently taken recently , even if it is not prescri@@ ption drug .
during feeding times , you can &apos;t take AM@@ MON@@ APS because it could go over to the mother &apos;s milk and harm to your baby .
in rare cases , turbul@@ ence , headache , taste problems , dec@@ eit , rec@@ ti@@ bility , memory distur@@ b@@ ance and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms at yourself , place your doctor immediately with your doctor , or with the recovery of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you forget the in@@ gest@@ ion of AM@@ MON@@ APS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of the blood balance ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduced appetite , depression , low pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , kidney disease , kidney disease , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects may significantly affect or you side effects that are not listed in this product information .
you may not use AM@@ MON@@ APS after the use of the cart@@ on and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the exp@@ iry date of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like AM@@ MON@@ APS looks and content of the package AM@@ MON@@ APS tablets are of whit@@ ish colour and oval shape and they are equipped with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ anti@@ es &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest cor@@ k with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an abnormal measuring value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ac disease or E@@ KG ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered , and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS unit , where the effect of angi@@ ox on a couple of gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ary ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in .
at the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in case of preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox@@ in relation to all the indicators equally effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for serious bleeding , where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other stags , or any of the other components .
moreover , it is not allowed to be applied to patients who recently had an bleeding , as well as people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came in due to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . an approval for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ anti@@ es ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ) in case of emergency relief ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) or if necessary , early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous membrane of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another sequence a PCI should be given an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the use of clinical trials , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours .
an accumulation of 0.5 mg / kg may be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ opla@@ sty .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI surgery is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second layer should be charged at 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before applying and the bolt dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , additional monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restrictions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( if using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second layer dose of 0.3 mg / kg is required , and the ACT 5 minutes after the second breast@@ plate again test again .
in patients with moderate kidney damages , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adap@@ tion at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe ren@@ dering damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .

patients are carefully developed during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood supply , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ary ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if a PCI @-@ patient under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in occur in most of the bleeding in arter@@ ial points , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment of basically any bleeding .
in patients who take War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ons , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) should be ensured to ensure that the value after separation of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was reached again before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ant ) , it can be assumed that these substances are increasing the risk of blood .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation@@ ers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sions , clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ lob@@ sters are regularly to control in any event .
the experimental studies are insufficient in terms of impact on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ adequate or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

an AC@@ U@@ ITY has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in at the point of point , reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known blood supply , Re@@ operation due to an bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ation@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal , g@@ astro@@ intest@@ inal , ear , nose or neck .
the following statements about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6,000 patients who undergo a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ y@@ in Group as well as in patients treated with He@@ par@@ in treated comparative groups were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years .
both light and severe bleeding came to significantly less than in the reference group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above have been reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is immediately torn down and the patient is close to evidence of a blood circulation .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ der , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as to the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ in region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in a liquid phase or t@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ons in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in moves slowly up the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which means that the functioning of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .
moreover , by bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients who had come in the past to he@@ el @-@ induced thro@@ po@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , there were no thro@@ cy@@ tes ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in demonstrated a dos@@ ing and concentration of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is governed by ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed below a PCI , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of AC@@ U@@ ITY trial , He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin has been administered to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quadru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study with over 6,000 patients subjected to a PCI ( version 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ic properties of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in were evaluated in patients who subjected themselves to a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is expected to pass a cat@@ abolic disease in its amino acid components with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary met@@ abo@@ lit , resulting from the Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 @-@ binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
the elimination will take place in patients with normal ren@@ al kidney function after a process of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ li@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity or reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data can not recognize any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra ( under the skin ) is inj@@ ected into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh , or the upper arm or in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin can not be processed .
insulin is very slight from human@@ ities , and the change signi@@ fies that it acts qui@@ cker than a short period of activity than a short @-@ term human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a durable insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes where insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ ic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was reduced from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra , compared to 0.@@ 30 % of the normal normal temperature .
A@@ pi@@ dra can not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) to insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering an hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if it is administered together with a range of other medicines that can effect on the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission presented San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH , an author@@ ization to the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection using either in the abdom@@ inal wall , th@@ igh or the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous co@@ aches through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of abdom@@ inal cord .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin resistance , the insulin need may be lower in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
each change of the efficiency level , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ off , etc . ) , the species of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can attract a change in the insulin requirements .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or dos@@ ing of a treatment , in particular in patients with a insulin requiring diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and a di@@ abe@@ tic converter ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under severe medical supervision and may require a change to the dosage .
the timing of an hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active effect of the used insulin profile and can therefore change from the treatment of the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that enhance blood glucose levels and enhance the inclination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ des , op@@ gi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , oxid@@ ox@@ et@@ in , mono@@ xide oxide , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , ro@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate and sulph@@ ur@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ oly@@ tics such as st@@ ables , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ener@@ able head@@ land weakened or missing .
animal experiments on re@@ productive studies showed no differences between in@@ su@@ pre@@ mat@@ ism and human @-@ insulin regarding the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether the insulin delivery occurs in the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general , insulin occurs neither into the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ised according to oral application .
listed below are the clinical trials identified , group@@ ed according to system organs and ordered after decreasing frequency of their upgrades ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of the existing templates ) .

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is ref@@ uted to change the injection site within the injection site , can occur in the after@@ math of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phi@@ de at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des with consciousness can be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ated person , or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose ag@@ itation , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood glucose levels by stimul@@ ating the peripheral glucose consumption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ al of insulin is performed faster and the operation time is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ in showed a proportional effect of glu@@ ing effect , and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in glu@@ ing effect , exactly as human @-@ insulin .
insulin sh@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast active effect as normal human @-@ insulin and achieves the complete motion @-@ energy effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human @-@ insulin .
from the data it was evident that an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable post@@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
in 2 minutes before the meal , is@@ ec@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal , was given a better post@@ den@@ ial control than with human@@ ized Normal @-@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin is ge@@ aring in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the beginning of a meal ( Figure 1A ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as in comparison to human normal levels , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ M@@ AL - before a meal ) ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - down@@ wards ) after the beginning of a meal in comparison to human Nor@@ - painters , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ M@@ AL - before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
