<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has been assessed in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the packet stage (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. genres thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • bipolar-I-disorder, mental illness, where patients mantic episodes have alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of severe or severe episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients suffering from the medicine used in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to rapid control of increased disruption or behavioral disturbance if the ingestion of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used for insertion or the melting tablets in patients who prepares the hats of tablets trouble.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are using other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which enable the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower degree than the neurotransmitters affects the receptors to activate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine has a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to normalize the activity of the brain, causing mental or manic symptoms and recovery is avoided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, the revival of the symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused by a placebo compared to placebo for a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abijam was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which could occur in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered in isolated unrest that compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients were examined using a standard scale of bipolar disorder or the number of patients who were addressed to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also resulted in studies in order to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to insert (receive).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reduction of symptoms increased lessness than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manoeuvre than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to a period of 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the recovery of manic episodes with previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased more effectively than placebo which increased symptoms and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Ablify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extraordinates (uncontrolled movement), headache, blurred vision, dyspine (distiffness), vomiting hypersecretion (increased memory production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, solict (sleep disturbance) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The UN Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify during treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to the treatment of Aripiprazol compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injection solution for rapid control of increased discomfort and behavioural troubles in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I-error, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission provided an authorization to the European Union of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY has been shown for the treatment of severe and severe episodes of bipolar disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment of Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proved, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as a monootherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With view of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Intor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicides is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders in some cases, after the beginning or after changing of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicides in terms of antithesis by Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, infectious disease), cerebrovac disease, conditions that are used for hypotonia (dehydration) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that one year or less continued, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazol open Dyskinesie.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients were treated at an ABILIFY screening and symptoms of a late dyskinfusion, the dose should reduce or reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mns indicate or a clear fever without an additional clinical manifestations of mns, all antipsychotics must be abolished including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol was to be used in patients with crampage in the anamnese or with states that are related to crampages in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol were a higher risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosing, a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for unwanted rovitic events in with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with Ketoazidi or hyperosmolarem coma, or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antigens, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related undesirable events with ABILIFY and other atypical antigens treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain in general in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manie due to comporbidity, the use of antipsychotics, observed in weight gain as a side effect, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system be careful when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central medicines such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers an ultra-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripiprazol around 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetin, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisans can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint venture of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY in consideration, the potential benefits should sustain potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After removal of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosage height before the beginning of the escale therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diazorem or Escudiram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated using a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol had no significant effect on the metabolism of the substranism of CYP2D6 (demethadmethadan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Warfarrazol) and 3A4 (deplmethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if she's pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data security in humans and due to the inadequate data on animals, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are sure that Aripionzol had no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under Placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the adverse events specified below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, acathic, Dystony and Dyskinesie on, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo controlled long-term study about 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was among those under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled longterm study about 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olantine Therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients treated under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medically important differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine monoshokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol treated patients, compared to 2.0% of treated patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and over their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazol, the malignant neuroleptosis syndrome, inundesirable muscular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate replicants with Aripiprazol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the effectiveness of a hemoralysis in the treatment of an overdose of Aripiprazol. however, it is unlikely that hedalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefits because Aripiprazol has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficiency of Aripiprazol with schizophrenia and bipolar-I error about the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors are mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity for the Dopamine D2- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrye and to the Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed a doscope dependent reduction of the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor lignot, at the Nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled study 52% of the response of the response rates included a response to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- Depressions-scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study about 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia demonstrated a significantly higher reduction in the recovery rates, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ovarian in-controlled, multinational double blind study at schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential 'weight gain' occurred among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I error, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior to placebo for reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior effectiveness against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled Monotherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I error, with or without mental features, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior performance of week 3 and an informational effect comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of Mania, such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I error, with or without mental function, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in the reduction of manic symptoms in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo controlled study about 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients treated with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase in relation to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relenteous humor.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the expansion of Aripiprazol, which is catalyst by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The median of the elimination time was nearly 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolic rollers over CYP2D6 and with almost 146 hours in 'bad' (= "Poor") Metabolisans over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in the Pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, and in an pharmacokically investigation with schizophrenic patients showed no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics was no indication of clinically significant differences in relation to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking at Aripiprazol Pharmacology.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokic properties of Aripiprazol and Elydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study of subjects with different gradient of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the liver function of Aripiprazol and Elydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to pull battles on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies of safety spliology, toxicity in repeated gift, reproduction, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, clinical data could not recognize any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that exceed maximum dose or exposure to people, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects collected a dosshellrina- pigment Accumulation (AUC) in rats to 104 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3-100,000mg / kg / day (corresponding in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a choleliorasis was determined by Aripiprazol in the Galle of monkey from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3fold of the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and lie well below the limits (6%) of the concentrations in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to Expositions of 3- and 11times the mid Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane patients and was severe (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In table 1, the side effects are listed which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abraxane as a monotherapist at each dose and indications in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased liquedehydrogenase in the blood, elevated blood sugar, increased phosphorus in blood, reduced potassium in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dystagie, Bats, affgeness, dry mouth, painstiness of gum, ruthophagitis, pains in the mouth, oral pain, rectoral bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the breastplate, weakness of musculature, genital pains, abdominal pain, muscle pains, pain in the skeleton muscles, fade pain, discomfort in the structures, muscle pains Very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Orestorescence 1 The frequency of the incidence of sensitivity is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of actual frequency, and there was no correlation with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtuli-substance which promotes the combination of the microtubules from the Tubular indigenous and stabilized the microtubuli by inhibiting of its dependisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibiting of the normal dynamic reorganization of microtubular network, which is essential for the vitale interphase and the mitotic tissue functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well-known that it conveys the transcytosis of plasma cells into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies have been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of Paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendotheliale transport is conveyed by the gp-60-Albuminrereceptor and due to the albuminous protein (ented protein acidic rich in cysteine) a Paclitaxel accumulation in the field of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two inclusive studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated using Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion about 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated with Paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 than a 3-hour infusion with prevention of allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">At inclusion in the study 64% of patients had an admittedly common condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestosis.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had no chemotherapy yet, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% for metastases and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity in contrast to Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree of patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy on baseline on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmaceutical Paclitaxel in total Paclitaxel after 30- and 180 minutes infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active exposition (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous gift of Abraxane, patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the Paclitaxel plasma concentration towards multiphasic ways.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume has a far-reaching extravagulary distribution and / or turnouts of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced sound tumours, pharmacological properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane compared with a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent medium Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift higher (43%) than according to a solvent acacaxel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of the factual liver microsome and tissue coated, it is reported that Paclitaxel is primarily metabolised to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolic (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolite 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="362">In patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood circulation, Abseam is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his counselor, as long as they have received an appropriate manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">Patients with chronic kidney insufficiency and patients receiving chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilonite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiencies exists, and iron failures should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietinmangel, or caused that the body is not adequate for the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin also use operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been brought to the formation of epoxetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abandamed was compared to a vein in the context of a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems caused by the reference failure.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks after Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either converted to Abseam or continued Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the study period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin speckled Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients were changed to the same degree as in those patients who still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continue to have Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common adverse event of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, migraine like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseam may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) to epoxetine alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems because other studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the drug has been provided for a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo, pursuant to the regulations of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anämiesymptome and followings can be different depending on age, gender and total disease-last; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trial and disease resistance is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients occasionally, individual hemoglobin values can be observed over or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to be achieved through 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or exceeds the long-term hemoglobin value 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoxin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">The patients should be monitored close to ensure that epetine alfa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anmianymptome.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses for patients suffering from initial anemia (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses for patients suffering from initial anemia (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">The patients should be monitored close to ensure that epetine alfa is in the lowest approved dose which is required for the inspection of anesymptome.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reverulocytes increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value, the dose should be kept from 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 i.e. / kg a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Reverulozytenant increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">In contrast, the hemoglobin value by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Reverulocytes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, a response to the epetine alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required, should have been received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgical procedure.</seg>

<seg id="422">The decision for the application recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk suction under the participation of the respective patients, which should take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for an individual elective orthopedic procedure, if possible, before the beginning of the epic-alfa-therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopedic procedure should have an increased risk of thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombopic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • with postmenopausal women • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hill fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men a intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hill fracture the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks after operating provision of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the moray Paget Aclasta only was prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the moray Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the moray Paget with Aclasta a long reduction period of patients observed was observed in patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to assure patients with moray Paget sufficient intake of calcium, accordingly to at least 500 mg elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hill fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 i.e. oral or intramuscults vitamin D was recommended in front of the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta, may be reduced by the gift of acetamol or Ibuprofen shortly after applying Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function (see section 4.4) For patients with cancer in Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experiences for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination with older patients similar to younger ones.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended to use for the application in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data are missing for the unthinkable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as for this patient's population only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">An existing hypokalcemia is before the beginning of the therapy with Aclasta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledronc acid on bone structure, a temporary basis can develop with symptomatic hypokalcemia, whose maximum is usually occur within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to assure patients with moray Paget sufficient intake of calcium, accordingly to at least 500 mg elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="610">Kidney failure Zoledronic was associated with kidney failure, which itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum cancer) and in rare cases expressed as acute kidney failure, in conjunction with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinin Clearance (measured every year before the administration) and the onset of kidney failure, as well as a limited kidney function, were comparable to osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinins within 10 days of the gift was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta patients, compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were treated below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study to postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on avoidance of clinical trials after a hatfracture and in the Morbus-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on avoidance of clinical fractures, the vitamin D mirror were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion place, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekroses in the Kiev area was borrowed, especially in cancer patients, over osteonekroses (primarily in the jaw area) reported with bisphosphonate, including coledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections, including osteopathitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after dental implants or other dental components.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7.736 patients showed osteonekrosis in the jaw area at one with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose that leads to a clinically relevant hypokalcemia, it can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconia.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The effectiveness and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was found in postmenopausal women (7.736 women at the age between 65 and 89 years) with either two mild or moderate existing cycline fracture or a BMD-T score for the scarf -2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycline fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric cyclones Aclasta significantly improved over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebrates (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and over had a 60% reduction in risk of vertebrates compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk for fractures over three years (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta raised the bone density at the Leninvertebra, hips and the distal radius compared to placebo-treatment (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increasing the bone density of the Leninvertebral column by 6.7%, the whole thigh um 6.0%, the crankshahum 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology contains 152 postmenopausal osteoporic patients who were treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies taken from the pelvic tribe.</seg>
<seg id="628">Microcomputer symptoms (µCT) analysis showed with Aclasta treated patients compared to placebo an increase of trabearing bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphate (BSAP), the N terminale propeptid of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients with periodic intervals during the time period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP has been reduced significantly by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 i.e. oral or intramuscularly) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The whole mortality was 10% (101 patients) treated with Aclasta group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) in the Horizon-RFT study increased the acetlasta treatment in comparison to placebo-treatment the BMD in total heat and scans hals for all points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta Treatment conducted over 24 months compared to placebo-treatment to increase the BMD around 5.4% and 4.3% at the crankshaft.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men in the Horizon-RFT study were randomised to 508 men and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men; the incidence of clinical trials was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study of men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta is related to the percentage change of the lumber vertebrae BMD to 24 months compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget from the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radiologically confirmed moray Paget of the bone (medium serum) of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6fold and 3.0fold age specific upper normal level in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared with the intake of 30 mg of risedronat once a day during 2 months was detected in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">With the combined results, a similar decrease in the pain intensity and pain influencing was observed in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a response phase at the end of the six-month study (on the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and 107 with risedronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach obtained with 141 of patients with Aclasta, compared to 71 of patients with risedronat, are maintained during a median duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosisirrespective.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma concentration rose rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rascal biphasic vanishing from the big circulation system with half-life times t ½ -0.24 and t 1 ½ -1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination of elimination with a terminal elimination round about ½ hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above 1 ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption of the bones and the differentiation of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the requested dose were found in urine, while the rest is mostly bound to bone fabric.</seg>
<seg id="650">The aggregate body Clearance is irrespective of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledronacid concentration increased by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no impact on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearing from by cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolic systems is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolic by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, fuel dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patients (see section 4.2) correlated clearing of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine Clearance, namely, 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in fact that a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function of up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adaptation of the colietic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for heavy kidney function (Kreatinsolvency Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-working intravenous single dose was in mice 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC is the 6times the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2 - 3 weeks (an cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7times the human therapeutic exposure (corresponding to AUC, corresponds to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long term studies with repeated use of cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxic effects of other organs, including the Gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated use was a majority of primary Spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a report that reflects the pharmacological, anti-oxidant effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one teratogenicity observed at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">On rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity were expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lowest serum calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public this document is a summary of the European Public Service Report (EPAR), which is explained in detail as the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) which has been evaluated in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes), where Metformin (a diabetic agent) is not shown. • It can be applied together with another diabetic medication (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition, Metformin patients (especially overweight patients) can be applied, which can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphuric resin or insulin, the previous dose of the Sulphylamide / insulin may be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of the sulphglycol and the insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be enhanced by means of the blood sugar level, meaning type 2 diabetes is better adjustable.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphuric resin; in addition, they received either Actos or placebo up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemic hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how good the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered at doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with Metformin and a sulphuric resin in a decrease of HbA1c values decreased 0.94% while the additional donation of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin had been examined at 289 patients, the patients who account for insulin had a decrease of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to placebo in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were longsuffering, infections of the upper respiratory tract (cold), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used either in patients who may respond to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic converter (high blood pressure - acidity level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment in patients as an alternative to the standard treatment of metformin patients, of which metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission announced the takeover of Actos Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing an account for placing an account in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also displayed for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate for which metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility is unsuitable (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age are not available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients receiving at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attacks or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should begin with the lowest available dose and increase the dose progressively.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and ecdeme if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced masturgeon disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase in reports of cardiac insufficiency which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver rating (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the limit of the normal range of the normal range, the liver values are thus possible to control the liver values as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If one patient developed symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplanatory nausea, vomiting, upper degradation, fatigue, appessness and / or darker Harn, are the liver rating values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should continue, should be led by the laboratory of the laboratory of clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosismal weight gain has been proven that can stir in fat deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a Häoglitazone a slight reduction in the average hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed for similar trials involving Pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients, Pioglitazone is known as an oral two-scale or triple-combination therapy with insulin delivery or as a two-scale combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing mortglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, the treatment with Thiazolamide, including Pioglitazone, was reported on a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular oedema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear if there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular deples if patients should report on disturbances of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages of adverse events, randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 questionnaires per 100 patient years, treated with Pioglitazone women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone who were treated with Pioglitazone in people compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or enter this entry, treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the investigation of the interaction have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenotoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contractiva, Cyclosporin, Calciumkanalnaked and HMGCoA-Reductasynmer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Gemfibromus (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone around the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction in AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and refraction of the lens as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic effects.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT calls for three times the upper limit of the standardization region as often as under Placebo, but more rarely more than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulphylharnis.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with the existing advanced scopovascular disease, the frequency of a serious cardiac insufficiency on Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazone bzan.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported on congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of messages of adverse events, randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazone groups and more than 7.400 patients treated with associated mediation groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years ongoing proactive study, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on an activation-specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It was shown that Pioglitazone reduces the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapist was continued over two years in order to examine the time up to follow the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be observed by Pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of the patients below Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three imonated optimisation phase with insulin exposure to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continue to achieve insulin; a reduction of insulin-dose associated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decline of the albumin / Kreatinin creditations compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small study on 18 weeks of study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- cholesterol level as well as a slightly improved LDL- Cholesterinspiegel was observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced in comparison to Plazebo, Metformin or Gliclazid the total plasmatic glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase of LDL-Cholesterinspiegel was found in the LDL-Cholesterinspiegel, while under Metformin and Gliclazid reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postdendial enhanced triglyceride mirror, this both via a effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced masturgeon disease were randomized to groups that received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After an oral application, Pioglitazone gets resorly resorly, with the leading concentrations of the Pioglitazone in plasma generally takes 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interact studies, Pioglitazone could not prove the relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenotoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrous (a cytochrome P450 2C8 - Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following an oral application of radioactive aroglitazone in humans the markers was mainly found in threads (55%) and at a lower degree in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The median plasma-elimination of plasma from unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours for humans and the total active metabolic rate lies at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers, but the instalments of the oral clearing of the motherland is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In mice, rats, dogs and Monkeys in mice, rats, dogs and Monkeys were repeated after repeated planting, anemia and reversible heart-hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">Long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by the rat dencies of hyperplAsia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the bladder epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the Proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazone who were treated with Pioglitazone in people compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) with patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study on two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or licliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decline of the albumin / creatinin crewess showed a statistically significant decrease in the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postdendial enhanced triglyceride mirror, this provides both a effect on the Tryglyceride absorption, as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to demonstrate their primary endpoints, a combination of the whole mortality, stroke, acute coronarism, leg amputation on the Knuckening, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the ingestion of Pioglitazone has no risk of cardiovascular risk.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or immune soup.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintain a corresponding daily dosage; modification of the formulation or regime's control should be performed only under the tight control of a medical certificate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus will remain.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups in special patient groups with reduced liver function and prevention of blood cells in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As kidney function exercises no influence on the Pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum concentration, a calculation of creatinine and monitoring of urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover to Ciclosporin on Advantf At the conversion of a Ciclosporn on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is recommended (see section 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood pressure level of Tacrolimus should also be checked after switching from Prograf on Advantf, Dosiscustomization, changes to immuntizing therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that might change the Tacrolimus-whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advantf is a drug with a low clearing, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of the valley must not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talesis of Tacrolimus lies in the whole blood in the first time according to liver transplanations, usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and adrenal transplanted patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">As a rule, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml was used during the subsequent edification of liver, kidney and heart transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including transplants and other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and maintain a corresponding daily dosage; modification of the formulation or regime's control should be performed only under the tight control of a medical certificate (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentration in the blood is offered since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to significant variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was referred to as Kardiomyopathy, aqueous humor or septum-hypertrophies, which can be observed also among Advantf.</seg>

<seg id="1483">Transport transplantation In an interim analysis over a recent run, multi-centre study with oral Prograf was reported over 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within a 1: 1 Randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In the first year after the transplantation, bronchiolitis obliter- syndrome was also less frequently observed after the transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus patients, it came to 21.7% of cases in the emergence of a bronchiolitis nonfiction compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosers had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted to Ciclosus on Ciclosus (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low hematritual and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or one by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing of the Clearance payments.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolic before the excreator, whereby the excretion is mainly made over the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) at Advantf (twice daily) at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than in Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advantaneous bleeding is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a deficiency of factor VIII, inned bleeding).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application can be addressed to whether Advate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII, which causes blood pressure problems like bleeding in the joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been brought to the formation of the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, however, it is produced differently because the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was analysed with prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advances at the prevention of blood levels in 86% of 510 new blood pressure were awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances must not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) against human scent factor VIII, Mauser or Hamsterprotein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to grant approval for the placing of Advence in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of the substitution therapy follow after the severity of factor VIII-deficiency, after the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">The factor VIII activity in the respective period should not drop under the stated plasma concentration (in% of the norm or in i.e. / dl) in the respective period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until pain and acute damage has been eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours for patients under 6 years), until the risk of patients is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment course it is required to the control of the recommended dose and frequency of injections to a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, ranging in vivo recovery and have different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of blood vessels with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma should not be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The transfer rate should be addressed to the patients, whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">Formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG lobuline, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days are the largest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 extrusions and anamnistic Inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product was observed on another, the re-act of (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Because of the rare rise of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and still life.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Patients with the largest number of patients occurring in patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for education of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the available data available since the initial approvals, the CHMP has continued to be beneficial as a positive value, but in consideration that the safety profile is closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the approvals for approval in 5 years is to apply for further extension.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially distributed the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the company receives his application for a grant from Advantin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, these are the breast, the brain, bone or female parts (tissue, which links other structures in the body, surrounds and relies).</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that was genetically modified in such a gene that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advocin, it is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so it has no copies of themselves, and therefore no infections can trigger people.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advspine would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to make the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made of non-defective in the human body, is usually formed to recovering damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni's cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company consisted of data from a study involving a patient who stood at Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the area of the basement, into the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has examined the answers to the questions presented, some questions were still unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of the initial documents, the CHMP has created 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advantine is presented in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of medicines in the body, the type of administration and the security of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not demonstrated that Advocin can be manufactured in a reliable way, and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not know that the CHMP has not been aware of whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or "Compassiate-Use" programmes with Advocin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay carving, caused by an allergy to pollen-caused inflammation of the nose-detachment) in patients with hooks-smug (silent nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents ages 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose skin (stored noses), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medication can be repeated on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects of the main effects were the changes of the criterizing of the hay pushes atoms that were reported from the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all the Grasshopper ymptome, the patients who had Aerinaze were reported on a decrease in symptoms of 46.0% compared to 35.9% compared to patients who had pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose has been viewed, the patients showed a reduction in the symptoms of 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients treated by Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedycarts (heart-hunt), malaygitis (throat), angling, headache, fatigue, insomnie (insomnia), Somnolence (Sleeps), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) against disinloratadin, pseudoephedrin or one of the other components, against adrents active substances or Loratadin (another drug to the treatment of allergies), are not used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension) or hemorrhagic stroke (caused by brain cancer) or having a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval to the Company SP Europe to take a grant from Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is in the whole to swallow (i.e. without it to crushes, break or to digest).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be applied due to the lack of data to unthinkable and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) not for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after shooting of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as at long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can take from time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper breaths, the treatment may be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains, the drug is also contra-indicated with patients treated with a monoxide (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity of pseudozers such as Bromocripitin, Pergolid, Cabergolin, Ergoamine, dihydrootamine, phenyllephrin, phenyllephrin, phenyllephrin, Ephylephrin, oxide particles, oxhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient-collective-collective and the data do not suffice to address the appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver redundancy, and the data do not suffice to address the appropriate recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment with occurrence of hypertension or hypertension, cardiac disease, nausea or any other neurological symptom disorders (such as headaches or a reinforcement of headaches) must be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with cardiac abnormalities • Patients with hypertension • People with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder, or bronchbuasmus in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamine otherwise could prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, in the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, erythropoycin or Ketoconazol, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of disinloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychedelic tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the treated patients treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadin had been taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibited in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibited and neither a substrate or an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconcession of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities as compared to the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since recovery studies are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictoral properties of pseudoephedrin should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, the patients should be clarified however that in very rare cases, it can occur in very rare cases which can lead to a disturbanability of road resistance or ability to serve machines.</seg>

<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flight volume, including the gain subjective punctuality or the tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of strokes compared to placebo was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin at the recommended dosage can cause more sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonical rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine pathoantagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined on the basis of the total cores for the symptom (except nasal-smug), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal-sleic skin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study to the pharmacokinetic study of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerinaze at healthy volunteers over 14 days the flowing weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrin was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of an pharmacokulatory study, which was conducted with formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it was found that four volunteers Desloratadin poorly recycled.</seg>
<seg id="1700">The exposure (Cmax and AUC) study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrin, according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrin, was a exposure according to the gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal-catalrhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms (juckreiz, number and size of squares, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to demonstrate that the body takes the syrup, the solution to insert and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">At allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius showed an average decrease of symptoms (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria, the decrease of symptoms followed after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to placebo and 33% treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) against Desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe, an authorization for the placing of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet is once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent Rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience of clinical trials for the efficacy of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be terminated in accordance with the previous disease and may end after the result of the symptoms and their reacts are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During persisting allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) it can be recommended for the patient during the allergy term.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythropoycin or Ketoconazol were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, Aerius and alcohol was not intensified at the same time taking alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, the patients should be clarified however that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to impairment or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius were reported in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were reported more often than in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young people aged 12 to 17, the most common adverse effect of headaches occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and with 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, administered by up to 45 mg of desloratadin (Neunfold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the charging of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 of human mastcells / bophila as well as the expression of the expression of the adhesion P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple outlets, in the Desloratadin, a dose of up to 20 mg. a day was administered over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiac effects were described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth-time clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosis- study with adults, Desloratadin has no effect on standard measurement variables, including the gain subjective punctuality or the tasks that are connected to the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the lens of symptoms such as Niesen, Nasensecretion, and Juckreiz of the nose, Juckreiz, Tränension and Roman's eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally, perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent Rhinitis in intermittent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as an occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent Rhinitis will be defined as an occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the total energy efficiency of the quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was investigated as representative for further forms of Urtikaria, as the underlying pathophysiology explores in different forms of forms and chronic patients can be randomised and spectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine release is a causal factor in all the human illnesses, Desloratadin is also evident in other forms of formataria for improvement of the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies of antihistamine in chronic idiopathic Urtikaria, the minority of patients who did not react to anti-histamine disease were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of Judaism by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with deserloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and juniper, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate the variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In an Pharmacokinetic study, where patients were comparable to patients with the general seasonallergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients had a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no points for clinical-relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible, however, has not yet been identified, causing interactions with other drugs to be excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibited in-vivo no CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibited and neither a substrate or an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty acids, calorie rich breakfast) does not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin, with a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxicity in desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies of safety spliology, toxicity in repeated gift, genotoxicity and the Reproductive response, the preclinical data of desloratadin cannot recognize any special dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent Rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The congruelling doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections, or anatomical anomalies should play a role in diagnosis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin trials.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against influenza, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which may cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause an future pandemic to protect.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out if a new strain of the influenza virus, which can easily spread from man to humans because people don't have immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">According to administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the Grippevirus as "body-alien" and it forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Therefore, the immune system is able to form a fast antibody in contact with a Grippevirus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the diaphragm of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as body-alien), are cleaned and are used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with "Good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for the evaluation of the security of the vaccine is not to be fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA region in the EMEA vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase stands as a solution for inclusion, but these cannot be taken along with knights as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should first be prescribed when the doctor has examined which antiviral drugs taken before the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus may appeal to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenase is reduced in combination with other antiviral drugs to the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not able to cure diseases, but may have the damage to the immune system, and thus avoiding the development of HIV infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who previously did not have been treated with protease.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Agenine reinforced drug Agenase has been compared with 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitor, with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (virusload) or the change of the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who previously did not have a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks of Agenase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml of placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase has also reduced the virusload, but of the children who previously treated with the protease, only very few were addressed to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protease, the drug Agenase increased the viruslast according to 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease, it came under Agenase with kegavir to a stronger waste of the viruslast after four weeks than in patients who had previously managed their previous protease:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be applied in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against Amendavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may not be used in patients who are currant (a vegetable supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are equally dismantled as Agenase and are beneficial in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines referred to HIV, patients who possess Agenase (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonekrosis (onset of bone fabric) or an immunreactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection that caused the recovery immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat the HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">In general, Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetamp Ritcavir, but the committee determined that the benefit of Agenase in combination with rikavir in patients who previously did not have a protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances, as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information templates.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited, an authorization to the placing of Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokise Booy of Amendavir, together with low doses of kaviavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amendavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amendavir as a solution for inclusion is 14% less than from Amendavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of Amendavir twice a day, combined with other antiretroviral drugs twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Agenase capsules are applied without the increased amount of knights (Booy), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20mg of Amendavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amendavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of knights or other protease were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for infinity and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmaceuticals data, the dose of Agenase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be used in patients with mild or moderate liver abuse with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the curiskraut (hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amendavir during the ingestion of Amendavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that it continues to develop opportunist infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenase capsules should be applied together with low doses of knights and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with the existing liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction among antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenase and kegavir with fluoroscason or other Glukokorcoids, which can be exchanged via CYP3A4 is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment systemic cortibility effects including moray Cushing and suppression of the epithelial function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the absorption of the HMG Coa tube-reducer Hemastatin and Simvastatin strongly depends on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of agenres and Simvastatin is not recommended due to increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomicolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drug, which may cause serious or life threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenottoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under monitoring the International standardization ratio), methods used to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients receiving these medicines at the same time, Agenase can be less effective because of lower plasma concentration of Amendavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the ability of metabolisation interactions with Amendavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be changed, however the information is not enough to appreciate the kind of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amendavir, patients should therefore be monitored in opium-related symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of knights.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity in the Agenase solution of the Agenase solution, this formulation is contra-coated with children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenase should be set on a duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitor, diabetes mellitus was reported via the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia in combination with the development of a diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with pharmaceutical-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders, associated with associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hedophilation patients (Type A and B) that were treated with the protease of infection, there are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous hematopans and hematthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral response (ART) is able to develop an anti-inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residuous opportunist infections which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol protein index), cases of osteonekrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenase may not be given at the same time using medication which represent a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width of Agenres must not be given along with medicines, whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma and / or life threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in AUC of Amendavir which can lead to a virological reasoning and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the low plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often observed adverse effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Curiskraut (hypericum perforatum) The serum concentration of Amendavir can be abated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with curiskraut (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes part in the Order of Johanniskraut, Amendavirens and, if possible, to check the virusload and add the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptation for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amendavir (see also Efavid below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amendavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Amendavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir twice daily, confirming efficacy and safety of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreases if Amendavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg kavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amendavir in plasma, which were achieved with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amendavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg kavirus.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing preparation for the simultaneous administration of Amendavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to be a tight monitoring due to the effectiveness and inconcession of this combination.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study to use Agenase in combination with didanosene, but is advised due to a touch of didanosin, that the revenues from Didanosin and Agenase are at least one hour apart (see instructions below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, at the gift of Efavirz in combination with Amendavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirz in combination with Amendavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitor and existing limited data can be discouraged that nevirapeseed in the serum concentration of Amendavir may be used.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, it is recommended that Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced and potentially harmful plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are applied together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitor should be made, as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Amendavir and Ritonavir is difficult to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amendavir and Riazutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of at 193%, making side effects associated with pulp.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, at least one of the recommended dose should be at least half of the recommended dose, if no clinical data is at least half of the recommended dose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythropoycin were not performed, however the plasma concentration of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamavir and 100 mg of ketoconazol once a day led to 2,69times a day compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of Ketoconazol once daily without the simultaneous application of Fosambusavir with kaviavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, among them substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied jointly with Agenase, possibly at interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be restricted to toxic reactions, associated with these medicines, if they are used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease, it is advisable that Antazida can not be taken at the same time as Agenase, as it can come to resorption disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-volcanic conva, known as an enrollers (phenyltoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with Amendavir can lead to a lower plasma level of Amendavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium blockers such as Amlodipin, dicular pin, divisible pin, Nicodidipin, Nickdipin, Niodidipin, Niodidipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amendavir, which may possibly increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous consumption of Agenase can considerably increase plasma concentrations and amplify PDE5 inhibitors in connection side effects including hypotension, longsuffering and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study conducted in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day, along with 50 µg of fluoromppionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous Cortisol increased by approximately 86% (90% interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenase with kegavir is not recommended to cope with this Glukokorcoids, unless the possible benefit of a treatment systemic cortibility affects the effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-Coa-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4 and are expected to expect plasma concentration at an eventual administration of Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma cuts of these HMG Coa reductase inhibitors can lead to Myopathy including a Rhabdomolysis, the combined use of these medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabilisation of mirrors, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by the same gift of Amendavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase may not be applied together with oral maldazolam (see section 4.3) while at the same time use of Agenase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneously use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors on a possible increase in plasma concentration of Midazolam around 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amendavir, patients should therefore be monitored in opium-related symptoms, especially if there are still low doses of knights.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of its low reliability of historical verses, no recommendation can be given as the Amendavir- dose to be given if Amendavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same time gift of warfarin or other ortic anticoagulsions together with Agenase, an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) is advised due to the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of knights on hormonal contractiva is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time gift of Agenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medication may only be applied to the possible risks for the fetus in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of activated rats Amendavir related substances were detected, but it is not known whether Amendavir is over to people in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats that was administered by the monotation into the uterus until the end of the still life Amendavir, showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight at the postage.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of a descendant, including Fertility and Reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Amendavir to the mothertier.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The unthinkable of Agenase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of these side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were mild to moderate, coming early, and placed rarely for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified if it is used in connection with the ingestion of Agenase or another at the same time as to the HIV treatment of used drugs, or whether they are a consequence of the rounder disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned adverse events are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with protease inhibitors received 1,200 mg of Agenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) performed by the investigator as in connection with study medication, were listed and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as the treatment of laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with an distribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) of HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and factive tissue tissue, multiplied intraocular and visceral fat tissues, hypertrophies of the breasts and dorsovikal fat collection (stitches).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral substances that were treated with Amendavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a medium duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bulldozers) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTI- previously treated patients under Amendavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients (11%) in combination with various NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash was usually slightly up to moderate, erythematic or makuloid nature, with or without cheeses and occurred normally during the second treatment week and disappeared within two weeks, without having to cancel the treatment with Amendavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrosis cases were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV-disease or long-term application of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In case of HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral response (ART) can develop an anti-inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunist infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenase twice a day and were observed twice daily (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory modifications (degree 2 to 4) and laboratory modifications (grade 3 and 4), who received cases with low dose of triglyceride and CPK values, who received Agenase with low dosiphonavir patients.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose the patient is restricted to signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amendavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the processibility of viral and Gag-polarity with the result of a formation of unrafer, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amendavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both an acute and chronic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood parts.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) of Amendavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relation between the activity of Amendavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication during human being is not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral patients with the currently approved Fosamorphavir / Ritonavir doses have been used, as with other knights or clinical treatment methods - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg Fosamorphavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, with 14 isolates genotypical examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the Isolate of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance samples which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosambusavir twice daily: n = 107) patients were treated with protease of patients who were treated with virologically over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitor-mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistance tests, Genotypic interpretations can be applied to estimate the activity of Amendavir / Ritonavir or Fosamorphr / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, M36V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenomenal resistance to Fosambusavir with reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutation or mutations can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to take care of the current interpretations for analysis of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on pherotypic resistance analyses, phenotypic interpretations can be applied in conjunction with genotypical data to estimate the activity of Amendavir / Ritonavir or Fosamorphr / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Firms that distribute diagnostic tests, clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity against Amendavir associated genetic pattern generates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity against indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir however still remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data available to cross-resistant resistance between Amendavir and other protease holders for all 4 Fosamorphavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients (three of 25 Isolate), indinavir / Ritcavir (three of 25 Isolate), Lopinviolr / Ritcavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritcavir (three out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amendavir defies its activity against some other protease inhibitor, Isolate in; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders, which can act on the subsequent treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritcavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized adult (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidental (NRTI) or standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest snorkavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore and sixty (n = 163) patients with untreated virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis provided the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI-group in case of the SOC-PI-group (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma under 16 weeks in plasma, with an non-refractive shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The receipt of the efficacy of ingenoosterly Agenase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Agenase solution was administered three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of kavirus gave at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI was at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs associated with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amendavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) administered together with Amendavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Amendavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amendavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) has remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake does not affect the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approx. 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and lets it close to a large distribution volume as well as unloaded penetration of Amendavir from the blood circulation in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the concentration of the substance in plasma, with the amount of unlimited Amendavir which represents the active part remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unlimited Amendavir remains maintained, the percentage of free active parts during the dosages of the tube in the Steady State is about the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that represent CYP3A4 or inhibits or inhibits or substrate of CYP3A4 should be given with caution when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amendavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amendavir is made of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenase Solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a milliard base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a kidney function is likely to be low on the elimination of Amendavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schematics lead to Amendavir plasma screens, comparable to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amendavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for the canopy with Amendavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benevolne hepatocellular Adenomas with doses of the 2.0 times (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to people, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Amendavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular Adenomas and Karzinome has not been clarified and the relevance of this observable effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of this findings were obtained from the present exposure data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivoc and in-vitro fertilisation tests, the bacterial mutation tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphoma test, micro-core test in rats and chromosome derivation on human peripheral lymphocytes was Amendavir neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical daily life by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, clinical studies have not observed any significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of Agenase, after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies have been treated with toxicity at juvenate, treated with an age of 4 days, both showed an high mortality rates when treated with Amendavir treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasma exposure that was significantly higher (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic doses in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thyotongation and slight skeletal changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules are applied without the increased amount of knights (Booy), higher doses have to be applied to Agenase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20mg of Amendavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amendavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use of patients with weak or light liver abuse with caution, in patients with severe liver function disorder it is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drug, the serious or life threatening side effects can cause such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenottoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under monitoring the International standardization ratio), methods used to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenase should be set on a length of 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with medication-dependent factors such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% reduction in AUC of Amendavir which can lead to a virological reasoning and lead to resistance development.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amendavir in plasma, which were achieved with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amendavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg kavirus.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosing preparation for the simultaneous administration of Amendavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to be a tight monitoring due to the effectiveness and inconcession of this combination.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirz in combination with Amendavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these medicines are applied together, be careful; a thorough clinical and virological monitor should be made, as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Amendavir and Ritonavir is difficult to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons, at least half of the recommended dose may be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data in this case.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentration of calcium blockers such as Amlodipin, dicular pin, divisible pin, Nicodidipin, Nickdipin, Niodidipin, Niodidipin and Verapamil can be increased by Amendavir, which may possibly increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study conducted in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day, along with 50 µg of fluoromppionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous Cortisol increased by approximately 86% (90% interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">At the same time gift of warfarin or other ortic anticoagulsions together with Agenase, an increased control of INR (International standardization ratio) is advised due to the possibility of weakening or amplification of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2083">In case of an overdose the patient is restricted to signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amendavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both an acute and chronic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood racytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) of Amendavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0,50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa, Amendavir defies its activity against some other protease inhibitor, Isolate in; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance to isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the therapy optimisation should be considered to be evaluated using PI pre-treated children of "unborn" Agenase. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unlimited Amendavir remains maintained, the percentage of free active parts within the metering concentration in the Steady State is within the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss..</seg>

<seg id="2218">In clinical studies for the investigation of the application of Imiquimodine for the treatment of the actinic keratosis, Alopezie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental record of 200 mg Imiquimodine which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious adverse effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia that normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">According to the topical use of Imiquimodine increasing systemic concentrations of the alphabet and other cytokine were detected after the topical use of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal studies, 3 efficacy studies were shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete failure of the cowortions during an Imiquimodine treatment has been superior to a placebo-treatment for over 16 weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these trials (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three-week weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest pharmaceutical concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in applying in a vision (12.5 mg, 1 lent bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-time period was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systematic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine was low in patients at the age of 6-12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superfiicide basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to paint the toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG had a significantly lower body weight and increased mitz weight; a tested study for four months resulted in the mouse no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity at mice had no tumors on the application for three days per week.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from human skin and has not mutagen is a risk to see people based on systemic exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were treated in the group of mice that were treated with the acting-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the medicine was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured (as regards its effect in terms of reduction in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme livened the Gag concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the children treated by the end of the study showed a normal large liver.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Althirsty azme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthromby (articulars), pains, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and shooters.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used strongly in patients who may react strongly (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other ingredients (anaphylactic reaction), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">According to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) every year, every year, all new information that may be known and possibly update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who receive alumazyme as regards the response to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission provided an authorization to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. an authorization to the placing on the placing of Aldurazyme in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using the use of Cho-Mammalogy cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative Therapy therapy for patients with secure diagnosis of a Muesysaccharides I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with althirsty hyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of althirsty hyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with aldurst patients can develop infusion reactions, which are defined as any adverse events which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion of infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be monitored continuously, and infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made in a reasonable clinical environment, in which revitalizing conditions for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect nearly all patients of IgG antibodies to Laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment start.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion reaction must be treated with caution of alkalazyme with caution (see section 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since little experience in terms of recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, risk provisioning must be careful retreated according to the theoretically increased risk-reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or anti-pyrotka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a light or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be wodden and / or a reduction of infusion rate on the half of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are lowered, a treatment with anti-histamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is considering.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be restarted with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate when the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / iris and / or Corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme shouldn't be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular intake of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not allow for direct or indirect harmful impact on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is exposed to newborns, exposed to Laronidase over the breast milk, it is recommended to satisfy while the treatment with althirsty azme is not to satisfy.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were prescribed predominantly in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable medicines in connection with althirsty hyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and the extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years, are very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation in the upper respiratory tract and lungs, severe reactions came out, including bronze, respiratory failure and facial expressions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, who during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years, with predominantly severe expirform and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, have been reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconjolation, with patients aged under 5 years old and patients with a severe concurrent form (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the phase 3 study (or up to an early retirement from the study) were found no antibodies in 13 / 45 patients with radioimmunopreparation (RIP) Assay, among them 3 patients who have never been to Seroconia.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a failure to a low-antibody mirror showed a robust reduction in the urine mirror in Harn, while patients with high antibody titres was a variable reduction of gag to be found in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in Phase 2 study) showed an marginally up to low-neutral effect on the enigmatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to impose clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies could not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse drug reaction, even if the occurrence of unwanted pharmacies typically fell in combination with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and the preventing of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is removed quickly from circulation and cells into the lysosomes, most likely on man-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomized in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were randomized by the average phenotype and only one patient had the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an ongoing expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week (182 weeks) every week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurst patients had an improvement of lung function and the ability to take on the table in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintain this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurst group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period of clinically and the absolute lung-volumes increased steadily over to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomic result of treatment reached 22 (85%) by the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">During the first 4 weeks there was a clear blow of the gag-mirror in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease among patients treated by using a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes in the six-minute approach, movement of the shoulder-gelding Ahi and visual acuity, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe computform).</seg>
<seg id="2328">For four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg over the last 26 weeks due to elevated GAG- mirrors in the Harn in Week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) has been determined according to the Z Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium-run form showed a normal spiritual development rate, whereas in the older patients with heavier expiration form or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, examinations were carried out in a phase-dynamic effects of various alkalinity metering schemata on the gag-mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent the difficulties with weekly Infusions, a justifiable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two metering schematics is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available every year, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those with older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions one day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed gift as well as the day after the treatment a corticosteroid must be given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetreproof, at least 5 cans of folic acid must be taken and the ingestion must be continued during the whole duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive a intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetremixed dose, and after every third control cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrxed, a complete blood of blood was created before each gift - including a differentiation of the Leukocytes and a Thrombozyn census.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose test must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle, taking place under the evaluation of the Nadirs of the blood of blood or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indicators in tables 1, 2 and 3 for ALIMTA as a Monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxdes Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients are non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted if in patients after 2 dose inductances a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 occurs or so- continued at level 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or above, compared to patients at age 65 years an increased secondary school has been increased.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended to use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data to unthinkable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a cancer immunance of ≥ 45 ml / min, no dose adaptions is necessary to go out for all patients recommended dose adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a Kreatinine Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not enough; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; to the 1.5-fold of the upper limit value (in abuity of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not included in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in terms of the bone margins, and Pemetreproof may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutron number reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- Cycles once again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrores, Thrombocytends and maximum non-hematological toxicity, as observed in previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 hematological toxicity such as Neutropenia, febrile neutrogany and infection with Degreg 3 / 4 neutrogany, observed, if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be treated with Pemetretreated patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic measure to reduce treatment toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous insteroid drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimizing (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are provided for therapy with psemetreproof, the intake of NSAIDs must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred, corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration ation, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid, collection in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effected in front of the Pemetremixed treatment should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovous events were reported in clinical trials with psemetremixed occasionally, if this ingredient was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life density (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contra-indicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since there is the possibility of irreversible skircular to reproductive medicine, men should be pointed out in front of the treatment - Ginn insisted on advice regarding the handling.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroid drugs (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to a reduced Pemetre-separation with a result of increased adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, be careful when patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen (Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicyleic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and minimisation, 2 days after the therapy with Pemetreproof avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the Intershareholders with NSAIDs with long half-time like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of interest status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulsions and antineoplastic chemotherapy, requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International standardization ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulsions.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data to use of Pemetremixed with pregnant women, but as at ande- ren Antimetabolites are expected in pregnancy in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetreproof may not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful subsistition of the usement for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since there is the possibility of irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity by Pemetreproof, men should be pointed before the treatment starts to obtain advice regarding the handling of the lock.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who have been alli and no weight loss after 12 weeks should apply to their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can not dismantle some fats in the food, thus about a quarter of the fats that suffer from food to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study in 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 was compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients treated with an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient's relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily stains at the After, Flatus (winds) with stub, chair, fetal / oily chair (drums), Flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be applied to patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organs in transplantation) or drugs like Warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Furthermore, it may not be applied to patients who are absorbed in a long-term malabsorptive syndrome (where sufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract) or to choly (one liver disease), and with pregnant or breastfeeding hats.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited approval for placing on the placing on Orlistat GSK throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body-measure BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypothetical, fetal-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli cannot be applied to children and adolescents under the age of 18 because there are not enough data available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimal, it is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adapting the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Overensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients (see section 4.5) • chronic malabsorptive syndrome • Cholestase • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • persistent treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulsions (see section 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of getting gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a low-fat individual meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes is controlled with an improved metabolic control, patients should consult a drug against diabetes before the beginning of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmacist, because the dose of the antidiabetic effects must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who possess alli as well as medicines at hypertension or higher cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to prevent additional varied measures to prevent any interruption of contractions in the event of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study at the drug interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Applying Warfarin or other oral anticoagulsions in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients receiving clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of one lump dose Amiodaron was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received Orlistat, a slight decrease in the Amiodaron plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and hang together with the pharmacological effect of the medication, as the absorption of single fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials involving orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and generally accepted slightly and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The most common things are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency on the basis of the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of the most known side effects, which were detected after the launch of Orlistat, is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population unwidened shape.</seg>
<seg id="2531">+ It is plausible that treatment with alli to conversion in terms of potential and actual gastrointestinal side effects can result.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Individual doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple outlets of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight subjects, without significant clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdose were reported either side effects or similar effects, as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on examinations on humans and animal can be assumed from a rapid recovery of systemic effects that are attributed to the passible characteristics of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect lies at the lumens of the gastric and the upper thin-intestine binding to the active servo-rest of the gastric and pancreatic lipase.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies were derived from clinical trials that 60 mg Orlistat, taken three times daily, blocked absorption of approximately 25% of the food-fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 underlines the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times daily in combination with a hypothetical, fetal-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the baseline value (at the time of Randomization), was evaluated as follows: as change of body weight in the course of course (Table 1) and as part of those participants who lost more than 5% and more than 10% of its initial balance (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (output value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change of the LDL Cholesterins was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">With waist circumference, the average change amounted to -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentration of non-metallized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, sensorised orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without indication of a Kumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients who were administered to the minimal systemically resorated dose, M1 (in position 4 hydrolysisted Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after deformation of the N-Formyl-Leucine group), identified almost 42% of the total surface concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies of safety spliology, toxicity in repeated gift, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproduction, the preclinical data can be detected no particular danger for human beings.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied for chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin), and in case of chemical therapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting are (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be created by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (an pharmaceuticals, which can be used as antiemetical).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended to be submitted to the effects in this age group not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient reduces the binding of one chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi has been studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemical therapies, which are strong or moderate triggering for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In case of chemical therapies a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223) compared to 57% of those treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In case of chemical therapies, the moderate triggering for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 from 189) compared to 69% of those treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolassetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission provided an authorization for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute symptoms and vomiting in strongly embodily chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderate-etoed chemotherapy due to a cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a heavily emetogenic chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding one before the Corticosteroids created by chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon strike, patients should be monitored by anamnestling care or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, be careful with the same time gift of Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or they tend to an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Unless in connection with another chemotherapeutic drug, Aloxi should not be used for prevention of nausea and vomiting in the days after receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preoperative studies, Palonosetron was not inhibiting on the tumor activity of the five investigated chemotherapists (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady static concentration of Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokic analysis showed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiodaron, Celectrotine, Cimetidine, Cimetidine, Cimetidine, Paroxetine, Ranidine, Rtralin and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies do not lie before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women, unless it be considered necessary by the treated doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) that were at least possibly associated with aloxi, headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive actions and reactions to the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies showed unwanted events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of effect to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies, due to the distribution volume, a dialysis is believed to be no effective treatment in a Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Cylinorron (half-time 7.3 hours) received intravenously to day 1 without Dexamethasron.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, a total of 667 patients showed a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, as well as 250 mg / m2 Cycloosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg of Ondansetron who were intravenously given day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-related chemotherapy and the study with strongly emailing chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolassetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical trials, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the Ionic and Repolarisation involved in ventriculars and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study performed at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EKG effects of I.V. cabin in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows a slow elimination of plasma concentration as a slow elimination out of the body with an average terminale half of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg with healthy and cancer patients dosing proportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous gift of Palonosetron, 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured at 11 Hodenkarcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in Palonosetron-plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">The calculated value of 0.25 mg. of Palonosetron was calculated from pharmacokane simulations on 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), which was measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax after the one lump was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% have been eliminated via the kidneys and about a further 50% are converted into two primary metabolic rollers, which are in comparison to Palonosetron by less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lower degree, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 is involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found around 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchangeable, made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-time intravenous injection, the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function disturbing the terminal exposure time and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron, a reduction of the dose is therefore non-justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of the clinical studies revealed evidence that Palonosetron can block up only into very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular Dee- and Repolarisation and prolong the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose escapes in about 30 fold of the therapeutic of people) that were given every day over two years, led to an incidence of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, epidiermark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known but due to the used high doses and because Aloxi is appointed for one-time use, the relevance of these results is low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was supposed to be a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same arzasty, which was already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Card").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alphoneon was to be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-haly) hepatitis C (one through a virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In case of a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue decreased, in addition, the values of the liver enzymes and alaminotransferase (ALT) are raised in the blood flow.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was produced, stimulating the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon made data to prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition, and purity of the medicine), action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C (hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference rate to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been excreed that the data on the stability of the substance and the market of market should not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to the treatment of Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease was reignant in more patients than at the reference account; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test was used to investigate the question, to what extent the drug forms a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be applied to the treatment of impetigo (one with cruelaborated skin infection) and small infected infirmations (Riss- or chids), cut-out and wound up wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altarmades should not be used for the treatment of infections which were proven to be caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because alarm can not affect these type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altarrests can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not be applied for treated skin surface than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine patients and evaluate alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts through blockage of the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was denied by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under altarcheon and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin hours, altargo and Cefalexin were similar to contact: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin hours, approximately 90% of patients with both groups spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, it was noted that the altargo was caused by the treatment of abscesses (exerted cavities in the body tissue) or of infections which were proven to be caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with altarrests (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an appeal to the Contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of altarf at the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections weigh over the risks: • Impetigo, uninfected small killings, coating or paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for placing on altarys in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvement occurred within two to three days, an alternative therapy should be evaluated and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or heavy local irritation by the use of Retapamulin for treatment, the treatment is canceled and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen, or is assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary-infected wounds the efficacy of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections which were caused by a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered as if after a 2-3-day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapopulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma concentration, which were achieved when people were subjected to topical skin, or infected high-surface wounds, a clinically important inhibitor in vivo should not be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day, 200 mg of Ketoconazol increased the medium retapopulin at AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin at the diced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure of topical use in patients, dose adaptations will not be required if topical retapers can be applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive response to oral ingestion and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and the fötal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapopulin should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the use of Retapamulin is to provide the gift of a systemic antibiotic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2696">At the decision whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with altargo should be completed / terminated, is between the benefit of the breastfeeding of the infant and the benefit of the altarpiece therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the altargo was applied, the most common adverse event of the meeting occurred, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of effect is a semi-synthetic Derivat by Pandromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthetics by interaction with a particular binding set of the 50s subunit of the bacterial rift which differs from the engagement of other ribosomal interagic antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the engagement stelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the peptidyltransferred centre centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binding inhibit Pandromutiline the peptidylisation, block some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active post ribosomes subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Based on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Retapamulin at least some infectious forms, a consultation should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulate is sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a failure to the treatment of S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily with occlusion and put on the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma proteins were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the mediation and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) is 660 times lower than the IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism in vitro oxidative Metabolism in human liver microsomes was given primarily by CYP3A4, under small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro studies on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test and in cultures of human blood-hocytes and in rats-microcore test to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male or female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure as the highest exposure of exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2)</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats were diagnosed in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development tools (reduced weight) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the approval for placing an application must ensure that a pharmaceutical-vigilance system, such as will be present in the 1.8.1 version of the application process, and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorisation is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical-vigilance activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Crossine on Risk Management System for the Linal Products for human use, the updated RMP is to be submitted to the next periodic safety update.</seg>
<seg id="2717">In case of irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place, you should finish the application of altarf and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Don't apply any other ointments, creams or levelons on the surface, which is treated with altargo when it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient temperature is applied for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be applied within one of two doses of existing vaccination plan, where a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if during the immunisation there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccination will run from two doses to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a donor dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, ambient temperature or other hepatitis C or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines works as opposed to the immune system (the natural origin of the body), "how it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and created antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix adults, which has been approved since 1997, has been approved by Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within one of three doses of existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also referred to as receipt for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient concentrations carried out between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix at a six-month period and at a 12-month interval between injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, pain at the injection site, redness, merit (tiredness) as well as friction.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient temperature may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biological s.a. an authorization to the placing of the ambient of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for Grundig munisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a cartridge is requested for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, may be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalers vaccines or combined with a combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B- surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed in the same order as after vaccination with the relevant monovalers vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immune competent individuals who are demanded on an hepatitis A- Impact, since they may be protected from immune memory when they are no longer proven.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injectors should be available in the rare case of a aphylactic reaction according to the gift of the vaccine production, appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring must be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is advised with the combination simple, the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients with disturbances of the immune system, after basic dimmers under the circumstances, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies can be reached, so in these cases the gift of other vaccine doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraocular injection or intramuscular administration is to lead to an optimal Impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombocytopenia or blood coagulation disorders, Ambirix may be injected as an exception as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift to blood.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambient temperature was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus-, azellular and Haemophilus, type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masculum mumps which was administered, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunotherapy or patients with immune defects, it may not be possible to achieve adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, curroenteritis, headache, and fever comparably with the frequency that was observed with the earlier thiomerisation and preservative vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccination of Ambirix were given at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the tolerability of ambient sounds were compared with the combination of the 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and piety at a calculation basis per vaccination dose of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 57% of subjects, compared to 39.1% involving the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received the ambient temperature was more pain, compared with 63.8% involving the subjects who have been vaccinated with the 3-dose content.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matism was comparable high (i.e. over the whole vaccines received at 39,6% of the subjects who were at ambient times compared to 36,2% of the subjects who received the 3-doses combined).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturing was low, comparable to that, after administration of the combination, it was observed with the 3-cans vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- until 11-year-old vaccines the appearance of local reactions and generalizations in the ambient temperature was comparable to that observed with the 3-cans-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, in the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with ambient temperature, a Frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not reported per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines, which were more serious side effects during the 2-cans-vaccas with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B and surface antigen, was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years were the seroconversions for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6, requested dosage (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6, the dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was conducted at 12- to and including 15-year-olds received 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With the 289 people whose immunity was worthless, the seroprotome rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose strains.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- and 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-cans-vaccschema with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were at the time of basic dimming between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immunisation with ambient temperature and ambient temperature in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction to both antigens was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simple, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of recombined hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to and including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be compared to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix, tetanus-, azellular Pertussis, inactivated Poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus, type b-vaccination (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine was administered, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotator and seroconverting rates such as for earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles available.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have become known since the division of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP represented the opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for ambient temperature is positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">As Ambirix was only brought to traffic in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited to the low patient area.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonium can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with incomplete enzyme, or with hyperammonium concentration as a result of high ammonium concentration) in the foresight.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonite is - split by several single boxes to the meals, mixed with food or via a Gastroomieschlder (through the abdominal wall in the stomach of the tube) or a nose probe (the nose is used in the stomach of the tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonites cannot be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo agent, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonium can also result in Apprence loss, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, resistance, liquid retention, taste problems or taste, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammonium in patients with disruptions of the urine cycle to high ammonium values can be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonium has been approved under "exceptional circumstances, as due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug are templates.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients, where a complete enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-fixed form (incomplete enzyme, which manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication of the use when in the anamese a hyperammonium encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with canyal troubles, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated under consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginthrift in patients with an early lack of carbamylamide or ornithintranny bamylase is required to be administered in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine inine deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as a risk for the emergence of ecophagusulcera is, if the tablets do not reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and ecumenical clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolization and the expression of sodium phenylbutyrat above the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS in the pregnancy is therefore contra-indicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous gifts of phenylacacetate at young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neurons and caused by a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerves in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacacetate should be excreted by humans in breast milk, and that reason why the use of AMMONAPS is contra-indicated during the breastfeeding time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and at 78% of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old female patient who developed an metabolic opathy in combination with lactic converter, heavy hypokalemia, tanks and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of an overdose occurred within a 5 month old small child with a random single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacacetate, which showed an intravenous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacist is a metabolic active connection, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Acetylometrically seen in urea with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the separation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urine cycle can be assumed to be produced for every gram of bias sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started to improve the chances of survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptom form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infectious and the disease did even lead to death with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickless analogy within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen dioxide (sodium phenylate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacist, sodium benzoate and residual substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn before postpartal (but within the first month of life) diagnosed to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonium encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients suffering from many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-fixed form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotes form of the ornithintranny bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonium encephalopathy and treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protrual diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also very reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyat in tray form, 15 minutes after intake measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary bladder dysfunction or hemoglobin opathies, after different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no Phenylacacetate in plasma was detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis, which were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylating concentration in plasma concentration on the third day were five times higher than according to the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Differentiation The drug is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjusted phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had been treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken as oral (babies and children who can still swallow no tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a Gastroomieschlouse or an Nasensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protesters should be kept in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginthrift in patients with an early lack of carbamylamide or ornithintranny bamylase is required to be administered in a dose of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat oils were exposed before the birth of phenylacacetate (active metaboite of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the Hirnrind.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old female patient who developed an metabolic opathy in combination with lactic converter, heavy hypokalemia, tanks and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Acetylometrically seen in urea with urea (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the exhumiliation of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on examinations concerning the separation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions of the urine cycle, sodium polyphenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0,15 g of phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are also very reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological state can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyat in granular form, 15 minutes after the intake measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the completed product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this purpose, the small measuring scoop 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g of sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication at a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they can accumulate the sticketed waste products, which can accumulate after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you have conducted laboratory studies, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacist, if you take other medicines or recently taken recently, even if it is not prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During feeding times, you can't take AMMONAPS because it could go over to the mother's milk and harm to your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, turbulence, headache, taste problems, deceit, rectibility, memory disturbance and worsening of existing neurological states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice one of these symptoms at yourself, place your doctor immediately with your doctor, or with the recovery of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronaranties" (ACS, reduced blood sugar to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest cork with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebdo" (an abnormal measuring value of the electrocardiac disease or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered, and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with angina or heart attack to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS unit, where the effect of angiox on a couple of gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulary) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short tubes which remains in the artery to prevent a clasp), and they also received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">At the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in case of preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year, as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI was Angioxin relation to all the indicators equally effective as Heparin, except for serious bleeding, where it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other stags, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Moreover, it is not allowed to be applied to patients who recently had an bleeding, as well as people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came in due to the conclusion that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. an approval for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronaranties (instabile Angina / non-ST-Hebrides) in case of emergency relief (IA / NSTEMI)) or if necessary, early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous membrane of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another sequence a PCI should be given an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the use of clinical trials, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An accumulation of 0.5 mg / kg may be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhinoplasty.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI surgery is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to 225 seconds, a second layer should be charged at 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before applying and the bolt dose rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, additional monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restrictions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (if using bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second layer dose of 0.3 mg / kg is required, and the ACT 5 minutes after the second breastplate again test again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damages, which were included in phase III- PCI study (replace), the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adaption at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe rendering damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox may be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous gift of unfractionated Heparin or 8 hours after the completion of the subcutaneous gift of low-molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other parts or against cerudine • active bleeding or increased blood disorders due to a disturbance of hemoggling system and / or irreversible effects of hypertension. • severe kidney damages (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully developed during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood supply, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulary (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if a PCI-patient under bivalirudin occur in most of the bleeding in arterial points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment of basically any bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who take Warfarin and treated with bivalirons, a monitoring of the INR value (International normalised ratio) should be ensured to ensure that the value after separation of treatment with bivalirudin was reached again before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge about the mode of action of anticoagulancies (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombocytenant), it can be assumed that these substances are increasing the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with throcytes aggregationers or anticoagulsions, clinical and biological hemoglobsters are regularly to control in any event.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are insufficient in terms of impact on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, inadequate or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomly assigned to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomly assigned to either infractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivaliryin Group as well as in patients treated with Heparin treated comparative groups were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding as defined in Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding came to significantly less than in groups of haparin plus GPIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY has been defined as one of the following events: intraial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemoglobin at the point of point, reduction in hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known blood supply, Reoperation due to an bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood locationations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point points, gastrointestinal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following statements about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study involving bivalirudin in 6,000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliryin Group as well as in patients treated with Heparin treated comparative groups were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients over 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding came to significantly less than in the reference group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above have been reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately torn down and the patient is close to evidence of a blood circulation.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinder, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as to the anthrombin region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in a liquid phase or tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirons in Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin moves slowly up the binding of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, which means that the functioning of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, by bivalirudin with serum of patients who had come in the past to heel-induced thropocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), there were no throcytes aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients bivalirudin demonstrated a dosing and concentration of anticoagulatory effect, which is governed by ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed below a PCI, an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of ACUITY trial, Heparin or Enoxaparin has been administered to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, who need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra (under the skin) is injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh, or the upper arm or infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to the regulation of glucose (sugar) in the blood or that insulin can not be processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin is very slight from humanities, and the change signifies that it acts quicker than a short period of activity than a short-term humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a durable insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes where insulin is not effective, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glycemic hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% was reduced from 7.60% to 7.46% compared to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin-lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra, compared to 0.30% of the normal normal temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra can not be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) to insulin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering an hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra may be adapted if it is administered together with a range of other medicines that can effect on the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission presented Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, an authorization to the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection using either in the abdominal wall, thigh or the Deltamuskels, or subcutaneous coaches through continuous infusion into the area of abdominal cord.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin resistance, the insulin need may be lower in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Each change of the efficiency level, the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkoff, etc.), the species of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can attract a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or dosing of a treatment, in particular in patients with a insulin requiring diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic converter; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under severe medical supervision and may require a change to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of an hypoglycaemia depends on the active effect of the used insulin profile and can therefore change from the treatment of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that enhance blood glucose levels and enhance the inclination to hypoglycades, opgiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, oxidoxetin, monoxide oxide, propoxylic, rophenylate and sulphuramide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathizolytics such as stables, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenerable headland weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive studies showed no differences between insuprematism and human-insulin regarding the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether the insulin delivery occurs in the human mother's milk, but in general, insulin occurs neither into the breast milk, nor is it resorised according to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the clinical trials identified, grouped according to system organs and ordered after decreasing frequency of their upgrades (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of the existing templates).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is refuted to change the injection site within the injection site, can occur in the aftermath of a lipodystrophide at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycerides with consciousness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriated person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose agitation, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Gaal of insulin is performed faster and the operation time is shorter than at hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-lisin showed a proportional effect of gluing effect, and at 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in gluing effect, exactly as human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin shulisin has a twice as fast active effect as normal human-insulin and achieves the complete motion-energy effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable postdenial glycaemic control, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">In 2 minutes before the meal, iseclulisin was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal, was given a better postdenial control than with humanized Normal-insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is gearing in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is given as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the beginning of a meal (Figure 1A) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as in comparison to human normal levels, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before a meal) (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - downwards) after the beginning of a meal in comparison to human Nor- painters, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
