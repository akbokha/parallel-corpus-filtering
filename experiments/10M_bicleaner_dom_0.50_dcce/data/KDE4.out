the package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by providing this easier .
more information about the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to upload these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; download the extensions simultaneously .... Open the ticket card tools and select there the required modules .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package that contains &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; you can view the page , or the list of stor@@ my , if present .
the module filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras ad filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current work directory on different types .
to view the DO@@ M building view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use the DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M is the right displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root display of the document , for example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root no@@ des .
the module &amp; conditions view ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type I@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text messages to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; it is to portra@@ yed with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . Tree @-@ Maps allows the display of the size of objects in broken structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size doesn &apos;t have to have the capacity of the lower objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
near &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . according to this way , large files can be easily detected even if they are seen far below in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; fs@@ view ; as an interactive and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX , command you can be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap @-@ representation a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles meaning@@ ful color and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on colour mode , can be either a depth for the light detection of the dis@@ closures or the figure of another file system such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the various qualities of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature you can determine if sufficient space is to be used or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates are to be used ( where to act bo@@ wel error by constra@@ ints during the sign of tre@@ em@@ ap ) . in addition , you can define the relative position of the lab@@ eling in rect@@ angle .
with intest@@ inal algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , this target should not always be met . during the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; fs@@ view , this goal is not always met . it will be drawn in order to enter the subject of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
as a result of the area of a single entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ates , the implementation will be left up . here it is intended for the reproduction and avoid@@ ance of space losses due to the frame that the tan@@ gles are created , the best methods of that are classified as possible . the best methods on this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive .
you can define the minimal amount of space for an entry on the menu entry . instead , a ro@@ unding pattern is drawn into the area of the higher part , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under@@ cut entry .
originally , &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ g@@ utter .

&amp; digi@@ plug , contains a fast image processing with basic editing tools . you can use these to view your photographs , comment , evaluate , and correct . the working skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug@@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ plug has come ; it is easy to use , it offers dozens of professional abilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the shell conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC @-@ color degra@@ dation work@@ flow .
improved database with significantly more metad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or lens that can be sought .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means , it is on the support of the En@@ dan@@ ese government . you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; tries to make the signal from problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible . if you use these links , your web browser opens one page in error correction system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to retri@@ eve your review .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; is a project which is supported by a community . if you come to join a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug , then we would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ plug . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be mentioned in English , you should be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ ders ; homepage to visit the news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous ; find out .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ plug , is the registration in the developers @-@ ma@@ iling list . guidance to contact in the developers @-@ ma@@ iling list of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
when you start &amp; finish , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote file . just enter a name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data transfer is stored . this path remains the same for all image sc@@ anners .
later you can add a lot of folders such as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug , you will also use as an al@@ um@@ library . digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains pictures , as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ plug , consider any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator as shown in the folder :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; dur@@ st re@@ b@@ ates the libr@@ arians in its entire depth . you can &apos;t shut down your sub@@ folder , unless it comes in hidden folder . this can you get extraordinary &amp; digi@@ ous folder ; get rid of a point before the name of the folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List can &apos;t take photos as symbols . you can change them by taking a popular photo taken from the album and then use it on the folder icon . this will then be used as a Alb@@ um@@ icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera ; then you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ tel@@ et to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ vers : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can take it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help of Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support .
you can set up this and work with raw files in sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug . more than 1000 digital cameras can be downloaded through the library g@@ phot@@ o@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system ; work together with &amp; digi@@ plug .
modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory card and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be implemented as a record transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug , uses the program g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 to communication with digital camera . g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 is also a free @-@ free software collection for digital cameras , which was developed constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 supports the transfer of pictures of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for your communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in generally large files are out@@ dated and transfers over the serial port is slow , this connection is supported and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ phot@@ o@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read reviews . if the card support is not present in lib@@ g@@ phot@@ o@@ 2 , you may have pre@@ dic@@ tive images that might be impossible or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ in interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; accessories . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can be manipul@@ ated by almost any way as it can also be a user . her benefit is that it was much easier to complete &amp; digi@@ plug through the writing of a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug .

if you select a month from the list , select all photos of this month in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date of the file , so you can only display the photos of the selected days .
photos with key@@ word provide a flexible and powerful option available to organize and catalog@@ ues . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or all groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found in the selection of this key@@ word or search .
when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been selected with this key@@ word will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . by this , you can log into your key@@ word . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , which you are looking for , easy to find .
the key words are saved in a database for quick access and access key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also re @-@ imported your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords will be re @-@ imported into the loss of the database as soon as &amp; digi@@ plug .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an exist@@ ential key@@ word , and then add a new key@@ word , after you click on an existing word , this will become the sub@@ title of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a key@@ word , the photograph is not deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then a menu that gives you the key@@ word to slide . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the characteristics of a sample by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the text word in the key@@ word . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ;

what is a digital inventory - descending from the fashion word ? digital inventory management sees any part of the process after the picture has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos will receive , sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your images , use and use photos . we look at downloading , ren@@ ame , convert , convert , evaluate , evaluate , search , wait , wait and export images from image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , seeks , trans@@ forms , trans@@ forms and exported to an mon@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metad@@ ata is defined as data on data . metad@@ ata is provided in accordance with your definition , information about or a documentation of other data to be managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not to find more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you do not use &amp; digi@@ plug guarantees very fast search and secure filing on which you can access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you need any kind of your system is the setup information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos will have to save them on a reser@@ vo@@ ke drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly beyond your location . if you &apos;re doing enough photos , then you will be sign@@ atories such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; can then export a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % job files will not be able to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes the pile processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the metad@@ ata into the file page of metad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ plug . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can then select the metad@@ ata from the database into the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? in addition , the digi@@ ous editor is available for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important .
now the real work begins , since you need to assign to each photo words , labels and an assessment . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute , and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best pictures for further work .
let &apos;s go with keywords , key words , as you are often called on other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import Cat@@ alog@@ ical pictures from another source with embedded en@@ chan@@ ters , then you will paste the images on the right place . the outline of the Hier@@ archy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by adding a sub @-@ tree to another . the modified tags can be followed by &amp; digi@@ ; updated while it pursu@@ es the under@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metad@@ ata is over@@ taken . this is a very rough representative as each block of metad@@ ata is made of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the key words - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool for catalog@@ u@@ ing your metad@@ ata .
most don &apos;t want to let you see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to find your photos arriving .
check out this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it , you begin to see some details , people , the square .
and now I say you this of the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . Wow ! it starts to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . the label has changed your perception of this panorama .
for other photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . when you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him about the motive you move that you understand what you understand .
it &apos;s ok , if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for themselves alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can contact you as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , when you export your pictures in Web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your labels and / or the title of Web @-@ g@@ eri@@ es@@ system . so you do not have to tell the story for a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with light speed .
the possibilities to use Ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alisation are already inn@@ umer@@ able and are able to get deeper into the future . I also am sure that one day , in the near future , you can easily browse your travels with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures at the recording venue . you can also export the pictures at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of removing cop@@ y@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms shall apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information was found in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ; as information is deposited in information :
author ( syn@@ onymous with writer and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it was not desired to protect the name of photograph@@ ers , then the name of a company or organization can be used . after which this value has been saved , it should not be changed . this field does not support coma or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
auto@@ graph ( syn@@ onymous with author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples for this may be the title of a photographer , freelance photographer or more independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ k to the author field , this also must be filled in .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the bi@@ d@@ eter field to identify who offers this photo . if the photographer is working for a News Agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , these organisations can be listed here if the picture is a bearing picture , then the group / agency will offer the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this can do no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator can modify or modify the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for professionals and semi @-@ professionals .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug , in the near future , will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing .
topics : turn@@ outs , plate loss , blackout , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ er@@ pre@@ ventive , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ itions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have lost on the street or a fire . these type of losses are the same that you can also happen in traditional paper pictures or negatives . in this section it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
Kro@@ ell On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these pre@@ ferences must be treated more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . of course , you can claim CDs and DVDs in archi@@ ving quality . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you think that is in your detection area .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording tools and keep them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it turns out to choose the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to error , even if you were just written only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical aging , ultra @-@ violet light , scr@@ at@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a good program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster that seems to make signs of CDs and DVDs . but there is also similar applications available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications which can read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to gain the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device to qualit@@ atively high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . you should also check out the media with a description , date &amp; author characteristics and then on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware and software that can read these media .
dis@@ manufacturers reserve your statistics for themselves . their production guaranteed include a new Disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ missing
shortly : dis@@ cos keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most frequent error rate , SM@@ ART can not determine these errors immediately . some of SM@@ ART demonstrated these errors immediately . these are especially reading bugs and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually come again without great problems .
while most electrical appliances do not make a lot of power , it looks different from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these anom@@ ali@@ es can damage these anom@@ ali@@ es , complete data loss , hard@@ warning and other defects , so protect themselves from the inevitable part of a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage prot@@ ector . this is a device that is absorbed by a part of energy @-@ heat and the rest is gro@@ unded . it is usually in the form of a connector bar . remember that not any plug @-@ in is also included in over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also consider that it protects the protection against ligh@@ tening and protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used on your machine , you should also be sure that all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cables which can also include a telephone connection for your modem . other offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable fashion and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore very small and you can also contain the protection for your modem .
while over@@ voltage prot@@ ector your system will protect your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can be automatically provided with battery power . some models allow you to save your data and run the system . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements such as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifespan of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
remember the potential risk of being exposed to your computer system and compare it with the costs to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think about it all cables before you enter the holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
in comparison to the hard drives , you can cost very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services . your free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional variant provides you more at your disposal , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory that should not be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted in the offer and the large number of companies are included in the offer and they are des@@ iring secure .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are due for transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs provide for at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that you say if a transmission error occurred , not when this is done in your hardware . all these errors stay un@@ discovered until you don &apos;t have any protection against it . no one seems to have thought in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable mains parts are a further source of transmission systems as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data stream . during normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected particularly by trans@@ missions , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two Can@@ did@@ ates that can handle and highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available for this article in English .
Ora@@ cle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at working conditions . with Not@@ eb@@ ooks , the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most mei@@ osis , than for instance , theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less an@@ due for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the spread file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : in@@ correct , only the speed of the examination process for a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and a definite status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat of digital data : wrong , theft and human error , the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundament@@ ally physical limits . it is meant that technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are far from this limit far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more stringent . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk now get out today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone accounting for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are subject to a plan and test this backup before any dangerous like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of panels , or the size change of hard disks .
suppose you have to make your sick@@ le on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you will be lucky when the drive was not connected in the instant .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget about plane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention is still a non @-@ local store . bring your sick@@ le up the stairs into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite f@@ use the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that of one day .
a complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete system and the last differentiation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . it creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at each time . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that is only partly fasting and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool which allows you to easily set up your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer missions Re@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety beyond ss@@ h .
save important pictures right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ t@@ table medium .
this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come to f@@ use with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work@@ files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should have done after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metad@@ ata , copy the images on the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility ... , use of the Internet .
thus valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is not predict@@ able due to your nature , you &apos;ll have to look at it all today . unfortunately , there is no other way to come across as a certain wa@@ el@@ iness . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
Virtu@@ alization is now available for each . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay at open standards .
scal@@ ability is the subject of a system to change a system in its size . this actually means to increase .
let &apos;s assume that you have completed the scal@@ ability with plans and put the area you want to put on a dedicated plate or partition . with * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer to a new board :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / MS@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / MS@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS
open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier for year to year .
G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . so you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard , but it is much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metad@@ ata , but it is a relative number of administration information , but not as many as T@@ IFF requires and a slow compression has . this format will we recommend to store your images .
T@@ IFF was widespread than picture format . T@@ IFF can store in un@@ compressed form or stored in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm . however , it manages images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people . there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed for the need for the need of camera formats . it is now available for a handy camera manufacturers and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , by 2001 , Adobe uses the X@@ MP technology to replace &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic technology that allows users to em@@ bed data into a file . file information are saved with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF .
lots of photograph@@ ers pull it off before an original of your recording , mostly in the shell format . X@@ MP wants to store the metad@@ ata separately from the image file . but it can be found in the link between the metad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and how above already noticeable is the raw format used . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application and business models . to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I , work on architecture and mod@@ elling , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and explan@@ atory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long the pictures are on the camera folder , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert Cop@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for a fine @-@ layer process . if you want to edit the pictures once again with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the metad@@ ata . these were cut off the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , add them to MPEG , using in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description , as you can have photos you already on your hard disk , but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for imp@@ ose images on your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to connect your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect them with the machine , turn the camera to the display mode , and turn it on . another description here you will find in the manual of your camera .
when you launch the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file association for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side@@ bars attributes and metad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of one entry or its metad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information which are internally stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . notice that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the rider metad@@ ata shows the internal metad@@ ata such as ex@@ if , manufacturing , GPS etc. of the image . these information are the same as with the metad@@ ata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug , or image processing . note that these metad@@ ata is not available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single record in &amp; digi@@ plug . in addition , the photos will not be deleted from their camera and we recommend you to check whether the pictures are safe in an album before you delete photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired search methods offered by &amp; k@@ de ; select the button download and then select the chosen folder . the button selection can be downloaded here as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , option New to download is available . these pictures have not been selected by &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in front windows . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
when you can download the buttons all download or searched out , a dialog box will appear in which the photos will be sorted . the list of existing albums will be sorted , how normal folder is sorted , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ o ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all files by clicking the button . if you only want to delete a few , you need to select this manually and delete it afterwards .
please note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be deleted in the tr@@ ash@@ ings of &amp; k@@ de ; you should be carefully insp@@ ect whether the photos were successful into a &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete your camera information , you should make this considerably faster .
cameras use as a file name for photos frequently are not particularly meaning@@ ful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames can usually lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate photos of different recording eries in the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the file was put into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dat@@ or @-@ based sub@@ s@@ lab@@ s . if you use this option , a folder will be created every day .
the options During the broadcast opens three more options that are carried out before the photos stored on the plate . if you choose this , the respective entries will be copied to the author in Section Standard Author@@ ities . with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command string .
if you use the camera file name , you have the opportunity to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in lower case letters , or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ plug , can be used all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of view . not all cameras are ready to perform this information . in section page bar metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information which your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually turned on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , the photograph is in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn@@ around , use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
if your camera has been updated information about the date at which the photo was made , this sub@@ section is based on the image data . all pictures with the same date will be charged in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub @-@ album . in section side bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores can be switched off . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the button Extended and select there the date file @-@ based sub@@ set at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their machine to their camera is the button download . select the file selection dialog &amp; kiss ; appears where you can choose the files that are uploaded . you can also choose more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is done , take &amp; digi@@ ous ; you , where the images are uploaded to your camera . select the folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a common concept in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . identifying the data can be displayed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to combine an image with a precise geographical place . not everyone is using an airplane to carto@@ graphic data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can use one click to open the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , who wants to locate the location of the photos so it &apos;s well to refer to the location data of a photos .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , saddle and card refer@@ encing . it is at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and most of the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera to integrate a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading GPS data from a device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , these data must be saved in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the curtains coupled coordinates , which are created by map@@ s.@@ 1 .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that can access the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug . in order to accept these settings , you must select between these settings . you can change between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
select promotion can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing can be put on embedded preview site . in order to take the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug , click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standard candidate and ur@@ ges legal data . these data will automatically be selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is synchron@@ ized in the IP@@ TC fields during downloading .
auto@@ graph is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should contain the specification of photograph@@ ers . this field is intended to be a photographer , freelance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description on the author field , this should also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if this is registered for a News Agency such as Reuters or Associated Press ; if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency must be listed here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this is done that the metad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug . these metad@@ ata are also available in &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without being lost .
images rendered as embedded label ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this synchron@@ ized the comments you will add to your photos , with the images embedded in the images . this allows you to include labels in pictures , which are already labelling , these are over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ ous images .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window on a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to determine which data types &amp; accessories came to indicate , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove . any file in one &amp; digi@@ b ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which is not any of these extensions , ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button updating a button from each category .
the settings of the illuminated area of &amp; digi@@ plug can be set on this page . however , if you are switched on the illuminated table . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ized mode . if you have one , you should use only quick computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose the tool bar , if you use the tool bar in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colours are set here . in image processing it can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia towards the immediate explanation .
with the P@@ NG device , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality since P@@ NG requires any loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can use this value for a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the T@@ IFF file option , you can activate the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for T@@ IFF pictures . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF file . it has no effect on image quality , as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works loss @-@ free .
with the setting of loss@@ less JP@@ EG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free settings . even if you were written any loss@@ y setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JP@@ EG . as this paragraph , metad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image processing was only a picture @-@ viewer for photos . it is currently developing very fast to create a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
the standard increase is that every green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels of odd lines . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the picture a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 bar@@ red pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white off the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Autom@@ atic paint balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white is not the same . standard is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect to get more details in four steps more details in the top @-@ lights . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ noise , so the parts of your images are displayed , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the top @-@ lights in the settings . the settings now solve some unusual results as it shows the top light in various ro@@ ses . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally not satisfy as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing blue and red shares out of the still no saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how much colour or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can be adjusted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you will probably have to set him anything higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ plug . image processing is made too small for the time to try out the conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ tone algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete picture of the particles , which have many cameras and provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ plug , and D@@ cra@@ w are available on three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it was used as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was used . but it creates color file on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results .
if you know the color of your lenses , you can place the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour ref@@ usal if you are carried out during the shell conversion .
one profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ .@@ There are also information such as color form@@ ations from a color space in the other , so the colors are as exactly as possible .
behaviour Quest@@ ions if a picture is opened in image processing / color module module with raw files .
color profil folder S@@ ing the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / color / or / home / .@@ color / ICC , in which you all save your profiles . &amp; digi@@ plug has examined these folders then during the start .
ICC Pro@@ files you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to leave . everything can be changed to open the raw file later .
the color view is an alternative towards X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturers and model you can fit . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color or Gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have conver@@ sions for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the h@@ ue mapping himself .
there are further options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be done by one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could correct you manually instead of the fl@@ ashing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious that color profile is for them for what is intended for . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the purpose : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images concerned and image processing is supported . many modules support that are written in order to cooperate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you want to use and these will then be charged by &amp; digi@@ plug . these modules appear as new entries in the main window and beyond , you will also find some in the context menu of the login menu .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu on Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found on the K@@ IP@@ I project under h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ti@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the Hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide settings should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjust the time between image outputs , usually it is 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes are switching on or out , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
camera characteristics indicate the list of all supported cameras on the left @-@ hand side . on the right there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly , switched on and in image display mode . you are currently here Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , specify which you can attach your camera .
to connect your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your machine and turn it into the display mode .
pro@@ bi@@ ere you see if &amp; digi@@ plug has come ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any number of options for your camera . this is displayed on the main menu of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
using the confirmation dialog for the de@@ bug@@ ging of &gt; images in the tr@@ ash @-@ tr@@ ash , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ al ; check the recording of a photos in an album . in the par@@ agraphs of a recordings and del@@ e@@ tion of a album , you will find further details .
editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; digi@@ plug ; applied when you use the option changes to the right side bar without feedback . otherwise , you will need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you may also include the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ ous ; at the starting start , it will be accelerated under the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ous ;
the setting is looking for new photos to look for new photos . it pro@@ lon@@ gs the basis of the new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the starting time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; when something from the base folder was deleted , it asks ; ask if it should delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose to custom@@ ize the main window onto your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; accessories , you will find more information about it in this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ plug , contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image processing can be started by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry advertis@@ ements .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug . so , you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set up in the picture processing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the upper edge and including the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions .
the editing features of the image processing changes your photos . however , you will not change the original photo before you save File Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the image file , or use the button The button Rec@@ on@@ ment of the image processing re@@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have in the photo since the last store .
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting the editing or re@@ mod@@ elling , by selecting the editing menu from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the keyboard @-@ shorter , c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse , and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are also restored or restored accordingly .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image , or the entries in the menu file . if you &apos;ve made changes on the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you can also view the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change it in the settings dialog box &amp; digi@@ plug . you can also read this in the settings dialog box dialog . see this section for editing the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print the image in the menu image and get the default &amp; box ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . all image sc@@ issors can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ ous window , the main window has a side bar on the right edge , the important information and promotions for the selected images are available . the same page bar is available without the navigation components , even in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders are clicked on :
multiple clicking on the same tab , the side bar will appear or disappear again in the edges .
in the labelling view , you can enter labels with unlimited size or insert . note the remark below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - Fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling system in other applications , you should be aware of these limitations .
after which you have commented , use either the button user or switch to the next image , the fittings are then saved .
in addition to the application button there is a button . with this , you can read more metad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . but you can also select the metad@@ ata into the files . this will always be carried out if you select a metad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the images .
the section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ rows . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the side bar or using the button bar . in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select these and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field , which follows the scheme in the following table :
the key view shows a search box to the filters of the key@@ word , the key@@ word , and a select box with the previously applied in this &amp; digi@@ plug session .
the key@@ word is adapted dynam@@ ically to the entered search phrase . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom ends is a further relief for the input of key@@ word in a picture series . if you have entered several keywords , these are stored for quick access .

if several pictures are selected in the main view , select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this only applies to the original picture and does not apply to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the page Tool@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords and view@@ points . if in addition , one or more keywords will be used from the right side , only the cut quantity will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also pull out keywords and place . suppose you have several images chosen to put you in key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears where you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were removed with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards a key@@ word from the right j@@ ad to choose from and there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place during each start of the program . you can also be switched on with different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or should be , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is being sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the operator argument is the operator , that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can define an extended search over all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button . the options are as follows :

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I made it mainly to &amp; digi@@ plug ; s concrete implementation was adjusted .
the reason why one is using a color@@ less work@@ flow , the colours of your camera or sc@@ anners will have a predict@@ able deviation from the actually photograph@@ ers or sc@@ anned colors . using a color@@ less work@@ flow , you can gain the colours on your monitor from your camera or sc@@ anners , and those that show you the colors of your digital dark chamber .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know what buttons it must express for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make information on any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , links with deeper information is to make your own inform@@ al decisions you can get the desired results .
if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( please find more information below )
your only other image expend@@ itu@@ res are by e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB of de @-@ facto is .
so if my RGB works so well and that makes life for all so easy , why should one use another color space and make your thoughts about h@@ ack@@ able ng ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ ath@@ ite region , and the colors in the RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour flowers , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s site , and then click on info and then on information About RGB working sp@@ aces .
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work in the RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in a RGB color space or not , you &apos;ll need to calibr@@ ate your monitor . if you are working as a color space of s@@ RGB , then you must use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . do not use it before using a further manual processing .
the norm@@ alize , identical , Autom@@ atically det@@ ri@@ s and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Autom@@ atic correction will try to test the best out of your colours . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled down the Leu@@ st@@ res@@ sources about the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without his color correc@@ ting . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
equal : this method adjusted the ampli@@ fication factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity ranges is as flat as possible . so , almost every hel@@ ical range has the same number of pixels , sometimes it produces gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation which causes a wonder at a picture or destroyed it .
automatic equal : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar area .
contrast enlarge : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of the RGB values of a picture by sliding the lowest and highest values in the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ u@@ st@@ ination of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photographs .
the white wine equ@@ ated by &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white off of a photos .
the tin@@ c@@ ere correction is a bit limited since a colour space is done with 8 @-@ bit per suit . in case you can do so far from the original sign , areas with over@@ exposure time can be carried out , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode so your ways to correct the correction is better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start with the menu input colors white off the image processing .
the window windows can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original sign and the preview of the tool can be adjusted . once you want to see the original language settings , then click on the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow alignment is capable of improving your photos or down di@@ mm@@ ers .
An@@ stat with the above checks are used , you should use the colour @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the image preview to select the color temperature of the white comparison chart . this type will also be set the temperature and green values automatically .
additionally you can set the white off with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure dict@@ ator increases the colours when more than a colour channel of pixel over@@ exposed . the combined result is displayed in white immediately . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons save as and loading precisely this . each setting of the white comparison you have set can then save in a text file and then load again later .
the default settings make all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white comparison . note that also neutral settings will be shown a different photo as your original . if you save them , your original sign will be changed .
you can adjust here the coefficient of coding per colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding needs also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG device .
this tool brings up the same dialog as the processing of car@@ ving images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ pers . a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter of color management .
another important tool is to find sound error in the menu . this tool presents an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously , so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner should always require the same error and you will always require the same correction .
a very powerful opportunity to correct , is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug @-@ effects are four color effects , a solar energy effect , a bicycle effect , a Neon effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar control , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was also a effect of the image . the colored , dark sections protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect easy to adjust .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase creates a neg@@ ativity that is not to create photo paper on photo paper .
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original intensity is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ a ; -@@ Eff@@ ect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a balanced color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . this name is a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrast . the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly satisfied colors are also some photograph@@ ers , especially of which the hardly landscapes is too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shift repet@@ itions . in large images the filter may cut the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not unusual to change the color con@@ tours and the ligh@@ tening of the photos . all your Just@@ ices can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you can make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the easy replacement strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value based on improvement of exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you need only the field of sliding only . exactly the three sli@@ der beneath the Hist@@ o@@ program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , hist@@ ogram , active can@@ als or the selected area . underneath the graph are three sli@@ der into the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator and make sure how the picture changes .
on the right side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview can be updated dynam@@ ically , from the image &apos;s settings . on the left @-@ hand side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be adjusted if the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is illustrated . in images the large areas of a constant color does not domin@@ ate the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic entry is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image , to automatically adjust the input lag of the shade , medium and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for an fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to evaluate the output values . the compression of the output values can be used for example as a background to create while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and loading : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ charged with the g@@ im@@ p level format .
if you use this mode and the three color chains , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and Sundays . click on the preview of the original picture to set the input signal for rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option of over@@ exposure controls controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on display in the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , the half of the original and the target picture is shown . the preview can be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
Modi@@ fied channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols can be changed in order to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the pictures featuring a digital camera , linear mode produces a wide scale . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps in this case .
for example , if you post@@ p@@ one a cran@@ vent@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are correspon@@ d@@ ingly dark with dar@@ ker and dar@@ ker images .
on the preview of the original photos , a red markings can be seen . if you want to change this marking on the section you want to change the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you can created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ charged . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three colour pi@@ cking buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , means and Sundays . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the rotor , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option of over@@ exposure controls controls all colour channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result .
below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white picture that has been corrected in L@@ umin@@ esc@@ ale . Sch@@ atten@@ - and Sundays has been applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug has come ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colour shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu of channel duct in the image processing .
using the channel selection box , you can choose the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash . the top section of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed by comparison on your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram with you indicate the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and building allow you to activate this channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , you can also activate the option mon@@ ochro@@ me , as the channel Mixer is a DAS tool for creating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , takes the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from color duct . colour space consists of small smoking species which looks not at the same place in the color channel . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion , in which you can reduce the colour space first .
save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposure controls controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on display in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel was re@@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capacity . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a step of work , since color images can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of film profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford Restaurant 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all scenic images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange @-@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this is improved landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange @-@ filtered .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lenti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ ist effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ atic light to day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lenti@@ l filter . this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : this creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a little bit of cold in the shadow of water . this is typical for the process of reconciliation of prints and re@@ development in a se@@ p@@ case . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
cover with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture on your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry is used for image texture .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the note of the depth or three dimensional ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photograph below . the original version is ( 1 ) and the changed below ( 2 ) . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the borders of a stop@@ over is not easy task . it is possible to maintain its attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ u@@ ating eye . the module can be used from image processing .
type : with this parameter set the desired colour type for your image . it rot@@ ates with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , drain it with a cute 3 @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a button@@ ing effect and decor@@ atively add an ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : is the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the frame decorated will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of images , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture at any point . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just type the text and place it with the mouse . use text positioning , orientation , color from the color space and the character set . the bigger the picture , the greater must be the character set . finally , select a frame for the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you push the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture has been saved once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template , you can apply a template on a picture .
the menu picture template use in the image processing can be used to put template on a picture .
for the template , there is no restrictions on the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format . if you want to add your template from the &amp; digi@@ ous file size , simply send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; ma@@ iling @-@ list of digi@@ BO@@ B @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you set the template on the template . these settings will be announced for the next start .
after the root folder for the template was put in a glance , which reflects the folder &apos;s structure of the template . the selection of a folder will be updated automatically .
under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the present image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
zoom out : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . it is used to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template onto your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
finally , there are three different tools available for cas@@ u@@ alties . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for tension . it is very quick and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures .
un@@ fair mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture more sharp@@ ly . indeed , it &apos;s no little , it works rather psych@@ ot@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric pressure and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright of Winston Chang .
focus is possibly the best of the three because it is really improved the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adap@@ ting .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . these elements are smaller than the dis@@ solution . this in turn leads to a common color combination . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually require any additional shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the home user .
in JP@@ EG pictures , a camera is often applied in internal cas@@ ino@@ cul@@ ation . pictures in the raw size must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners apply a sc@@ opy filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ed a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing promotional train . you can call it with the menu entry correlation .
you should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . generally , you can focus on the menu input Kor@@ rig@@ ate Re@@ focus . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution , the picture is a little bit soft than it &apos;s shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool to mark the soft@@ ening with the menu entry basket and experiment with settings . the show@@ case on the right side of the slide shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ ks is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview can help to edit the image . the window show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should be tried out at first . an increase in the radius or contempl@@ ation process the effect . if you make the visual acuity too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates are created near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed pictures best in its final resolution .
the amount is set by the percentage between the original and the wi@@ dow@@ ing image one that is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the tail @-@ value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . one can thus define a minimum difference to ensure an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft shift between the sounds are excluded and therefore beauti@@ full errors in faces , heavens and water surface are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ying filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the finished picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask has been applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus on an image by improvement of the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected un@@ protected un@@ protected filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to convert a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ ge@@ si@@ er@@ quot ; in which it is a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ing . this is better to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ing . it is usually better to use better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ ks . you can start it from the menu by calling colours re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice the circular spl@@ itting is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; break . the Gau@@ ge d split has a very long tail , which is far away from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original tor@@ ques that is far influenced by the remote pixel . most cases also causes severe results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular di@@ folding . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then in Heiligen@@ sh@@ one .
Cor@@ relation : an increase in correlation is able to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
rou@@ ching filter : an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values vary from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still sm@@ ite the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your visual acuity is auss . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the rou@@ ter filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can be good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . note that the module is very slow when you choose great values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter is set to be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason is that much operations are not visible immediately , which left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and comp@@ ress images , eg ; when JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture .
generally , it produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by this , the un@@ sharp mas@@ ks a bigger neighborhood is used as a shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , it must always produce ar@@ te@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never show the effect of visual acuity . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimum Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the visual acuity . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better at the processing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been done with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods for check @-@ in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regulator of the smoo@@ th@@ ening sets the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the division of the dark , in order to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour ink enables a customized color for the pupils . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most expanded tool , in order not to remove the required arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ tro algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
in order to simpli@@ fy the restoration works , this tool contains several pre@@ ferences to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can also use the riders and Advanced Settings .
detailed reference p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of details . a small value results in smooth smoo@@ ther than the image . if larger values , mainly homogen@@ eous regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.9 should be used so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be subsequently necessary . please note that the detailed accuracy will always be subjected to a guidel@@ ine .
alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ther evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gra@@ dient or CCD rou@@ ches , a high value w@@ l similar patterns will produce . JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will be best close to 1 value .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p defines the relative difference . put this value as the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smoo@@ ther , since it is difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ let effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : if there is often the algorithm run through . usually , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular progressive distance da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ ot@@ rop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , then there should be small for a long run@@ time . you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral parts &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral pac@@ ity in pixels . you should put the value less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More quality you get by the option of this option is only minimal . it doubles the term . we therefore recommend it out .
the buttons save as and loading precisely this . each setting of image errors can be stored into a text file , and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can see how image errors are removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog@@ ous camera . as you see , there is a unique black Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ t in the fore@@ ground , that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and correct image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ous spre@@ ader is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a protected algorithm created by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides selected image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or fashion . effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read it in this tut@@ orial first in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ p@@ ous noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the lower settings of advanced settings may remain in the standard settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . great values increase the time the filters needed per pixel and can overcome the image below the picture and the colour in it and adjusted for minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the spac@@ ing distance from the filter to the front view to determine the illumin@@ ance changes . if it is increasing , the adap@@ tive filter data may not be adjusted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter data may not receive any more space and ro@@ uting or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy of the filter . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter can be removed or noise tips can occur . put it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rou@@ ge or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ less process of the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ less process of the details -@@ settings .
gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas that typically become stronger , however , it does not exp@@ ose the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping factor . if it is increasing , the edges are smoo@@ th@@ ed on variations of lumin@@ ance density . if it is high , noise and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear at the edges . it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used for this . all parameters used for smokers that you have set can be stored in the file system and later charged .
this is an example of how noise levels can change your life . the origin@@ ator is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct reduction was applied with the standard settings .
sometimes a picture is a cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to shar@@ pen a little soft@@ ly is much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen with the menu entry , and experiment with the smoo@@ ther . the window windows on the right side of the slide shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ja came ; photo Rest@@ au@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo file acts .
this filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ ired art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos; , film , compression acts and local mistakes which occur in digital , original or later digit@@ ised images , thereby creating the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and tex@@ tures . the texture is done with a different tool , the image error correction is carried out . the algorithm to restoration work was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ die and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect in some areas . it creates some comp@@ sions &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct this problem .
the buttons save as and loading accurately this . each setting of photo @-@ restoration can be stored into a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can reduce the photograph of a photo with equ@@ it@@ ars . the module is applied to a black and white picture that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) 700@@ Si &apos;s camera on a Il@@ ford ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 iso . you can see the not@@ orious film@@ making on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was applied to an old color photo which has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts about the scanning illumination and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
site Hot@@ pixel ; Tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove those with a CCD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem , because many cameras with JP@@ EG compression has a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and quot ; bright Pix@@ els quot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ tra@@ ction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard button with the picture dark . the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to correct image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note here that the assistant is watching the last dark image and automatically re@@ load them in the next session .
the image range and the preview can help you correct the results in the picture . the window show@@ case shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ ferences .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ ation : it is measured an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels , having a distance of 1 pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic area ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , taken from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure ; the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ancy chamber ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correc@@ tions is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ ment , i.e. , exposed corners , one image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large size format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ra@@ quot ; ( shaded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reach the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lens may also show this behavior too .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . a lot of center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filters , which should be impossible to keep the camera under way . wide angle lens , also with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects arise through motion .
with the large exposure of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by using an equi@@ valence transformation . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction turns the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fier correction filter and control the target image with three additional indications .
density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting efficiency at the point of the greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which transl@@ ates a optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or randomly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ ment , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ iller , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : editing the image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction reduces the lumin@@ ance of the pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target with these options . the regulator have only positive values for you because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ alization of exposure to the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; picture machining from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ing in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . ( 1 ) the correct image and contra@@ indications have also been performed on the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous membrane is a tool designed to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected by copyright algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distortion . color@@ less distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree is the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conden@@ sed form of the picture .
the coefficient of the third density has a similar comp@@ iling effect but fla@@ iling at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the degree is corrected the removed corners to the second degree of gravity . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the thickness of the distortion part of the second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distortion is corrected and positive values of tur@@ f @-@ shaped distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth density . this value is stronger than change in the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter set the reverse signs of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled down the image size and thereby lead a correction of the first gra@@ des by . negative values increase while positive the image sc@@ aled .
brigh@@ ter : this is adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values improve it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box with a preview of the error correction . the values you use for your picture will be saved and used at the next start as default values .
the tons or tur@@ qu@@ id correction should be carried out prior to all influ@@ x or size changes . the best result you can cut this correction as every first . if you make a picture new and then an tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of evi@@ dently of the Fal@@ se .
to help you the best correction is to give you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection you can correct the tons / tur@@ qu@@ id distortion with the help of lines .
if you correct a tur@@ f @-@ shaped distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from image processing or using the zoom @-@ controller of this slide .
for most pictures the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , e.g. recordings from front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that you hold the camera in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction of a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate inf@@ rin@@ gement of the G@@ ann@@ Gur@@ u &apos;s website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared rar@@ er , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you shift the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters set @-@ gra@@ zing and film sensitive ( ISO ) . activate the gra@@ ins texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film @-@ gra@@ zing and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter channels are shu@@ ff@@ led to the re@@ produce of infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos , since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filtr@@ ation applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the origin@@ ator is under ( 1 ) and the revised image was set under ( 2 ) and the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ zing on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase sensitivity of movies , the manufacturers of large silver gra@@ ins of phot@@ o@@ emul@@ sion .
the fil@@ ming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street pictures , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos so you have to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is , although often higher values need to be set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film effects on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and this used ( 2 ) . the used cinema sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous filter ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural images and breast@@ feeding are good for that effect .
there are two kno@@ b controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush are better suited for large images . smooth or , from the other side , look at the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting @-@ effect . the original design is marked with the ( 1 ) and the adap@@ tor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug has been used ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a spro@@ ut . the pictures whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing , therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you could choose to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start using .
there are two kno@@ b with a range of 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b puts the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( smoo@@ ther ) .
this is an example of the carbon plate filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adju@@ sting the intensity of the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving its picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was emp@@ tied in wax . it uses a protected by copyright algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug has a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly good in pictures with a simple structure where color does not work the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ tory landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default settings .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the finished picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of art using distortion effects . it is used by copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in the cells and look like it will look at glass blocks .
the picture blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of artwork using the visual effects . it is used by copyright protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : the image along the glob@@ ular lines get out from the centre . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
Radi@@ al Un@@ str@@ ils : caught the image by turning the pixels around a core . this sim@@ ulates the visual acuity of a turn@@ around camera .
distance : the picture is caught around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera production . the object seems to step back in the background .
motion @-@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the visual acuity of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera , camera .
soft@@ ly in@@ tra : caught the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this produces photos with a dre@@ aming and gl@@ oss@@ y focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle light bulb .
sho@@ cker @-@ sharp@@ ness : im@@ pregn@@ ated the image by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the visual acuity of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent non@@ sense : the color of the colour can be found in the picture and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to create regim@@ ents on your image . this gives it a natural look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows to change the size of the drops . since the stal@@ act@@ ness size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drops on the image .
you can start with the &amp; digi@@ plug . image processing is free of rain@@ drops . use the tool to select the area , e.g. a face that must remain free to stay . if you start the filter drops , the range will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ ro@@ p filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . the tools will be found in the menu of rotating and transform@@ ers .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to zoom out is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture bub@@ bles and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , makes a good work here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
use a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to modify the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality , then try the tool for bub@@ bles .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ash@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ plug has been using a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio unchanged : if this setting is enabled , the new size determines the aspect ratio of the original visual image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smoo@@ ther , since it is difficult to create the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ en@@ ue effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons save as and loading will be used exactly . each photo can be stored as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see one example of photo fl@@ aps , enlarged by a small colour of the size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard penis enlargement .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently guided operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . the mouse is simply simply to cut the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse , the area of the photos can be cut out . therefore , you will receive a good overview of how your photo look like . you can change the size of the right to cutting edge . create a new rect@@ angle by pushing it up with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the item , use the button The button button in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file to save or save the file to save the newly added picture .
in the area of view , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is maintained .
in the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format and landscape format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same as you use cm , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons for selecting the selection , horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to assign the range to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio saves settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are displayed as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected in the specified picture and not the original image .
the settings of assem@@ bling aid allow help to bl@@ ends , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to share a rect@@ angle in harmon@@ ious triangles at the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden center is a division which is on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nautilus pattern or the flowering leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the Ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already by the old Egyptians and Greeks . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you set up your pictures , buildings and even photos to make your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center makes fluid @-@ free au@@ xiliary lines available when you merge into a picture . these hel@@ pers are listed below :
the Gold spiral is to achieve your destination good results for your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles is used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line of its or different objects . this can be just as easy as being without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the golden triangles are also drawn from the top @-@ discussed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ ilateral triangles . diagonal to place the diagonal to place an static object .
if you use golden triangles to inter@@ rupt your frame , you create an effect of professional photograph@@ ers of dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is an attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button paint you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . you can adjust the color of the lines on your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture , where things are turned around a angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; editing and tool @-@ free rotation . select the right rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are measured in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
to your help , the free rotation is available a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse hand in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have fixed it on an important point of the picture , adjust the angle to the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function transformation from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing is smoo@@ th@@ ed the image a bit of rotation . but notice the above warning .
all per@@ ch@@ ial transform@@ ations are carried out around a fix@@ point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the slide you will find some information which you can help to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by transformation .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that are created by transformation .
angle left at : shows the current angle in degrees of the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees of the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
according to the perspective of the perspective , the image will be slightly dirty . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you adjust the perspective , you get un@@ happy three @-@ square holes on the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image with transform@@ ating cutting from the image processing .
the attachment tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no turning , the picture will be dist@@ orted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer .
check your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press on pre@@ ferences , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the face area .
to your help you will find a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the picture , the image will be gotten a bit negli@@ gible . for a single transaction , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two shots are generated twice as much polish and therefore you should avoid this .
after the expansion , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the image with transform@@ ating cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write . the available formats are therefore supported by your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries comp@@ iles were comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you can edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
due to this reli@@ ance on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats on their system . but you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IFF below .
&amp; digi@@ gen ; shows only files in formats . this happens from the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions supported by the &amp; digi@@ plug . in section configuration , you can find further information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select the format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found on Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ gen ; supported both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression techniques on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data to a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JP@@ EG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store losses if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read by Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions . you can convert Roh@@ format images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IFF with the Roh@@ lo@@ op@@ ters of &amp; digi@@ plug . in section configuration , you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports the store of rough pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug . hereby , more than 200 raw data formats are supported . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ations that came from &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but there is no film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings used to play movies use the program to play .

( 5 ) : in the left lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default settings . all entries from the final use of the module are noted .
the side bar shows shows the essential information on the selected image and is largely un@@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are of the EX@@ IF data , when these are available .
this rider is available an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ program . press c@@ tr@@ l ; left C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all pictures within this coordinates must be filtered and displayed . this is of course that your images will contain Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pall@@ ets and to choose from colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colours .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of the installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder as well .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the colour next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button 1 , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing . this mode allows you to select the check box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions , cut and inser@@ ts .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the intermediate shelf : for each color , three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line of line , if any further color follows . if there are three numbers in the intermediate shelf , they can be added as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ;

select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color @-@ selection on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graphic programs . Graph@@ ene is used in science , especially in computer science , used . previously , there was no modern &amp; GU@@ I ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . programs that out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user friendly graphic design with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; kiss .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graphical design ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphics ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; kiss ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GU@@ I ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change of Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph@@ s re@@ calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; represents )
menu to open the Gra@@ ph in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphics ; one &amp; K@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
loading by large gra@@ fts ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack , to represent more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graphic design ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of gra@@ zing requires . you are needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own window . at the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graphics ; without a argument , the tool@@ bar will only open the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list Remove last files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the bottom screen photograph :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is indicated when the graph is larger than the drawing surface . you can select a fixed position in this overview , or select this location automatically .
use the mouse @-@ wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressing &amp; old ; -@@ button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions due to factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
when the file just returned in &amp; k@@ graphics ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphics ; can also remember that later . if you want to change your decision later , you can connect the menu option settings , see ... see , see also .
if you want to open a graph@@ ite outside a current &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; insert , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; or want to open the instance Gra@@ ph in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can also be changed with the setup dialog .
during programming start , you can re@@ open all Gra@@ ph of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also determine how the graph is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph which are to be incorporated onto this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
side view with one on several pages , graph@@ s without head line and with a different font
the page once again allows the possibility to define the behaviour when a file was changed on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can define a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ charging or the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening is the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphics ; if a graph outside a current session is opened . you can open a standard behaviour for this case ( the graph in a new window ) or determine that every time is asked .
the side seating administration gives the possibility to determine the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphics ; you can define a standard behaviour ( the files of the last meeting or not ) or determine if you need to be asked for every start .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add GPS coordinates to add and edit the metad@@ ata of a picture . ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization are available to loc@@ alise images from the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system that is used by GPS and Galileo . height , Län@@ ge@@ - and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track than XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and ps@@ cl@@ one allows you to download and convert the data from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface allows you to bring a number of selected images chosen by a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and then call the menu . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is downloaded a automatic Cor@@ relation which shows the coordinates in red . GPS gauge data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera distance must be converted at GMT time . this can be done with the time zone . click here your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera output . the deviation ranged from below are collected in 2000 seconds . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the difference in 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating in a big time difference between camera and GPS is , you can set this limit here and then keep the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue . this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place . since the dialogue is to use the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed card and enlarge . choose the specific region and enlarge it si@@ e.@@ Add this always again until you reach a far @-@ reaching accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are options to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
this module allows you to export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages . you can select the albums created as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to enable a possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders who can be adapted to the settings . the rider selection allows you to select all albums . you &apos;ll need to select these albums . you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the range including the text box and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side . this tab creates a gallery inside each image . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the picture . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard portrait , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder that contains write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , the file size is also influenced by themselves .
the riders are allowed to give you some of the settings from the Album tab for the images , which are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press off to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to show whether error occurred during production . the web browser will automatically be at the end to show the preview of the gallery . press and close the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG @-@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , using a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ ash@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . this module allows you to create a background colour for the slide . with this module , it is possible to create the format DVD / 16th CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the pictures that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can start using the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au module .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change s@@ orting images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD file . if you &apos;re planning to select the file on a TV standard , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SEC@@ AM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds . the speed of the image process is defined below . a lower value produces very sudden , a high contrast a smooth image change .
the background colour can be set up next . in doubt you should set them black . the name and the path of the generated file can be set under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you need to specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the di@@ vin@@ ation when you are back .
if an indication appears that co@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages on the right below .
the printing assistant is allowed to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together into standard images . these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . you do not expect the best results of Him . do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results !
first choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings onto the picture .
you can now re@@ adjust the values to optim@@ ise the converting process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white . however , the essential parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats . the fil@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a loss@@ y algorithm and produces the smallest file size .
the tagged image format , T@@ IFF , reserves all information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you are going to edit your pictures frequently or you should not use the JP@@ EG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before reading the image quality . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as a storage format , metad@@ ata the metad@@ ata in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file into the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the button . if you want to break this process again , you can break it off .
the st@@ acking mode mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode therefore , for example , if you are sure , for example through testing on a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview can be viewed as far as the progress is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module may also ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can put the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the image .
this module can be used to alter the size of several images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image to be smaller or enlarge . to this end , four types of the image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on the orientation orientation , i.e. the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 wires ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size .
not proportional : a proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can set the printing resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , with background size , boundary size and background colour is accordingly adjusted .
this K@@ IP@@ I module allows you to send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . there is also possible to change the size of the pictures before . you can pull out more images on the list of the subject images and place there .
after which you have started the module , the pictures -@@ window with the images you select is displayed . you can add more pictures on the button . for the last chosen image you will see a preview on the right side .
you can also pull pictures on the picture list and add there to add the list of the images to be sent .
with the button images you will remove the selected pictures from the list of the pictures to be removed .
after you have selected all the pictures you can OK with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you need to add only the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are already attached as attachment .
please do not hesitate to send many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations to the size of the given e @-@ mails . it might be possible to send a good idea to send a number of emails if you want to send multiple images .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and stored again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before you can download it here .
after the election of comments on an attached file , the comments on the images will be added to a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format in the file format file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best suited to use with loss@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore have P@@ NG , if you have a fast internet connection , and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in JP@@ EG format are added , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to sen@@ tim@@ ental pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can watch the status messages , in search of errors . you can automatically start your e @-@ mail program at the end . with the kno@@ b , you can switch to this window .
after the launch of the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions such as you want to show your Di@@ ash@@ au . you can choose here between the selected and all the images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option is using Open@@ GL , using very elegant images of Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , since otherwise the di@@ ac@@ ock will be very slow .
the option file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the left lower left corner during the presentation .
the option loop makes it possible to display the presentation in a final loop . you can then break manually with Es@@ c .
the option you select randomly to select that the pictures are displayed in random order . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album .
the time distance between the frames can be set between individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should be able to show it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . randomly chosen one another effect between pictures and pictures .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au , you can access to a tool bar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to switch to you .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide .
at the left edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not have any documentation . if you are interested , please contact the ma@@ iling list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ gram Note : the participants of this list speak English .

before HTML pages are created , you will need to make some settings . these are group@@ ed into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described .
first , enter the title of the over@@ look and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; export file is to be created on the reviews page . nutri@@ ent information about export files you will find in .
last of all , you can choose which information is displayed on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that all pictures of a party are obvious . please note that &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; currently all pictures are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain viewer .
in this area you can define as the HTML pages are supposed to look like . most setup options are clear , which is why it is not specially received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images . therefore , you will need to contempl@@ ate your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , for example a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . it can also browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , browse . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent proposition a new sub@@ folder .
first you must select the folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location . so , you can select either a folder or select from K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check that this is really all visible for viewing . if you select a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL , which you set here , should be this folder . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy it . in order to specify import@@ ing the import function , see how properly , you have to specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described configuration options are related to all three based position or UR@@ Ls . in these cases , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you define it in output file .
if you &apos;re looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; you can naturally create an HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images , recording place , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; this work will not even do once .
with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import another into your database . image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file , or if there is only a link to pictures in the file , that you can have all pictures together into the file , but the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can choose a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for the images that are found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the appropriate images are not found , the images of the URL you are searched for creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following is described in the dialog for Export of images , which you can call on the File menu exp@@ orting ... .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three selection options available to you :
in the option manually copy the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ via ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . as most pictures have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file is very small , it usually doesn &apos;t want to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , you simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is Maxim@@ al image size limit . if you would like to send your friends images , you would like to limit the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; export the exported database such as described in .
the W@@ iz@@ ard to imp@@ ose is made up of four steps . first you must select which pictures you want to import , then in which folders will import images to be copied .
it can be that you can find the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called out of your database . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked to imported categories from the imported file and which categories meet them in your database .
in the fourth step , you can use the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . for example , you can see on the image .
it must be easy to browse images and watch : if you see pictures , you often want to watch images from different picture groups &amp; md@@ ash ; if you &apos;re looking for example images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures appearing on which this Friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information on your images , above ( 2 ) the search and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities .
K@@ Phot@@ o@@ ader has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it was extended and today also your videos . at many places in this manual it is spoken about images , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; stores all of its information stored in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . it is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup power , to secure a dis@@ kette or revisions in CV@@ S .
&amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this in future starts . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; if you like another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ phot@@ o@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings can be created ; set up in a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; in the following section of the user you will be explained to you the different settings .
to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can call the preview options and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
in this case , as you can define for any image , different properties , e.g. , places , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialogue that is used to process existing groups . you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol for each existing group .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member@@ ships , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a Medi@@ af@@ eds as explained in .
in view the setup options available to you to the members of the member list . you can select the category that you wish to configure . in the left window you will find a list with the current category and in the right one list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; divi@@ des its modular system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . nutritional information is found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; however , most modules have an help page you can call on the memory .
since the modules are used together with one another , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; therefore , you should always check out new modules with the Demo database before using the command line &gt; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned !
the applications that are using the modules through K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . also if &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ;
this is sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , thus all pictures that shows you the picture exhibition at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album has to hand over a list of albums . here you can see &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums , so for example , if you &apos;re using the category people , so if you would like to select individuals and give it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the modules which modules should be charged .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo album ; with your own pictures start .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the windows of the menu that you can browse your image database . at the moment we will not find any information about your pictures . in the section we will show you on this window , now click on the entry pictures which shows you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; is the possibility to see any image with notes , where the image has been added individually or for a larger number of images , click here . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures in Copenhagen were recorded .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ ses as you can read in the section , if you want to see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can choose three lists with a text box by adding people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; as you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the images within the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can find that the names are moved up to the above , to find people faster and classi@@ fy .
if you prefer to show an alpha@@ betical list , click on the icon for s@@ orting under the list below .
if you have chosen notes for each image separately , you might be able to edit all the selected pictures and have these pictures with notes . just click on the images and back buttons , which are located right below the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and select the menu item added to one &apos;s note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lies in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the US as a group of over@@ board . to indicate that there is a group of over@@ taking , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Find dialog it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry into a category and place there to do this entry to an sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you are doing your categories alpha@@ betical order .
you can shift the individual elements of the dialog by clicking the bottom edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a window of your own window by drag it outside the window area .
when you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which allows you to save the current construction and appearance of the window .
you can also select a frame entirely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then click on the window . this can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with layout images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you don &apos;t have a filter . for example , you can see the size of the watch images by simply clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy .
when you place an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the picture packages . if you don &apos;t have a window to be opened with a picture display , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture . simply select the respective images you want to delete and select either the delete button or select the Edit menu . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; however , pictures may also be saved without you on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; if not all needed pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images where the right @-@ right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are available , so &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; you can view this pictures as well as pictures .
as you see this function you will find out that you would like to copy files from the folders , and then copy them back . if you would like to avoid doing so , please do not wish to avoid the installation of the relevant CD . if you like to avoid doing so , please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it .
in the menu Pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you may lock the images so you want to lock up for other un@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures that can see your little sister , control and menu entry everything except current view .
this means you have set which images will be hidden in the fall of the case . if you want to lock the laptop now on your little sister , select the pictures that you have locked , hidden . if you want to display the pictures once more , click on lock .
it is also possible to define a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the images . in order to establish this password , select password change in the menu .
please do not think that this picture protection is not very safe . for one you can access or delete all images on the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this type of password protection is only used to conce@@ al those with &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; not very familiar to conce@@ al the view of private pictures .
the reason why you &apos;re all your pictures using &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; manage and run hours over hours , of course you want to look at it sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album also features a picture _ and video editing . this can be viewed from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have on the picture , like e.g. who is made on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily draw it with the mouse , and you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is indicated above . all of these options are available following a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this browser , see , appropriate entries to this view . if you click on the Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were interested persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys image high and the end . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as slide . &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; then a new picture is loaded after a few seconds . how often a new picture can be checked by pressing the Str@@ tr@@ l button and Plus respectively Min@@ us . stopped and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; is it in full screen to change . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can easily draw a rect@@ angle into the picture . with the mouse button you can easily draw a rect@@ angle . with the minus key you can draw out the Plus key into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the principle of the zo@@ oms , the zo@@ oms puts on the screen to a pixel screen .
notice that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that they &apos;re in and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and minus .
with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make remarks on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can check the image and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name . but you may consider only to mark the picture and look further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with pictures and mark it as good or bad , while you watch one after another .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to set images with features while you watch them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter . see a picture where the A , B and C features are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have all images you have chosen , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can simply use any module to copy the selected pictures on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view view , then you can add characteristics to the pictures , simply press the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you to paint &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; click on the picture .
the painted picture is not stored with the picture , but in the database . on the way you can reverse your brick later .
you can see an image on the painted picture . to activate the painting mode from &amp; k@@ phot@@ o@@ album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; you must work the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely to rule , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then , their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire module .
you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object as all the accommodation is already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following can be displayed , so that you can choose the right position :
with delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed settings , click on user to take these changes . if you have invalid values , you will report a message with an error message . then you can correct the input command or dis@@ rupt the changes with the error messages .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setting dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains the documentation .
when you process a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview of the site view .
press on preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered by the chosen texture , even if you want to select a part of texture ren@@ ders ( for example a texture in a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross is marked the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a wire model element . you can specify this value relative to Vis@@ i@@ bility level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are only then displayed if they are selected or their visible stage is smaller or equal to the chosen field of view of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ el ; has a window arrangement than default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the default window layout or if you need any type of order , you can set them anywhere . you can also store several window arrangements and change between different arrangements .
to get a window over or under any view , drag the moun@@ table to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the moun@@ table to the right or left side of a view . the new view is based on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you would like to arrange several views over one another , go to the summary in the middle of a different view . you can then change between views through clicking on the cart@@ el box on the top of the views .
the final possible window arrangement are read@@ ed views : views which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , draw the moun@@ table on the desktop or click on the small to the left shown in the summary bar .
to complete a view , click on the small cross in the summary bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can get them at any point .
the current window view can store you with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can store the window mapping under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , it was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ el ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry to the scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many ro@@ uting modes , from a quick preview to top quality images in highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool bar or in the menu view R@@ ender modes ... choose , the following dialog will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section to the input fields .
in combination @-@ quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctive lighting . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User &apos;s User &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
if a picture is rec@@ ated with only one ray per pixel , different errors can be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stud effects in curves , lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better .
if you switch Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as a standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adapted again and adap@@ tive , because each pixel will always be divided and adapted to the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray mat@@ s a ray of pixels . if you adjust the difference between color values of pixels using super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference is passed between the color values , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub@@ ways , which can be followed individually and are on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch to j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays is a tiny sum , to avoid regular samples .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; that calcul@@ ates the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to charge a scene with this feature .
on this card card you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams do not have an object .
opens a new window for the display of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , unexpected , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , select the menu entry file imp@@ ute ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ el ; not even the full set @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if in case of imp@@ lic@@ t error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box will show a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ el ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the economic view , click &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . specify the path to your document and version . supported , versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( such as high field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you get files that are not in the folder of the scene you must also use the path to these files . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the colour of the right ch@@ equ@@ es for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can adjust the object of points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values give a more precise wire model and thus require a better view for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as bul@@ let , you can set the detailed stage for two directions separately .
when you cross High detailed analysis for advanced projec@@ tions , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions from perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
if you cross a wall , a wall is placed behind the objects . the wall is depicted in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor is stretched below the objects . the floor is depicted in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you are able to activate plat@@ ens , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for the ren@@ dering of the scenes is used . the values for the depth and swelling can be adjusted . more precise information on the parameters will be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window @-@ orders . in the window of shut@@ ters , you can create and store windows arrangements .
the standard window classification : displays all existing window @-@ orders . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when you start the program .
the window p@@ agen@@ das list shows all existing window @-@ orders . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a button with the button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can create and delete views with the button .
the position of the new window . with a new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with the card you get a cart@@ el view together with the previous view and floating on the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow any more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate yet easy scene , but you would like to make a ball at a level .
but you should carefully read the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that you can only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene will be in the dark and you only receive a black image .
if you have done everything faul@@ t@@ less , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the following pre@@ set window mapping :
take a little time to meet the menus and existing symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation so you can get an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , therefore , you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu input . therefore , you have a scene without any objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) , this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object tree contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find further details .
change nothing of the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but notice that the camera can change in view points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the button user or input , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene , for example , you could insert a quot@@ as ( insert os@@ he@@ aders ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method for solution of this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; actually provides an easier possibility . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and then press the button user or input . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view shows also the level even if at the moment only as a limited state . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you &apos;re interested in the object tree , you will find that you can see the entry for the floor . in this case , you &apos;ll find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : scal@@ ability , turning and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move to the bottom to the exercise a unit under the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose translation and set the values as follows :
just select the ground to adjust its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with one click on the button preview how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ments only contains a matte black material because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the easiest way .
if you do not see any color in the preview and sco@@ op , then click on the button application and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is right now . if you render your image now with one click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course you are not the colour which you have expected . here are further settings needed . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree to be colored and change the colours in the object of the object properties :
this step should you just be able to perform this step because you should have the basic work@@ ings of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; they should have already understood . the ball can be just as easy as the ground :
in the opinion of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input or the button application ) , so the ball would be in contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would be floating over the ground , as you have moved the ground down to a unit down@@ wards .
of course the Ren@@ ders now makes a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as a color :
select the object of the item and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , then select insert and set the values as follows :
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or press the input terminal .
the brightness of our gl@@ am@@ our and reflection results in some very good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces even if metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ vel a scene from the perspective of the viewer from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera to render the scenes ) through each pixel by the objects and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects act like an example fog . thus , the scene will be mach@@ ined by pixels .
as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see anything , the picture is simple black . obviously , each scene needs to be saved , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ el ; created
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you have to enter a name and disk space .
represents the scene recovered in the last stored version . all changes have been rejected since the last store .
this menu entry allows you to only select if you do not have any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last re@@ vo@@ cal command . this menu entry allows you only then select if you are used extern@@ ally .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ . , here you can change the look , the key@@ ring and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for the change of the keyboard code . you can change or add new commands for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ er using this option .
opens a dialogue to set up the tool bar . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ . commands to add and remove commands .
one b@@ ump map is a way to fit rough surfaces , without changing any hi@@ ves on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file both for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic structures are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to a pixel basis using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a more comfortable image and browser browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images on display .
images can be displayed either in a window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or key Return .
you can adjust if any image will be displayed in a window , or if all pictures are to use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right @-@ bottom corner . if a matching fil@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog box &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five postcards . in three of them , gener@@ a and machining and slide show , you can adjust the working methods of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two others , short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser , you can set the button cuts for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background colour which can be set down below . default is not full screen mode .
this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for slide show .
this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; at the end of the last set of open@@ er folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show will open this folder in the browser window .
click on the coloured bar to select a background colour . this is used in order to fill out the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is also filled with the selected paint .
you can select &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; thus , only some of the file types are displayed , which may display the program .
this option is given for large images the display window increases to the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
determine whether the slide show will start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
the time between the image change in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated as long as it is canc@@ eled . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the key@@ ring for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the box cards short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the second part of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one part of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short representation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short representation .
shows a look for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short representation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display windows for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame to look for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
portrait photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ plug ; picture processing . &amp; show photograph ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; Show photo , is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; Show photo , makes it easy to report as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . this shows a dialogue with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show photo , is a project that is supported by a community . if you are a more frequent user from &amp; show photo ; we will then want to answer questions about other users of &amp; show photo ; however , we &apos;ll hopefully answer questions about other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be able to be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; it is the developer of ma@@ iling list to join . guide to the developers mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show photograph ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to set up on these settings , you need to set up on these settings . you can change between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color which is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure dict@@ ator should be selected . the colors should display the colors with what you want to view , in contrast . lower exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show photo , has a side bar on the right edge , which allows you to provide important information and promotions at the selected pictures . the same page bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; Ch@@ est ; &apos;s an application to scan of pictures , which can no more power than images and scan down .
&amp; Ch@@ est ; is an easy application to scan and scan , which can no more power than images to scan and store . &amp; Can@@ l@@ ite ; can store a dialog for each image to store or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ .@@ org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; an@@ ite ; with the command -@@ d -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner can &apos;t be opened , or if no standard sc@@ anners are displayed , then a dialogue to choose from the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . dis@@ rupt &amp; break down .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; G@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat these options .
to activate a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ can and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the pre @-@ lock is started through the preview button .
in order to better select the picture , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom into the window that the complete preview of the window fits .
when the picture is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when I preview a preview in the Settings , then the picture is displayed in a window window , as shown below , then the image is stored and lie down ? EN leads to a break and you &apos;ll go back into the main window .
the button settings will be opened prior to the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the image if desired , be watched before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview can not be desired by the user , the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way as you can select images . dialog for each image open the dialog in front of any requested image . if you want to store this automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame to ask .
this setting defines where the images will be saved without a file name . if the images will be stored for each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button .
this parameter defines a picture @-@ to @-@ save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for storing . the automatically stored picture gets uploaded to a numerical Su@@ ff@@ ix which is stored automatically , if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to store . this value also changes the compression rate when saving . if select the image quality not selected , the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button assistance starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; cran@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; G@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing the settings can be used to end &amp; cur@@ l@@ ite ; to end .
&amp; Ch@@ est ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and is used by the lib@@ ks@@ ane library containing under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs keyboard cuts . below you can set up a list of these cuts into the Player window , click on the right button . select the &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ specific key short@@ cut you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window and define short commands ... select .
you can also set up existing multimedia keys that they function as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands work . this makes you your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are often found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions of collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , playlist , playlist and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP @-@ function should be &amp; z@@ b ; look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command lines options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing dep@@ en@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the dialog , so the user can &apos;t run why a script does not run .
beginning Re@@ quire &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ ear@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binary for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is and for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the script scripts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts or simply extend the needed functions . you will quickly realize that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange your scripts using Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be enclosed .
most scripts make it possible to execute external programs and commands . usually the ex@@ ec function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is relatively easy to be called . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; amar@@ ok ; send noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts will continuously monitor their standard entry and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use of it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and store the setup data each script needs to take care of each script . when a script is launched , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change indicates that a new piece is used . the script can now query &amp; b ; with D@@ COP @-@ functions further information about the new piece ask ( for example the metad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals an amendment to the volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ised Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le covers the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu entry can be used . in order to remove your own entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok Script to the menu Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; amar@@ ok ; terminated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for instance , for example storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ite script management can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server . such packages are basically compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extended amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lad@@ le modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ sar parameter to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can go up on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang on the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use the Cat@@ amar@@ ok for your entry .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprising to use .
with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , instead of getting through endless menus . maybe you may also find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ctors browser and the Quick Search will you find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some playlist , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist @-@ browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode , and the smart playlist automatically select the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many more flexible USB devices . these and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok for the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to comp@@ ile the following to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install :
da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when compiled . if you encounter difficulties , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; has some options to enable or dis@@ able to enable or dis@@ able to configure the comp@@ ile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain dep@@ enden@@ cies must be met for some of the comp@@ ile options to be used , so that they can be used in section system conditions .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you &apos;re interested in the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should not hesitate to use full .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulties concerning the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple box cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok ;
player @-@ Windows display the player window in addition to playlist - or out . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
note barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar it has been compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the voting @-@ bar@@ ometer .
tuning full : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar it has been compiled with support for m@@ oods .
deposit files at the music files : this function is only available if it is activated . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder by &amp; amar@@ ok ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : let you choose which browser is required by &amp; amar@@ ok ; if a browser is needed .
to use other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not included in the list .
playlist when moving , the current playlist automatically stores when arriving by &amp; amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when closing .
relative paths for manually saved playlist : if you activate this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory of the playlist , otherwise it will be saved the absolute position of the music files .
a current piece of changes can be seen at the unit , that the playlist window will be open / off , in order to keep the current one always in the visible window area .
in the play change to the context @-@ browser , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the current position you can adjust &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is in three parts sub@@ section .
in the font section you can select the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press out , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection user @-@ defined color scheme you can define the pain of choice and can choose a separate color scheme . use it the activated color selection for the front and background colour .
play at the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing automatically with the piece in the place , with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen @-@ Display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade ensures that the text is depicted in the O@@ SD .
own colors use the option to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors use not activated , the default boxes are used ; colors are used .
the input field display shows the text in the O@@ SD . by entering the plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of the available space holders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can define , on which screen is to appear a multiple @-@ monitor environment that should appear to the O@@ SD .
select an audio driver from the select box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this box card .
the map collection is used for setting all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to browse to the music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to his name . this section also includes check boxes for setting , as is to be done with the selected folders .
browse sub@@ folder : this ensures that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be browse to music .
check out changes : it enables &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import and import them : causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found playlist in your Colle@@ ctors ( .@@ pl@@ s- und .@@ m@@ 3@@ u @-@ files ) adds to your collection . the newly added res@@ o@@ ists will then appear later in the playlist @-@ browser .
the part Colle@@ ctors database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver will be chosen to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ SQL . if My@@ SQL is selected , further furnishings in the sub@@ window My@@ SQL setup is required .
the My@@ SQL setup section is used for setting up the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; it is used under the computer : the network port is entered where the database is entered . name : is the database name which is produced by the connection .
use us@@ ername : and password : to set the data required for the database .
the cart@@ on card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of played pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
the played pieces send and so the profile update : this setting enables it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ts to the each played by playing . note : you can see the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is a audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you must have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including those contained in it for example ) &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them , for example , modules or scripts ) . we have written a small instructions how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD predi@@ ct that your window manager will operate the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ ct@@ op@@ .org , for example . we try to support amar@@ an@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they are preparing an excellent development environment .
probably , one of your files will make a mistake in the Conference Li@@ b library for days . you can view this error to the Conference Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang out the capac@@ itated file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is that Tag@@ li@@ b hits reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Conference Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use My@@ SQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is slightly more sophisticated .
make sure all types of &amp; amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then this leads to the editing of the Met@@ a Information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate the machine . turn off when in@@ active ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ pack@@ et by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open to a crash ) . if it comes to an often occurring crash and send us a good back@@ drop , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program dates back as UTF @-@ 8 and write to the Met@@ a @-@ Infos , but they do not use as Unicode character . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &apos; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &gt; New ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; a mistake when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; &#91; $ MP@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols can be viewed in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 always . this is a well @-@ known mistake in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects can be ignored in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , click on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that this setting shows its effect in some cases up to three times .
if you received this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : case L@@ ook@@ up error : accidents mode : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ offset pixels , then check if amar@@ o@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ rot@@ amar@@ an app _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ thi@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that amar@@ o@@ K may find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems arise in the lightest through the help of an expert your Uni@@ x or Linux distribution . you can also use the help with other users or developers . they also use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please carry out only one error if you have something to have an error in amar@@ o@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist - how do music pieces arrive there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired file . then draw the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has been changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are designed for evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , you have to display the evaluation template in the playlist , and select column evaluation . click somewhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command line for Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from the playlist .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to playlist and let it fall , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the Add @-@ button , you can save the playlist . click on it .
probably you &apos;re missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel program and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains lots of very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( over the right mouse button ) . also you will find it about the menu bar at tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s really ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence the actual question is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ M@@ M / M@@ AS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support so pretty any audio format . gam@@ ers can even add text and P@@ NG device !
it can be ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default settings are not a MP3 dé@@ c@@ or ( made of patent reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F2 , vs. : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input a@@ ste

if you use the g@@ amer drivers with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be achieved simultaneously via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of the problem and help a solution . for gam@@ ers you need to specify a different string ( e.g. oss@@ om ) .
the does &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media will be de@@ coded at first . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re reading a dec@@ or with little over@@ head . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and send the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA exactly as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ ers driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server using highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ arity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ) :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause playback to playback . read this error report . the enlarge of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get all the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ ly _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ as &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less s@@ lugg@@ ish react to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to remedy him .
g@@ amer is installed but if I want to switch to the g@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashing &amp; amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . carry out @-@ regi@@ sters to register all the g@@ amer components .
read the g@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ Kanal # g@@ un@@ amer .
try this ( end you ab@@ amar@@ o@@ K before ! ) : - Store you m@@ peg down , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module folder by G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run @-@ up register again . start now &amp; amar@@ ok ;

under Settings @-@ K ... Audio Edition give you the device . typically , for example H@@ W : 0 for the standard sound card and H@@ W : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

the queu@@ e of the waiting long open you through the queu@@ e @-@ long administration . if you want to add a piece , select the piece in the playlist , then click on + . you can also simply add the mouse or the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the sequence of pieces in the queu@@ e @-@ out administration .
there are three types of dynamic playlist , of which two are already pre @-@ given ( the details to setup this follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds another random pieces during playback .
inser@@ ts pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces will be in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to this dynamic playlist .
double click the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist , or click the right mouse button on you and then select . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist - under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes random mix and playlist mix re@@ plen@@ ish your playlist and you can add the playlist to your collection , and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled out at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynam@@ ical mode . this will use your existing playlist as start point . the same menu entry can also be de@@ activated via the same menu entry .
the button new fill the current playlist and add to the dynamic mode new pieces . playlist editing opens the dialog for editing the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the opportunity to click on edit . as a consequence , the dialog opens to edit the playlist .
here , enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist is continuously growing , the adjustment for coming pieces will be over and they are not heard in this playlist . if the adjustment is active , the already played pieces are removed with regard to the setting of used pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are kept at the beginning of the playlist . so you can easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because each piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side were described already in the previous section . on the left side of the slide you can select from existing playlist or smart playlist . if you cross several playlist , add &amp; amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the crossed playlist .
some scripts allow their own settings . you can adjust the settings by clicking the script and then click on setting .
you can install new &amp; amar@@ ok ; scripts to install on script . after installing the script , a new entry will appear on the list . you can also install new scripts right from the Internet . you can also get new scripts right from the Internet . use the button More scripts .
if you want to no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . please click here to un@@ install the script .
if you are looking for information to write your own scripts , please check in section writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . in order to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick instructions should show you how to create an audio CD by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD in four steps , you need to run an audi@@ ble installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn a audio CD of MP3 s or any other loss@@ y compressed file , please remember how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check whether a audio CD is created from any loss@@ y format . use the project au@@ sp@@ ect .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has completed the burning process .
this quick instructions should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to execute the steps below , you must have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have to have the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialogue with the possible settings to burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; press Settings , press the button Start . you now see a dialog box that looks like this , or something like this :
in this dialogue window , you can follow the progress of copying process . once the reading of the original file is completed , you will be asked after an empty CD medium that the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules cannot find . to fix this problem you start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search ad for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS by your basis folder by &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org . you can get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums out of the forums and learn more news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ Rs in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ Once Mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ Rs . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that are also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually you can reach &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning from CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality at filled audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally called Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is an absolutely open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional technology available for audio encoding . from OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e. g. MP3 ) are completely supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . lame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FL@@ AC : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FL@@ AC decoder module and the external audio encoder module to read and write FL@@ AC files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FL@@ AC , Muse@@ pack decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a program program that can hin@@ der and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully equipped car system for editing , dis@@ assemble and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super @-@ video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , for creating a mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections , the different recording of the various albums can lead to the un@@ pleasant effect that can be played differently from the different albums .
e@@ Movi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ load projects again . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on the entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save under will display , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you would save for each individual project file .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then select between stores and modifications . furthermore , you can break the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will not ask for any stored project , which should happen to happen exactly as you would have called for each project file .
closes all open projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project will be asked what to happen , as if you had called file closing .
if you call this entry , you can select about the release dialog for adding to the project . this has the same effect as if you want to draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the Properties @-@ dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the media you can only open if the project has already set data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each Project type has different potential settings , most of which are written about what is this ? -@@ help ( available via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you &apos;re not using files for multi@@ disciplinary CD . the data of the previous meeting will always be included , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function illustrates and remove all the files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes any files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files .
this allows you to create a CD @-@ copy dialog , which allows you to create a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn sometime later . you should also wish to copy them if you wish to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create a DVD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also use only a copy of a DVD which you can then burn after . also , there is also the possibility of changing a DVD with the help of copying files , so the target media must be big enough to get the whole ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disc .
opens the dialog for shaping a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which gives the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
it burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data which then can immediately be burned by pressing the burning touch . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks for an * .@@ iso file as a source of data which can then be burned by pressing the burning touch of the button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window is usually used after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used individually . it contains information about the discharge video , coding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the specified medium . this information is displayed in the table view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool bar is presently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small l@@ ath at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content will also be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , lock and un@@ lock of the drive or throw out of the medium .
the table view switches off or out . the table view allows editing and pulling files into the projection table . the table view is also selected to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view has been selected .
the head@@ line switches in the projection view or off . the head@@ line is a nar@@ rower area that contains only visible projects if the projection table has no real function , it looks pretty nicely and separates the project vision clearly from the other views .
this opens a dialog window to change the keys for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistance systems . thus , system administrator privileges are required , therefore , system administrator privileges are required , therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work correctly . this dialog is intended to Person@@ alize and intended for finishing the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is as many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope therefore , so is your taste and the way of your assignment is crucial , which the bit@@ ing programs provide you .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to make use of &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started before . then enter something like the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can get a D@@ COP @-@ reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface that can only apply to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) The cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string shield ) is add@@ res@@ l ( URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ string shield ) , peri@@ l It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) and offset Vol@@ un@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
so it is possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash Project = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der cash / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ Project cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / go fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; outputs for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him can be saved easily audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data files in WAV files on the hard drive ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers that are encoded using this WAV files ( these co@@ di@@ ers needs to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the Tit@@ le of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the machine ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wav @-@ files are compressed using the MP@@ 3 or OGG format , or in other formats such as the loss @-@ free FL@@ AC .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , by &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia uses . almost every distribution has a pre @-@ compiled package , if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers have already exist . however , all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributor , but it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile anything about yourself . however , if FL@@ AC is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which co@@ di@@ er@@ ers / file format should be used ? chapter What is a small introduction of co@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; au@@ dio@@ eci@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to detect any copy protection . if not the mechanisms of copying is not possible . do not avoid the mechanisms of copying attach@@ ments . just avoid purchasing copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD will be explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim structure of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which co@@ di@@ ers are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB to get from the Internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is measured manually .
this is only a short list of commands from the main window . on the side step for example , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab maps for the program configuration .
if the CD@@ DB request will be delivered to CD data based on demand in the CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , the latter case must first be made to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the setup code tab - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so the selection can be read with any other encoder as the standard . it is to note that previously the encoder has been configured in the tab card settings dialog .
opens the file manager , so the file will be selected to code a full &amp; CD instead of adding a full &amp; CD .
opens the setup dialog to configure the number of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ as ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog from &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; with various postcards ( such as encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . get here before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers , compression rates , and helps you to choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FL@@ AC it is also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files .
among the audio formats , which lose information through data compression depending on their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above these bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ No so &apos; free , lame is still included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from one machine or a computer @-@ based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG @-@ game devices are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ audio installations . today - early 2009 - these devices are usually only supported by MP3 format .
a short list of parameters to audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; lame &apos; help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ Pre@@ set media &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ Pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi installations with high quality .
&apos; --@@ Pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for fi stereo installations with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ Pre@@ set extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one piece . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi installations with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of one Tit@@ le . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi installations .
&apos;@@ --@@ Pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ agger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolute highest quality without review to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD , information , typ@@ ed manually or by the program automatically out of the free@@ DB via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / used / used to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ bility programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or help to the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD , add to the key words ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3s with lame are encoded , the switch -@@ tt is to be added by lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks like this : &apos; -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which the audio CDs can read / enter the information up yourself , so that all the other information can be downloaded to the calcul@@ ator . it is said to be observed only by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the Pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ lain ) is not a lawyer . however , there is no information that you will be added on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so can neither the artist nor the music enterprise be added . all information can be obtained from a b@@ yp@@ ed by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( f@@ ake ) address when used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when access@@ ing the server ( This may only know the programmer that has verified the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator is used , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally is needed to use the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth within the network and resembles the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information on reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what is the reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my machine ?
there is rum@@ ors that you want to know c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to be more precise , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this is not yet to happen .
to store the deleted WAV files , the coefficient may be selected and therefore select the desired file format . during the first opening , there are pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FL@@ AC ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab map . other co@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ erer package has to be installed by the Linux distribution before the co@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined coding . additional information about co@@ di@@ ers are in chapter 1 Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , further information about his switch can be obtained through the input of an command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
that can have many reasons . check the device the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and readers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FL@@ AC &amp; etc ; ) . try to put both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could be a hint of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD . this will not be successful !
there is an chapter with a step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips as you have to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine because it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ aming on it ( eg ; by trying to copy anything in with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the prec@@ urs@@ or of a &amp; CD , which has to be repeated for each end @-@ up &amp; CD ;
here we determine the parameters for compression of the music ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we divide the program using the free@@ DB to use the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to edit a &amp; CD at any time , if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is given to the reader program that it can read the &amp; CD @-@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive . if this is not available or if more than one &amp; CD is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the lock map general settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example it will be displayed as input as shown in screen photo .
only in case of in@@ complete information , select that you will be informed when information is missing for the dispens@@ ing of key words ( tags ) .
the Map CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we &apos;re comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloading the Internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; connected to the internet so it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD entry is found immediately , if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag file , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Con@@ qu@@ ad - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ;
apart from this example , if you want to enter everything manually , select the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , this is more than 620 MB big , if you &apos;re worth reading this . however , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the internet . how do the system , which data will be saved ? read the section over free@@ DB . do everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have to download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look into a mirror server within your clos@@ eness . on this way , the load will be distributed between the host . however , this setting is used as the first attempt .
both will work as equivalent to the server , as many Fire@@ works have moder@@ ately bo@@ oting the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there may be more happiness with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocols is usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit the data on the free@@ DB server . the first check box should de@@ activate .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp does not exist on your computer )
number of inter@@ mitt@@ ent pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time comes with just one existing drive ? try reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , hence try yourself .
CD ; after reading the final note : cross this to the &amp; CD ; take a look at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must be specified by the files / folder where the WAV files is ready . if the box is not checked , the files are not checked in the private folder . don &apos;t forget to do this folder if you want to do something with WAV files .
all as input as it is on screen photograph . the command is a bit long , under circumstances , something must be smoo@@ ther to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ Pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later amendment of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in screenshot . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of simultaneous WAV files : using dual @-@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
this is because we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music you will never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading of the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the type of music is organized on the hard drive , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will pick up . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
since we are using a &amp; CD which is not yet available in free@@ DB , screen photos are a bit different from the data available for a &amp; CD ; with successfully supported by free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn to manually delete the &amp; CD , instead of using them from the Internet . comments are indic@@ ative .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this sample is a &apos; special &apos; Edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , then the &amp; CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as shown in screen photo . this is only when the &amp; CD should be identified as audio CD ; could be identified and found by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , you are looking for questions and answers after the help or proceed back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
please note : if the &amp; CD has been successfully taken up by the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces have already been completed , and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in case that there is more than one entry in the database with the unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; available , you will select a window , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best on your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you are not selected the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the Settings ) , you can also manually redeem it by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , but you will need the connection to the Internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the design shown on the next screen photo . the title of the tune in the first line of the input field &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered any more in the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ ally each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful sampling the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor , so you can not only start with the artist and album names ( for example whether all the words with letters of letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up on the tab card code ; take a look at the tab &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . take a look at the help of the co@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
just select an entry , obviously with the style of the open @-@ ending CD ; in this example it is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to find under Rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one .
the window of the CD editor appears and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current one . the title of the piece is definitely the case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process you to the same way until you have entered all titles of the &amp; CD .
please note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . you have already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . just the titles are selected so selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select the button will select all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when clicking on the button selection , read the reading process , this window appears to confirm the confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is to be read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error message when you are trying to work with a box that you don &apos;t have yet installed . plays the not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we entered here in an example . have you checked whether you have access to the folder for a temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the bug has occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and code in parallel . note the status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behaviour . the only thing which seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . with powerful machines the result is un@@ clear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to be able to read and code ( from however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e of the code . after the last piece is coded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ des ; , you need &amp; kiss ; 3.@@ x and 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the coefficient of your choice .
&amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; is now processed within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is part of the cau@@ stic package you can download from there . most distri@@ butions contain an anonymous copy . the most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use the prepared package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help looking for your needs as it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs on settings , has many variants of settings . the best way to read the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various postcards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was clicked on the first Start of the program , without any point of views like it should proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t fix this manual . it is the first version of a manual to &amp; k@@ au@@ dio@@ cre@@ ator ; that is what you can do . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has taken this passage and therefore agree with this suggest@@ ion .
strange if you managed to take the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to get , then you don &apos;t need it , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and caravan player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to other things , he has some features with real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke @-@ line links of texts , some other features ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projectors , which is required for G@@ US Cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of every MIDI channel by pressing the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ di@@ or ; -@@ window can be drag@@ ged to KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( gra@@ zing events or tex@@ tures ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the procedure in each case .
support support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , KM@@ id starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI @-@ synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select from the menu File . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also make a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and feel the button you play in the tool@@ bar , select the record player from the menu piece or fill the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid , -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive .
if you find that a song becomes too fast or slowly played , you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the tempo . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar or the select of the menu plug@@ ging in the menu piece , interrup@@ ts the playback . bed the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use lyrics and another . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is used automatically , which you have to adjust nothing manually . if you select the record auto selection menu , the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries in the event or of the events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you are able to summar@@ ize . these are played by the number . in this section you can use the collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item ... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ ying and then add the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the s@@ wo@@ e in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . there is again the file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the adjustment of automatic transfer to the collection .
when automatic transfer to the collection is activated , a piece for opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will automatically be added to the active collection .
if it is not enabled for the collection , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied in the opening of a piece . then this collection will continue to be added .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the sequence of the menu selection sequence of the menus , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or edit random order in the menu , the order will be specified .
in order to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the sel@@ ective list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump one song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button on the right .
in order to ski@@ p a song back , select the button ahead , the entry predicted pieces of the menu piece or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , choose the collection of the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter , since they are not being saved during leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not General @-@ MIDI viable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events in events , which understands the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create an MIDI map which conver@@ ts all events of the Chang@@ ing patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore will always be used to sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound@@ cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US Cards , FM @-@ devices , and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . thus , you have to edit the appropriate file of your hand ( with your favorite dog monitor ) .
an MIDI map is a text file that stores all the needed conditions for the play of one piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ M@@ AP section , which may appear as often as desired . but for this , however , every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ M@@ AP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ M@@ AP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ M@@ AP &quot; A more key@@ map ... EN@@ D de@@ fine CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ M@@ AP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that de@@ dol@@ phins is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can help in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
this section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equality is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and don &apos;t leave the line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that do this instrument onto the tone with the number M . if your keyboard supports no ri@@ fl@@ ashing ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . to do this , take the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ M@@ AP @-@ section :
so , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ f@@ le ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the concept of drum @-@ patch of patch it is meant with which every sound represents another per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , tank , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as many keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ M@@ AP section is used to indicate how tones are depicted on a specific channel or instrument .
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ M@@ AP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as the presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keyboards for each channel and any instrument each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
keyboards are used mainly to form sounds at the per@@ cus@@ sions channel . check out as an example the supplied key@@ chains .
this section can be used to form some channels on any other way . if you want to change the first and second channel , you can easily make it easily in CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ M@@ AP @-@ section .
however these settings are useful for keyboards on a specific channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ ANN@@ EL@@ M@@ AP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , built after the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on Channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will also be using the name Name for this channel . if you are going to use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this canal . in this case , patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ cus@@ sions patch on the per@@ cus@@ sions channel .
the value for P@@ it@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o gives , in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied by the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then re@@ directed only . the value 4096 is used so that the map file is not dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal ) .
this setting is used because GM gives a keyboard to play a P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der Event with the value 4096 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , several keyboards may be higher up to one oc@@ tave up to one oc@@ tave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use an MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu under Settings , item MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a full range of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a tool , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to indicate the played sounds . view the settings in the menu @-@ side view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD shows the speed where one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the speed of a song . so if you find , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows at the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a piece of music it has to be played . it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can not force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you compiled a bin@@ der ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid - without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agreed , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
before , you should absolutely be able to add automatic adjustment to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow key to the left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard pace you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; kiss ; desktop window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or det@@ oxi@@ fy ( if I want to play an MIDI file ) or play a file , merely go to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; - window switch and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without add them to a collection , turn the setting automatic to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ E . only do you want to play the first file only once . so you put the adjustment Autom@@ atically adding to the collection and open A.@@ C. Your temporary collection contains then an MIDI file .
then connect , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to create and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or watch the postcard , this will anim@@ ate me to program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ idan ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ on ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am unable to take a lot of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to program MIDI files , making music , and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ ar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll be able to contact me by using a MIDI file , but should get in contact with me as I already have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and has no eman@@ cip@@ ation of money . I would like to empha@@ size that I am only able to write my messages from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Keep the bug that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks is also Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magnus pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ ass , the Thor@@ sten Wes@@ le@@ den , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , fault compensation , or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all of these excellent musicians in the network that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ D@@ EM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .

&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for MP@@ layer , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by MP@@ layer or ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as playback of DVD , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; kiss ; user ma@@ iling list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . in addition , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window , which is only then displayed if information is to be recovered .
it is possible to locate the preferred connections under the menu . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played after each other , you should use the Permanent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional level of view . if you anc@@ er an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and start playing with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and continuous playlist can be changed . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ Player . you can also choose from the menu click here , but also through application . for this purpose , click on a name of a category cli@@ sts that will be viewed from the menu . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML contents of this section is displayed .
after changing the XML files , you must select from the menu that can be chosen with playlist , and select either the modified mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the examination mode should leave or select another group without the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during the start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ tains option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / signal .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / video player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml must be observed . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would be anno@@ ying with the end animation , but the user can therefore termin@@ ate the application a second time .
a simple example of a Start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; el@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / dev ; / lt ; / dev ; / lt ; / dev ; / lt ; / lt ; / dev ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / mixed ;
there is a rider to the configuration of MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ Player . here , the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ Player .
there is no rider to this playback dialog for &amp; k@@ m@@ Player . everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c , such as the back@@ end of the back@@ end by m@@ im@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the Sch@@ ro@@ dec @-@ Moz@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; you can even add the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the application dialog of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; is available in one consoles or search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the designed process is called cra@@ ck@@ player . if there is no mistakes , the baking output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type ( of course only if this was determined also ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on shall play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; can be used by TV cards , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ Player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner device and the TV channels must be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the box is to use the dialog under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should ports be detected , of which one is selected . the correct name must be found ( eg is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably a DVB t .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ Player can only use X@@ video , it should also work on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server should also be functional . for the XFree86 server , it has to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . )
internally they are used by K@@ MP@@ layer for the sources of different names . at the time of the origin of this documentary these are d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ s , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ d@@ source and v@@ ex@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the playlist .
is there any hin@@ ts as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I don &apos;t play by him ( not from any of the v@@ cd : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is considered to be root root according to the device . it is definitely sure that / dev / c@@ drom will be shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts to start slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked up to performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user surface and network support and is used for comp@@ ile of &amp; c@@ ile ; needs .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font @-@ application application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be attributed to the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively , respectively , ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the using &amp; Linux ; distribution included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or install CD should be used ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; c@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without comp@@ ile and are included in the hur@@ ry ; page included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the proposals for documentation are taken into account . if the support is requested to this project or its documentation , the contact about the tile is to be made .
if you have any questions or comp@@ ile a comp@@ ile of &amp; c@@ ile ; on or are desired , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list ile de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Working area . furthermore , offers a simple , direct and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his options to learn how to get the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the correct selection : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH : difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mac@@ ros is also able to use . a less sophisticated but more realistic vom@@ iting is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
just a good reason to &amp; lat@@ ex works here , it is not the ultimate book for it . to rule &amp; lat@@ ex ; right , for example , H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ ined .
just as other landmark languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the gener@@ alization features such as paper format , side effects and text area can be specified as well as a kitchen with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Review } and must be closed with the \ \ \ &apos; command } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a well @-@ efficient function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also create some related settings on the document .
document classes : hereby , the type of the document must be seen : article ( Articles ) , Book &#91; Letter &#93; , Articles &#91; Letter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ut@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ ut@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined document .
coding : this is what the character encoding is set . modern systems are going to use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list includes the usually used packages for ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they can only be balanced at the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes by Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN EN ) . they should always be used in preparation of German texts .
new users can therefore not worry about . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; To@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source text@@ books - the emphasis on the used commands , att@@ itudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , you should not have noticed any mathematical search function . however , you should have noticed in a modest appearance of output file . however , you will save you through the rapid appearance of output file .
with the automatic completion of the environments , in case of inser@@ ting a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates an empty line ( for the input of the text ) and the associated line to the check box . this function can be reproduced in the menu item ... La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; refin@@ ement of the document in the following elements ( part is the most attractive and sub@@ divided the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be very helpful always . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ m &#93; absolute file ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ylon File ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file includes a description of the format document and other information such as font art and is also available in addition to PDF the commercial output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools available to view , conversion and print output of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and tann@@ .
when using the back@@ log @-@ search are the elements of DVI ; -@@ file was clicked on to an element in DVI ; -@@ file was clicked on , is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you have clicked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is clicked on , becomes the corresponding passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer rela@@ yed .
master document : this function is used for working with several files . using a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .@@ tex files . during the use of a project a project wide master document can be set up for project settings .
quick@@ ening : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code are available ) .
file services : in this mode , the DVI / file is brought into DVI ; -@@ File on the back @-@ to @-@ stream , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; after the quick@@ set .
considering the editing tool bar the three great selection fields should be displayed . the first selection box is designed for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ sible and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box for other information is available for occa@@ sional articles such as keywords , fu@@ elled notes , and references . the ver@@ itable g@@ ays are :
name : this command is called for a section , a picture or other element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection above a selection box ) .
using quot@@ ation from quot@@ ation , a select list with literary entries are displayed . on &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files are made in &amp; c@@ ile ; files are written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font . it can be specified for the main text , the legs , etc . , etc . , the following text includes :
when calling &amp; c@@ ile ; two sel@@ ections are available for the preparation : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document art and festival legend of the settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand on the basis of this document .
the cl@@ amps after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the instruction . the adjustment &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets out the fon@@ ts . if the font is specified , the font is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex have to be compiled ; the sim@@ pl@@ est way is to use the menu ( s ) or the button fast .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; ile ; for storing the storage needs automatically .
if the comp@@ ile of the document fails , it should be sought after the errors in the protocol . when using quick@@ set &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , it should also be considered the protocol .
a surroundings ( English . ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . if , for example , a report with the fon@@ ts body will have created a different font . the order \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } , \ \ To and \ \ \ To { environment } are to be sh@@ atter@@ ed by the issue in the environment . it is covered in the environment ( English ) .
all changes will be obtained only within the surrounding area ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ } . there is no restriction ( number ) for the first changes in an environment .
there are many features available to the alert of the read@@ ability and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain types of fon@@ ts , li@@ ve@@ pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands may end either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { feeling } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is open as long as it is closed with a \ \ &apos; } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ &apos; h { word } Cur@@ sively .
\ \ quota : created a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background is given to writing the source file with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; draw lessons are now follows a step @-@ for @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the assistant a little text was entered , a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . in this case , min@@ d. a quote from a few spots in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to application should be seen in order to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be turned back to the editor by means of editor or C@@ tr@@ l ( in the internal viewer ) . an external viewer needs to be closed .
as soon as DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and fun .
DVI ; is a non @-@ independent file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ able ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers on the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF , transform@@ ers or computer monitors .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed out ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar is the transformation of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion can start in different formats using the buttons on the tool bar .
the pre @-@ search encour@@ ages the direct go from the editor to the matching position within DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this purpose , only Modern under Settings K@@ ile has to set up a choice of tools .
in order to seek out the previous search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be clicked on one line of the source file and close to pre @-@ search results . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; comes with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; c@@ ile ; added and to the corresponding line . for this purpose , &amp; ile ; be specified in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece . ( settings the ey@@ ep@@ iece set up ... Editor )
if using quick@@ ing of &amp; DVI , it should not be possible , an error can be submitted . if a mistake should be submitted , it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window .
the protocol file uses the error source in the source code . in the editor you can always check the button in La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¼ ch@@ ised La@@ Te@@ X error . in order to consider the faulty line , the error needs to be clicked on the error in the log file and switch it up to the correct row .
once the corresponding button is clicked on the tool@@ bar button , a window appears to select the selection of the available template for the document . the vo@@ ids are :
as a selection of empty document , a document may be written either by reason to re @-@ written or to the assistant to the fast preparation of a new document . more information is included in the section .
real users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates are created in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file has to be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file presentation ...
when creating a new document , some strings may be replaced with different data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables may set up in settings in the custom@@ ile settings ...
therefore , when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which are variable :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ : this string will be replaced by entering the document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { Note } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry to the commands in editor . as soon as the document has been completed in this way , the following steps have been completed :
with the creation of a new document , its own template can be fully balanced instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files created . will be used to create an easy way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and which are described under described steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be carried out in the menu tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
in order to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his collection should be experienced the manual of K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start working directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; start .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command re@@ ference , which can be called for the volume of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it includes an exclusive description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as its syn@@ tax .
double @-@ click with button C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; -@@ word that means that in this way , click \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par with this way .
when drag@@ ging the text with a squee@@ zed mouse button , the selected text will be copied automatically into the cache .
when using the arrow keys , you can touch parts of the source file in the Edit@@ orial Window .
&amp; Har@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source codes and empha@@ size this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex differs from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another colour .
a lot of assistance must come up . this is a unique type of bookmark within the text . it is also highlighted by a single type of edit within the text . this spr@@ ing@@ ing stamp allows you to highlight this jump , so that they automatically ref@@ uses to mark the first input of a character .
the Edit is probably one of the main aspect effects on using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; provide important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; provide special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the text selection :
lt a complete section of ( group of lines that signi@@ fies on both sides a blank line ) . this enhanced meaning has not been added to tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source file . this is the only noticeable thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is therefore that the transfer is separated by two empty lines .
watch the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also called &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a distance ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to be part of a part of the document , it can be easily removed and removed by pressing the button . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ word of C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with own commands for a faster result . under edit , the following commands are included for the text of the text :
removes a complete section . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description on editing section .
it was already clear that environments are a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; to play . therefore , &amp; c@@ ile ; for further commands under editing surroundings for a m@@ ful work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command will be spra@@ yed at the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the order to open the environment .
with this command will be bound to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to check out the surrounding area .
when the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , turns to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many ear@@ ne@@ cked environment commands , quickly the open environment can be lost quickly . this command will close the most beautiful surroundings , so that the wat@@ ered environmental structure will not cr@@ ush@@ es .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X Group are a few important commands that correspond to the editing environment .
with this command will be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the inserted cl@@ amp .
with this command will be spra@@ yed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the feeding cl@@ amp .
when the cur@@ sor is placed before or behind the cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , will be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
during the input of many veil@@ ed groups @-@ brackets , the last group can be lost quickly . this command will close the most recently ended group , so that the closed structure of the &amp; tex ; group is not dist@@ orted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions for implementation is used . for the purpose of implementation it is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the character is used for two simple instructions for the sign . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two shut @-@ in charge signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic closing of the double @-@ charge indicator can be set up under the c@@ ile settings ... La@@ Te@@ X enter and can be switched off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ish or French ) , as well as German or fran@@ tic sei@@ zing signs . there are also many other languages available .
at the setting of Shift ; entrances for an intelligent line breaks . in case the current position within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , add &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close to a washer @-@ environment close to &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a tigh@@ tening cli@@ ffy break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . this can be found among the settings ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users can arrange the columns in tables and thereby apply all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . if this tab@@ ulator is , it is impossible to in@@ ert . if this tab@@ ulator does not allow it to be added , add &amp; c@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the columns are added to the current Tab@@ ul@@ ator .
even though &amp; K@@ ate ; already a good source file contain@@ ment has been added , this in &amp; c@@ ile ; for special commands ( usually for ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) it is still available for different modes . all of these modes can be set up for different ways below settings .
at the beginning of a new environment , with the command \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } , &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically added the \ \ \ &apos; Command : \ \ \ &apos; s command } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the pitch is the last character of the input , the last character of the input will be removed , and this makes the reference list . on the other hand , the list may also be resi@@ zed by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are made of a short description of the command . alternatively , the descriptions are made available , such that a simple jump to these positions can be open to these positions using Edit Spr@@ inkl@@ es , and the newly designated parameters will be frozen .
under Settings F@@ ile ; set up ... col@@ ile ; aband@@ on@@ ful settings of these lists can be made . there are several different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands , as well as a place of general language used .
the command mode is not possible for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in and the call of the ful@@ fil@@ ment mode will be a large list of environmental requirements . on the other hand , the environments are used as often that &amp; col@@ ile ; a special mode for contamination of environments .
when calling of the editing mode about the menu @-@ editing environment or the key space bar , the order is automatically frozen , and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued on the sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be completed by setting the input .
after this is completed , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list of files , even a first \ \ item command will be laid out .
under Settings F@@ ile ; set up ... col@@ ile ; dispos@@ able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of editing mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line user @-@ defined lists of degra@@ dable , which will immediately be replaced by l@@ acqu@@ iring strings . as an example of a cold check box the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word can be entered in terms of editing or the C@@ tr@@ l + Alt idle button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large , however , are not helpful for the automatic confi@@ denti@@ ality . however , it has been found that many people are written in a document more than once . this offers &amp; ile ; the ful@@ fill@@ ment for everyone already written .
this mode can be set up in the menu in the menu . a hur@@ ry can be switched off . here , the threshold value can also be specified for the ad placement .
the ful@@ ler files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / c@@ ile / Complete / mode / the personal home folder . mode is available for ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ( ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( w@@ ish@@ list ) or tex .
the dialog graphics design is designed to design graphics as easy as possible . to provide basic knowledge of the basics , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS -@@ files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for savings and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF issue is re@@ arranged , the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script will be re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to pay attention to the result of the work , you have to comp@@ ile the source code . all building tools are group@@ ed in the menu of creation , creating converting and Create .
for viewing the source file for viewing such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ iece ; or the further transformation can be used to the keyboard . after that , the DVI @-@ file can be converted into a standard with Alt @-@ 3 ; it can be converted into a PS file and can be viewed with Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command @-@ spr@@ ite , a viewer is usually called upon a comp@@ ile . should not be used in a built @-@ up viewer , then a new window will always be used .

&amp; kiss ; is a graphic editor for managing many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures interface allows you to create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ lines delivers the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
any signature signatures will be any signature from the signatures file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures using different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily sign@@ atures the same signature is read from the signatures file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you will create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . thus , you will receive a new signature ; empty signatures ; in section Sig@@ nat@@ ched ; and insert in the lower section your new signature , save them with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click on the flo@@ ppy disk .
you can create any number of signatures at any time . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use E @-@ mails privately or freel@@ anc@@ ers , there are always sufficient signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File File Remove or click on the icon with the red cross removing the tool@@ bar .

the version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative information ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a sub@@ position . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; I have worked on my pro@@ c and how excessive it is . take it another piece , we need to give it a graphical surface ! no longer need on a terminal , simply clicked on the icon of the XML processor and finished !
this application is based on a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is connected to the current work folder . if not , then remove the current work folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder like the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when my pro@@ c is started .
as already said everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quantitative information , there is now a great graphic surface for this .
if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then they simply dial the current work folder . if not , then choose the current work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to a copy of the screen , your file is faulty . please check the error and try it again .
if the file is already checked in &amp; quant@@ um mode , then they simply connect the current file . if not , delete it with current file and choose to check the file via other file - file selection .
if they only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , please click the well @-@ formed review selection .
to use one &amp; D@@ TD ; file specified in the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is the specification of the Defin@@ itions @-@ UR@@ I ; in file selection required .
Ja@@ well , &amp; quantitative ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file processing in &amp; quantitative information is already selected , then they will simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file processing file with the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file , as the result is called , the file will normally be stored in their home folder .
the plug @-@ in , which &amp; quant@@ um threatened , have to do with &amp; quant@@ um . thereby , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can &apos;t wait until someone can &apos;t wait until someone can be used in &amp; quant@@ um . plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GU@@ I ; -@@ elements . more information can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start @-@ in with the Edit menu . this allows the following dialogue :
this dialog allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new add . we describe every &amp; GU@@ I ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location , it is quantitative ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a type of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quantitative information ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties - dialog configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the top name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as Team Leader and Sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of Team Members who he is . this is done by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears to be fat after you are : text .
top names and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders if something is done . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something particular is happening in the project . one example would be the drawing of the opening and closing of the project , so that a file would be backed up , or a script that plays a file in CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create events , processed and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the address chosen in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such as a ladder .
comments are special comments on documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
note : it can be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary range , followed by comment text .
remarks can be sent to a determining member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the team leader of the project manager Sub@@ project leader After the en@@ rich@@ ing and sub@@ project managers should be given the corresponding range or sub@@ project names , as in the examples below .
nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ notes , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the cl@@ amps are invalid .
&amp; quantitative . is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ening languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic is supported and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages supported .
the settings are accessible through the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ specific settings are covered , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Quant@@ a ... to be called . this dialog extends over several pages that will be treated in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; quantitative information ; regarding tags , including car , can be changed . the entries are :
large / mini@@ atures of tags : large / small friction of tags : large / mini@@ atures signi@@ fies , the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small friction of attributes : large / small friction of automatic attributes . normal large / small friction means that the attributes will be added as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically exclu@@ de : if appropriate , it is optional for tags for which the exclusive day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for easy tags .
start and closing day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate coding during the entry .
M@@ ime types : m@@ im@@ et@@ ypes for det@@ ecting different types of files . by means of the standard , the default option can be restored .
standard drawing code : the coding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files ( where the coding of the file can be sur@@ passed ) . however , this setting is extracted from the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is extracted from the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quantitative information ; created regularly backup copies , so with a blackout or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as the saving file . also for even stored documents , a backup is taken regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edit@@ orial area or your own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ on ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views are drawn into each other . it is the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning bar -@@ section serves the control of the possibility of shifting the view of war@@ nings by att@@ ing from non @-@ questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also change the symbols of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in split mode . see the different modes .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ents no@@ des in the document , can be hired in detail .
in the range of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse buttons .
in the area of structural adjustment , the visibility of node in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree in editing and how deep during a change of the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty blocks are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found where no element was found in the current document .
the area to the volume of ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded in the editing on a large text . discounts are valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s valid , there is a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ l ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation something different means in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cri@@ pt .
plug@@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are members of the third side , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part application application , the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when plug@@ ins of a plug @-@ ins must be given the following :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if it is not at a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / li@@ b .
input : this information is transferred to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the folder .
load component in &quot; Only mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ products refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : this is enabled , then testing &amp; quantitative information ; if the default information is correct , then the plug@@ in will not be available if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative ; from version 3.3 , the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting was completely re@@ developed . Die@@ de@@ bug@@ ger was shut down , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ um Saul .
the use of the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project begins with the selection of suitable de@@ bug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the options next to the de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated for a de@@ bug@@ ger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative ; -@@ user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of over@@ watched variables . usually appears in the left @-@ hand dock .
a view , in which all hold points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ ger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ ger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in with , on debit demands . this action is used by default if a project is opened , which must not be respected in the normal case .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen sitting the session . closes the connection to de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ates the lute to the requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to create a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the edition of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bug@@ ger edition .
points to de@@ bug@@ ger , to start with the execution of the script and to send information on the revised variables as well as the currently run on line . if this is done , the version is done . if this is done , the script will start with the requirement .
points to the de@@ bug@@ ger , with the execution of the script , without information to over@@ watch variables and the current line number . if this is done , the execution goes on . if this is given , the execution begins as soon as a requirement is made .
the de@@ bug@@ ger will lead the next script in the script , without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bug@@ ger will lead the next script in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include , it is fixed .
points to the de@@ bug@@ ger , the instruction to go over and to the next so , as if the current is not .
opens a dialog box where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the over@@ a@@ woke value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable may be entered or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale , as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on h@@ tt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quantitative information ; you can adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; quant@@ um .
document type E@@ edit packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ um . they enable &amp; quantitative information ; abilities to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts ; abilities such as car completion and cal@@ end@@ ars . their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quantitative ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . day folder contain two file types , the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files containing two parts , the text and instructions faster into a document as a user could ever add .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created earlier ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see details about converting .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the Fe@@ at@@ u@@ res@@ dialog , the &amp; quantitative information ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even tool bar allow quick insert of tags in a document without risk of writing .
tag file are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything about yourself otherwise .
the tags type is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a only element type element .
this element describes a attribute of a tags . this element can only be used for any attribute . it sets the name and the type of attribute . in addition , there are more tags that will be shown how this attribute will be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
is available to fill the source codes for the attributes listed in the tag editors , and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative information is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; quantitative information is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and methods . the arguments put to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day group@@ ed out the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
determines the position of the attribute box of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field on the dialog . this day should be present for every box in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration begins : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be neat and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the day XML files , the tools dialog is to start in &amp; quantitative ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , check the check of the day XML files in &amp; quantitative .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file should be schem@@ atic day .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 day XML file . in this file it is described a &amp; PHP ; transfer function . the fil@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed via D@@ TD Bear@@ ing D@@ TD ; for a modified &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created with a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries be created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quantitative information ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD : / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified Name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can restri@@ ct action to set @-@ up actions ... click on New action leads to the same dialog :
this action is assigned to the button . clicking the button user can be assigned a button closure ; with K@@ one the current keyboard cuts can be removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est promotions . it can be entered in detail in the detailed settings and inserted by the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current C@@ urs@@ or position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that may change the document or modify ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quantitative information ; even the quick release dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs .
the first must be the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter . for example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ aris variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable , which can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file , file name : / from the documentation name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; process will be replaced by &amp; quant@@ um . only one instance is running , the text can be used to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used for controlling &amp; quantitative ; from the external script .
the parameter for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the listed methods , a script can be obtained from &amp; quantitative information ; on the default input can be determined , which is to be sent to the standard application . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
according to the input can also be re@@ directed the output of the specified application . there are two kinds of issue : normal edition , written on the standard issue ; error messages must be done on the standard output written , which is set to the default configuration written by the value that the select output is set :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . press the new Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and if the day &apos;s attributes and you are planning to activate the action , activate the &quot; Day process , &quot; if available , so that a input is possible on the use of the action .
Ig@@ ou@@ n ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from the menu menu ; select other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the promotion does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
in mind that the day is start@@ up , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green will usually be interpreted as los , rigid , further interpre@@ ts ) , or should at least , a message to the user indicates that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start -@@ tag in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol , there must be still associated with the action . this happens to set the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quantitative information ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field you find a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and place it with other tags , so it &apos;s still there , or confirm it with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quantitative information ; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be shared these for better overview by a few separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool bar setting up dialog over settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after the selection of the element , which is to be added to the tool bar , press the button bar to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator does not support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button on the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by try all symbols in order to ensure that everything works .
back in the proper folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct file , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) should be downloaded ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quantitative information ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formul@@ as language you like . therefore , this chapter , as I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an exist@@ ential documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part we leave you to the second .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example , version 1 = extract 1.@@ ht@@ ml Section 2 = -@@ 1.@@ ht@@ ml Section 2 = f@@ c@@ .@@ ht@@ ml @-@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ ht@@ ml tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ ht@@ ml
the tree defined the visible part of the documentation in the Docum@@ entation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = inde@@ x@@ .@@ ht@@ ml G@@ etting Start = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction = Sh@@ tion@@ .@@ ht@@ ml ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , basic syn@@ tax = long @-@ syn@@ tax .@@ ht@@ ml ...
notice the # before G@@ etting Block and Language Reference . it shows that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the box @-@ depth ( except the reason ) md@@ ash ; but try it even out .
note that the table of contents are refer@@ enced to one file ( and consequently , at the upper end of the building table and md@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative ; Resources .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be shown for the operation of the context @-@ sensitive help . by selecting the functional name and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Con@@ text list ( Cont@@ acts List ) and the file lines .
a simple list of separate Con@@ text elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just as well as $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps for local and global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are well and worthy to be shared , submit your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used on the &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by &amp; quant@@ um . -@@ Society . you will not be rich , but to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantitative information ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email to send menu input , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with e @-@ mail , tool@@ bar menu of files and folders in templates and scripts in the scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ users can download and only available if our team needs them as correct and use@@ full for the publication , for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can choose a look . in the dialog New Resource , you need to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and clicking OK .
the up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool bar bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before the installation , investigated &amp; quantitative ; the integrity of the resource by examination of integrity and signatures . in case of problems you can carefully see . if the integrity given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work with XML @-@ languages which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ um . it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of day files will be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and Conver@@ ting to a D@@ TD . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
targets name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / d@@ res@@ p folder .
! Do@@ ct@@ ype Defin@@ ing : the string that is in ! do@@ ct@@ ype day , like HTML P@@ U@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / or e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should be released
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after the conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quantitative information ; according to the conversion and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to be adapted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ um of Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand and to understand this fundamental concepts of &amp; quant@@ um . this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts , without understanding &amp; quantitative ; little benefits .
in &amp; quantitative information , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quantitative .
global elements are available for anyone who is widely selected &amp; quant@@ um . by tool bar over actions , everything is being marked in the common folder structure of &amp; quantitative information ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators different tool bar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific samples and tool bars . local elements are stored in user directory so that they can use only this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to business segments with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted sizes . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which colle@@ cts the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
quant@@ um Committee ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a few main areas : the Edit@@ orial Window , the Bau@@ man@@ ors , the Kart@@ on@@ ites with information and the tool bar . please beat in and for more detailed information about these areas .
you can click with the right mouse button to obtain a cont@@ ex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all di@@ ets , re@@ load , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right commands in the Edit@@ orial section lead to another context menu relating to the mach@@ ined documentation ( cut / copy / inser@@ tion ) , editing the file under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file if the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the Edit@@ orial Unit , the tool@@ bar of the editor will be present . presently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quantitative information ; the tool bar will be adapted to new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if they want to paste in their document , then click on the symbol that the day represents . if you want to insert the data for this just one day . if you want to add multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill up different fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and navigate within the information and quantitative information . in the presentation of Kart@@ on@@ ites are available to files , project , pattern templates , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative information ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by means of correct mouse click . promotions such as add , removing , high load or delete the files from storage medium can be performed using the shown context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quantitative information ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is open to you all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context it is used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative information . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are used only in the project . more about templates can be found in the project .
here you can find information about the available script languages . clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send an e @-@ mail .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document is displayed . by the right click of an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the Element@@ um . by right click of an element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree will appear among other building concepts . it can change various attributes and name areas . it enables you to change the contents of all the available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the Web @-@ technique for your development . it can be downloaded from quant@@ um documentation for &amp; quant@@ um . it can be downloaded to your documentation , and by adding a folder doc or a project you can edit and viewed by adding a folder .
by default , &amp; quantitative information ; two ant@@ it@@ ators at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the usable information : the news window and the problem window .
this ant@@ it@@ ator shows information on each in quant@@ a running script . thus , for example , the D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .
this ant@@ it@@ ator shows all the errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ um Saul ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; quantitative information ; business segments are extensive expanded and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate bar on the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quantitative .
a further function of &amp; quantitative information ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; quant@@ um . send the tool bar as a compressed file over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; quant@@ um .
it is reasonable if you want to adapt to the location of &amp; quantitative ; -@@ files on your system . for this purpose , auto@@ conf may get a number of options to be delivered to the configure script . / configure --@@ help you . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; quantitative information ; you should verify that your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their I folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative information ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative information ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; the developers started to deal with a close idea : what would be when &amp; quantitative ; a unique , ext@@ endable brand @-@ up editor would be ? well , this would make him the absolute most amazing web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . combined : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be generated &amp; quant@@ um ; therefore , suitable &amp; IDE ;
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; quantitative ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; kiss ; developed in good use of free software , the idea of why developed it ? thanks to &amp; kiss ; -@@ rum@@ or is not only this possible , but allows users to developers , &amp; quantitative ; so to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative information ; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this enables automation to increase productivity with almost every task . by dealing with the program comp@@ iling , they can read &amp; quant@@ um . ( more about it can be found in any ) .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a spe@@ edy web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is not connected in any way with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L license version and produced a commercial program .
more in details about the details of this document is written : / quantitative a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; input , or help@@ center help : / quantitative a ) .
&amp; quantitative and is currently developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a high @-@ speed list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as template for the later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template , only one error is reported .
converted to inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board , included special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ friction that they are displayed correctly and cannot be understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ ening assignment .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ lock , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used for inser@@ tion of &amp; URL ; s are used in the Anker @-@ Tag .
switch the log selection on or out . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; to select .
goes directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or S@@ ED with GU@@ I and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the screen window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ger .
evaluation and start@@ up of the problem repor@@ ters at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative ; principal owner . the problem reporter will be activated once you change to the structure .
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to bookmark a mouse click .
when there is book@@ marks in the current file , you will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
bookmark the other hand @-@ opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative information ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
present a dialogue to add files to the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the folder directory .
searched the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or a folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
how &amp; quantitative information ; the project is administ@@ rated . in chapter &amp; quant@@ um Saul ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads the tool bar . these will be kept in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool bar . actions only need to define the name . actions need to be added by means of tool @-@ tool@@ bars . tool bar will be stored on tool@@ bar bars or you will be asked if you want to store the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool bar from the field of sight . it does not extingu@@ ish them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
therefore , you can send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to that &amp; quantitative ; -@@ Team so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu option opens up a new em@@ e message with the tool bar as an app@@ endix .
allows the up@@ loading of tool bar to the main server , where each other can access it . see in .
load one &amp; D@@ TD ; you have made or anyone else made and convert into the &amp; quantitative information .
load / refresh cap@@ tions from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the Ent@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP should be used to renew without the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder fails to fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific under@@ pin .
activ@@ ating or disabled the intelligent entry of tags . at present this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion signi@@ fies that &amp; quant@@ um correc@@ ts by means of tool@@ bars if this day does not contradi@@ ct the rules in this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above menu points . click here . click on the activated plug @-@ in disabled .
select the syn@@ tax statement for the current file . the list of available her@@ ding schem@@ atics depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms to create the developers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
review the syn@@ tax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application Ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the various types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch mode can cause time or un@@ beautiful graphics . it is recommended by default mode , which is also the default mode , or the sub @-@ window mode that is equivalent to &amp; quant@@ um mode ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with selecting a paper , the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantitative information ; the main window was switched on or out .
the changes in this dialog uses any application that use the HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
the behaviour of the Edit@@ orial Unit deals . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete records from the tool@@ bar , or modify them and change the sequences .
this should create an aid correspon@@ d@@ ingly to the environment of the mouse , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative information ; is a qualit@@ atively high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but like with every open source project developers can always use your help . if they want to support &amp; quant@@ um . if they want to support &amp; quantitative form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , for example , after filling out the project , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed . all these paths and author information panels can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics are set .
here is the name of the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative information ; -@@ Project file . by default , it has stored the name of the project in small letters and without spaces ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project folder .
here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access , except one worked local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you can use this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol may be used . depending on the remote computer , it might be necessary to adapt .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard templates . if a joint collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ ation you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ page scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go somewhere else .
check if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be embedded in . if a project is started an@@ ew , not an@@ ha@@ ze .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the folder and you can make a precise selection of good co@@ res .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ha@@ ks or , by removing the check@@ box , out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can upload in the menu with project project characteristics in the menu area profiles , or with the key@@ ring Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder ) , which are to be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
supple@@ mentary option to up , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ indicated are excluded from the project .
the projection of the project is being loaded by opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read .
this enables the desired de@@ bug@@ ger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in this case , the error search is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set up , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing a very own construction site for every profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window of event configuration , one can add event actions to change or delete these actions , change or delete events . event actions are executed if a particular event happens , such as the Shi@@ ps of a file . see details .
by default , &amp; quantitative information is provided by default . the last project that was opened . this behaviour is currently not possible to influence .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; quant@@ um argument ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quantitative ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project .
the project developers are free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
folder behavior as well , however , the entries are opened and opening with ... in with the right mouse button @-@ on @-@ call menu :
here different profiles can be searched for . the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button is canc@@ eled to remove the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forget to make programming . this possibility is useful if frequency load is needed and the rather uns@@ afe password will be saved on the record - option does not come in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion prior to the upload .
in &amp; quantitative information ; many high @-@ loading profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . on the editing or creating a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
this is the Name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them to be stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read on the plate , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text .
a projection view is only a set of files and tool bar . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simply plug@@ ging in the view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the newly opened files and tool bar .
views can be stored or deleted at the tool@@ bar project or the tool @-@ tool bar within the tool@@ bar project tool bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative information ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; quantitative information .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ um rose ; best on the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . use and tool distinguish . adding tool bar is covered in the section adding tool bar .
the tool bar and symbols can be adjusted either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , the tool@@ bar can be set up , tool@@ bar codes or tool bar can be carried out , which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be seen on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool bar , the entries can be removed and action displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
tool bar and the actions on them can set up the tool@@ bar in the menu with settings ... and set settings .
templates are in key document bet , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; quantitative data . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or each connected directory with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system available in the storage room . templates have set in &amp; quantitative information ; in about the restrictions you need for the file system .
some with &amp; quantitative information ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions required at the start of each template before use .
binary is everything that is not pure text . there can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary files are usually found in documents by means of global templates ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / URL ) . some examples are found in the storage room below global templates . more information on the template is available in .
documents can be created by any text documentation . based on these templates , new documents can be created in corresponding sub@@ folders . one makes a simple report for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the storage room below global templates . see in more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into documents based on a template , but the same text area can always be inserted into documents by a comment via a final menu system to be found on Jav@@ as@@ cri@@ pt or Perl . some examples are in the storage room below global templates . see in more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates serve for all Web sites as template . they are a collection of different documents organised in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ um .
create a document structure based on exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a refer@@ ral template .
as soon as this has happened , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the front room under project templates .
select text in your document , and then click on the file as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with pulling and put on the site template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only needs to copy to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as pulling and pick or add over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the Project Files to a folder on the right and secure site template , secure a name for the template and secure . by default , it can be saved as local or global template .
project template enable a very well @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and head@@ lines , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link with them . in addition , one can keep some things on using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files used in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / Apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / Apps / quantitative / Templ@@ ates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as described above .
to establish the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button to select the folder and select the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a select box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection has been canc@@ eled as soon as the attributes of their own Attri@@ butes are inher@@ ent .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the gene@@ alog@@ ger in the previous edition . if a regular folder was so adjusted , there would be templates in this path , except it would be explicitly activated . in the case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular folder .
allowed leading or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a file with special head@@ lines / foot lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , you have the context menu ( which show the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders , or copy and insert of templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantitative ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divi@@ des the editors in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : he invites you to document a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and activate the source code editor , in which the necessary modifications are visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor in one document , the &amp; PHP ; contains , shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ora of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; page editor . it is not necessary to edit this code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode is exactly like the first one , except that at the same time running the modifications in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ cker switching the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quant@@ a .... following the option of V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is to be set . in principle , the recommendation is : a little Spanish for fast calcul@@ ator and a large range for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of website , so it is possible to select the documentation of the visible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor possible . the document Properties -@@ dialog is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created , which is to change the reduction of the suspension body .
Met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document even e.g. tags for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows editing the in@@ hal@@ ted , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word key .
CSS rules are the new way to design the view of pages in the browser . one can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as with the Met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ sty@@ ling template by pressing the button @-@ opening button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sor is as in a text processing , possible thanks to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted via one type , and can be deleted by typ@@ ing or remove removal .
the insert of tags is made in the same way through the tool@@ bars , such as the source code editor . it is said to be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags are not removed earlier than an anchor day , which is inserted by text , any other an anchor tag must be removed .
some of the tool@@ bars such as the tables assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists of tool bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for testing sty@@ li@@ stic templates . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ li@@ stic templates , search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the breast@@ feeding can be pro@@ secuted .

there are many graphical tools to compare it . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contributions could be made , and at the same time corrected a lot of changes . another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts with mer@@ ging .
the program that was used by me showed me only the altered lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the reg@@ ression has changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in line and modifications to white signs . later , lots of other useful features were added later .
for example , if you want to compare this text to a fast text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into an adequate file @-@ browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of co @-@ work and changes to changes . in this editor you can even edit the result of conflicts and shows the result of an expected result . in this editor you can even process the result into three Qu@@ ell files at Mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the same and merge folder . this screen photograph shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in conjunction with the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the accurate differences and be@@ ti@@ fies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , you can see at a glance at the Sum@@ mary in the column on the left @-@ hand side . ( no trouble longer , if Any one changes the returns . )
if one file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the color indicates that file is different . the red color means that both of them differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can easily get the fil@@ en@@ par@@ work by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder , folder 2 folder , folder 3 folder , folder 3 folder
opening dialog allows manual installation of fil@@ en@@ ames , select a selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or the selection of the most open@@ - opened file from the opening list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file . if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files .
about the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or merge of folders will be initiated if you select a file , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if Mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for the purpose and can process itself . however , it is not necessarily necessary to determine immediately an output file . you can also get this step later when saving .
the set button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before you start playing with the same / merge .
sometimes you would like to compare only a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the intermediate shelf into the active comparative window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select the dialog with the breaking button .
you can also use Zi@@ p and Ab@@ bot : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from a editor and let it fall via a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains more similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would only be able to create two corresponding files , and then compare it into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the fl@@ ashing of text is supported in a comparative window .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and laying of text in another program as cut and inser@@ ts ( instead of copying and inser@@ ts ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Each Info line has a time to rest on line . then a small relief window will show the full name . )
the three sources of the spring are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a color blue , B color is green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees the color , which file differs . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is well shown in the next section ( Mer@@ ging ) .
left alongside the text is the combination column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments concerning the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the merge column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line will be pump@@ ed at broken lines .
the result window ( below comparison list ) has also a info line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; hits &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it does not contain text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts dis@@ band@@ ed , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jumps to the next redeemed / Hungarian conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative levels are used , each difference must also be solved at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is shown in all windows , and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump of the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group is not visible . ) This group is highlighted with color background colour for current field and each on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes the automatic merge tool is left more in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the boxes . this text is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you will change your opinion , and perhaps a different source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark you might copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; coll@@ ision configuration ; however , if you copy this text from the outcome window , proceed carefully with this feature .
note : if your sources select the options described above or Ig@@ nor@@ k@@ C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or commentary are also treated like white signs .
this will navigate mainly with image @-@ running and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons on the left , right , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . click here to navigate to the navigation use .
in the Aug@@ mented window you can also use the other buttons to do pane . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the cl@@ adding columns , synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already described in the section and the ed@@ itable output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Figure For@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l picture down@@ wards / C@@ tr@@ l picture above ) or to the next / previous conflict further than conflict . therefore , between sol@@ dered and uns@@ ett@@ est conflicts has to be distinguished .
to copy the markings into the intermediate shelf , you will need to copy the button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is activated , what is always you to mark , automatically copied to the cache file and the manual copying . be careful because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the intermediate shelf .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ue are stored according to the basic operating system . UNIX variations are using a line @-@ in de@@ formation system \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use motor circuit \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserves the line of the source file , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and will be restored to the next start . ( menu In@@ side &gt; Car@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog can also be programmed with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences will be displayed in descri@@ p@@ tive writing . if the chosen scripture does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ger@@ ast@@ ated . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically an un@@ just color .
when this option is activated , then the Tab key is inserted the respective number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press or press Return , the retro@@ fit line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , any selection will be copied automatically into the intermediate rack . the manual will then copy into the intermediate rack .
you can choose which Z@@ eil@@ ing type you prefer to store . the default value is the usual choice on the used operating system .
when compar@@ ing files tries to find &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be found in the source file . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step , white signs can &apos;t be ignored . similarly , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ sign &apos; \ &apos; . usually igno@@ res &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car back@@ stage , but then they could be displayed on different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , although this option is enabled , but when this option is enabled , this option has to be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result , the differences will still be displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is de@@ activated in default . changes in commentary are treated as changes in white characters .
looking for smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the auto @-@ re@@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before going to the next un@@ ti@@ led conflict .
automatically dis@@ sol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions of voters A / B / C for all uns@@ killed white conflicts from the mer@@ ging menu . note that the automatic selection also may include conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ k@@ C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are described in the chapter on scanning of folders and passing a merge operation . look for details in documentation to the directory comparison and merge operation .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already such a back@@ pack file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not concern the current program . you need to finish and re@@ start the change . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is stopped globally through the control centre . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries will be used for the upper setting .
over the selection fields for the coding appears a short notice , what the local code is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this is influenced how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file can be selected individually , even files can be compared with different coding .
if you have a file processed , you can define what coding is to be used for storing .
if you define supply commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output commands .
turn this down to supp@@ ress Her@@ af@@ ations of changes in white signs in text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in figures or comments if the options ignore the numbers or modify Ig@@ nor@@ k@@ C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you want to compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences in a color @-@ coded trans@@ code column will be shown . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ C ; C , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C is indicated in addition to the normal still a second column column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
the comparison window lines next to each other or above . this can also be useful for ads of long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes , consider the differences and decide in@@ ab@@ rupt@@ ly the files combined . a simple click starts to merge the merge command and use the file name of the last source file as a pre@@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ start the merge command , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
in reading a file it will first hand over this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which can precisely use your needs , or to correct the reverse .
reading a file , it is given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command was given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used solely when ordering . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly corresponding to your requirements . every input line must have a corresponding edition line .
the idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when setting up the diff @-@ results . however , an external program requires , and most users want to do it themselves . the good news is , however , that in most cases S@@ ED or per@@ l is sufficient .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to include automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ dat@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Files \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Files \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Files \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Files \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ \ _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experiment@@ ing with S@@ ED , you might get to understand it and perhaps you may appreciate these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ . S@@ ED &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character from &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits is not replaced by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform several objectives at one time . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; they are used to separate the objectives from each other . example :
instead of S@@ ED , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / switch &apos; allergy however there are some details different in per@@ l . where S@@ ED \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data based on the normal pre@@ processor will maintain for the ad and lead . further operations are only changing the data that the line @-@ equ@@ ali@@ mus can be seen .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the frequency processor uses the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences in consideration , and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmer must edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge the folder with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... make a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal prior to the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes without it ,
... supports selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and merge of individual files . you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog File .
if three folders will be merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders does not start automatically , do not lead to the merge command , select the corresponding menu input or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , you in@@ forms a small news window with the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared until then .
if the scanning of the folder is closed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folder that has been found during the scan , will be displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - or on the object , or by folding the arrow buttons for your left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sign@@ atories and fold all sub@@ folders with which you can fold up all folders .
if you double click on one file , the file association is started and it appears a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other files , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case , the coll@@ ision action can &apos;t be selected automatically . if the Mer@@ ging is launched , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folder will be considered identical if your whole content is identical . then also folder made the same color . if folders is un@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this colour scheme is based on dir@@ diff . colors reflect the colours of a sheet , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if it does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C does not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such errors exist , the coll@@ ision can &apos;t be started .
... A and B does not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A a folder and B a file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such errors exist , the coll@@ ision can &apos;t be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it destination folder , and when the option directories are synchron@@ izing . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folder . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after bringing copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be merged and the option re@@ activate new file instead of merge . if the files are different , but the same date will appear , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Should such bugs be not removed , the coll@@ isions can &apos;t be started .
during Mer@@ ging , a file is modified after the other . it will show the status column when the merger was successful , and according to other messages , if something unexpected is finished , you should make a final review and see whether the status is everywhere in order .
when set @-@ in dialog the file comparative method is selected , the diff@@ user will display 3 other columns . these contain the number of un@@ fold , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dering conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can select either the selected entry ( file or ox ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ging promotions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three folder mode C , the target is used as a target which is used as a target and used for synchron@@ ize A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check out these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to bring together all the entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the button closure ) to bring together only the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
when contra@@ dict@@ ory data types exist , more invalid interaction exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ts elements . you can select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog window appears with the options pass , sim@@ ulate and break off .
choose Sim@@ ul@@ ating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then take certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge into a single file ) , then opens a merge window ( see the screenshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select the kernel merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a bug , a message and detailed status information is displayed . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you can help you to try the cause of the problem . if you select the program again , or you have the chance to solve a different action for the entry , or to solve the problem in other ways before you continue with Mer@@ ging .
if some entries were set individually , you can see &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and lead them together at the later time . even if the merge updates occurred or not saved . even if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu by &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; Car@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory assistance with these options :
only files that are shown on the indicated model are displayed in the element tree . select the pattern with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; select the pattern : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg . * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default value is * . folder must not comply with this pattern .
files and folders equivalent to this pattern is not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a divider character : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders equivalent to this pattern is not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a divider character : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous produced files will be ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ indicated . )
some file systems have an error attribute in some file systems . this option allows you to select a leading point . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in the default settings .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to the links below . this is de@@ activated in default .
for links to folders : if the option is switched on , the links are covered as normal folder . if the option is switched on , a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a final loop and then cr@@ diff@@ 3 ; free@@ zes off . ) This option is shut down in default .
a complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistic curve . ( the number of sol@@ uble , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ sample ) .
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster to compare the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use it with cau@@ tion . this option is g@@ ging off .
similar to the change of change . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered as identical , if it can be equally big . this may be useful when copying the change of alter@@ ation . please use it with cau@@ tion . this option is g@@ ging off .
synchron@@ izing mode mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was given . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging will be selected so that both folders are identical . this option is shut down in both folders . this option is shut down in default .
if there are differences , instead of bringing the copy of the newer file as action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure , because the other file has not been modified . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ original If an old backup file will be deleted with the .@@ original extension it will also be deleted without any further backup . this option is enabled on the default settings .
normally the folder mer@@ ging side remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can shift the divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn the window directory &amp; text window to turn off the main window in the window box and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare one file via double click . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also use a single file directly from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder .
this status is lost , however , if you want to read the directory : list -@@ menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syn@@ tax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle language &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL is : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by using the protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . hence , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note that this option is only possible with local files . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently available as a viewer viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op begins first always the built @-@ in difference viewer . to launch K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then choose in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part shown from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then it starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part 1 . please note that this does not work if no one of the original files exists . besides , it is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the combination or the compar@@ isons of files is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is comp@@ ile ) there is already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 has already pointed out that it can lead to the program diff@@ 3 out of the diff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and I have learned a lot since I looked into the springs of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go there .
you do not have the program compiled from the sources and configure the configure script not to the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . in the default setting , configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are described first as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as the same . if the Lines is the next to Each Other , this is is , but this is is the case .
the editor you can see any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort has so far too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text , no sr@@ c is left ; no sr@@ c has left ; released and the text cannot er@@ ase . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors as highlighted by differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use a different editor .
many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
in order to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the log @-@ log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; comp@@ ile and install , use the command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE gives you the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and automatic make use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ ile . should however difficulties appear , please tell the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt ) copies into the intermediate shelf and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt inser@@ ts ) add the text from the intermediate position to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to upgrade to these options to update the folder with the function updates . )
there are only entries to show the differences . this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder . if the target folder such files are not already included , they are missing after the mer@@ ging . ( the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version . ) This option is shut down in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are attached to one of the selected buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group . if the lines are already available , they will be removed during clicking on the button accordingly .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a Mini@@ preview of all virtual work areas . it is quite practical to change the running programs on the desktop , to change their size or move it . this works both inside a working area and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications for ongoing applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion can be moved within operation as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on , where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . however , if you clicked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click here to minim@@ ize the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries to minim@@ ize , maximum working area and termin@@ ating .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when clicked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop space . only appears when clicked on an application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
if this field is crossed , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is displayed ; the names of the virtual work areas are displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work areas indicate . it is designated by name , names are provided with ordin@@ al@@ numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area .
if this field is crossed , the background of each working area will also be viewed as a back@@ drop in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty work areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple displays with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; used in a 2x@@ n grid , like P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work areas in a vertical array , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to view the window as symbols or with its content and move it outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and selecting the switch ... allows the dialog box to appear .
at the moment , this can &apos;t be changed in dialog settings . but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you need to login to your system administrator . in this file you need to assign the key win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign value to this file . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can enlarge with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen . this application is interesting for several users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visionary . this documentation is to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optim@@ ised for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the picture that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is described in the following as a select window .
in the standard settings increases &amp; sound ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter such as a mov@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to display a selected image area in the magni@@ fication screen ( select screen mode ) or the surroundings of the display on the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse @-@ line . this is always the default col@@ der ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window , and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and post@@ p@@ one the contents of the magni@@ fier structure . this goes also with the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift ; press or use the M@@ MB ; you can move the screen window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection panel . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain fixed , and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , to copy into a file , to copy into the cache ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the stops of the actu@@ alization was that the required CPU time will go to 0 .
select the Update Rate ( Very minimal , Ger@@ ing , Medium , H@@ och , Very high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , printing , new@@ bies ( with the button document again invite in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ c@@ lei@@ c &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a magni@@ fier to look at the cl@@ amped in a newspaper or a photo . this application is used for different people from research : from the research or artist to the web designer .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter takes a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive strain In@@ scriptions ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and which every mouse click pain . furthermore , it may em@@ ulate the drag with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain which is created when clicking the mouse and thus helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , suffer from pain which are connected to your computer by using your computer , if this is not yet to happen .
to make it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is helping to avoid the mouse when using the mouse , it is against pain caused by the control of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic aid , the result can fall for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movement and leads a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement .
is the intelligent shifting @-@ up , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break when the mouse button is em@@ ulated . move the mouse , wait until the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can run the drag by pressing mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
this limitation period must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click out .
if intel@@ le@@ ak@@ ening is turned on , the shooting process is set off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting for the mouse when the mouse button waits for the mouse when the mouse is converted back , if the mouse is converted due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; support now the click through mouse shift . is this function enabled , creates a slow motion to the left and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . this movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; to move the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ control@@ centre , go on sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider . there is a s@@ ling sound buffer , which you adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please select the respective documentation to find out how you launch a program automatically .
if you set all settings on the values , which were set up when opening the dialog . have already pressed the button application , the settings will be reset to the user &apos;s level when pressing the dialog .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the pre@@ ferences . in particular , the intelligent shifting should be switched off . if you click then to the automatic mouse click , you can later use the intelligent shifting .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds too decrease .
initially you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect . clicking on the neutral components of windows or on a window in the browser window , which does not display a link , does not lead to un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ ily , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse , but also the rolls that come in touch with the mouse .
first , you need to remove the ball . as this happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear quickly if you watch the mouse at the bottom of your mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the Lo@@ ches where the ball was inserted . it can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a shooting was started . if in this case you can use the intelligent shifting system , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation cannot end anymore due to the letting of the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you can use and move a window under another window manager .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is reset by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and places the cur@@ sor into a different place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor place where you want to make it . but you can use the mouse on a neutral field of work if you want to make sure that the mouse is void of un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . safe zones for mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces are the tool@@ bar and the title lines of windows .
I am trying to work with the intelligent shifting , but I do not create it to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can avoid it . it is well possible to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board , to move it into or add any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse button . but there will be some advice here :
do not use the intelligent shifting if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . instead , click at an end of the text area and hold down the switch key , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will result in every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click . then you can just use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but then you can use it for some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use to be installed , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; must be installed in most of the system .
the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers , and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is the mouse button shortly confused . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and which the actu@@ alization of the pu@@ zz@@ led pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be set up so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse is let off . in this way , also the pulling and lay with the mouse can also be carried out .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows a silent user to talk to their computer for himself .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mute users can talk to the computer . the user can choose from a list with the conversation propositions which should be addressed again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photograph ) , enter the order , which is used later for the language output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text box book . you can often choose the text pass@@ words , without having to type in . the text pass@@ words can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photograph ) , define the dic@@ tionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ est . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the word lists using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dic@@ tionary that is therefore only to be recorded in writing words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly evident and essentially contains a input field for the key@@ presses of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you prefer k@@ mouth , you can enter the propositions which you want to listen . each set is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select from this propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry parameter K@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two tickets , language output and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ most and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card ticket , enter the command to call the language sheet . in the select box below the input field , specify the drawing code , with the text being passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two species to pass the text . select the check box when the text will be distributed as default on the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to the language output of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this you will find in the app@@ endix .
if you are using as language service as language service , you will need to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be shown on this page . the kt@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications is a standardized interface for voice output , and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the button passage , or by selecting a text passage in the menu text log@@ book or in the bar of text box books .
with the selection of sounds , the chosen text passage will be directly addressed and inserted in addition to the input field , the chosen passage passage will first be entered only in the input field .
with the second select box of the editing pane for text @-@ related text@@ book , you can define whether the text@@ book book should be stored automatically when closing the editing pane .
with the selection of text @-@ related text@@ book , the book is stored . if you select any changes , the text pass@@ age@@ able book is not stored . select Before Save , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text@@ book book is to be saved .
the site Wor@@ ter@@ most contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wor@@ ding . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection box , you can now choose the currently used dic@@ tionary .
with the buttons on the right on the side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the language in the input field and select the language for the dic@@ tionary .
select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads as the &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads and reads : documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by count the insurrection . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dic@@ tionary to insert the words of written words into the new dic@@ tionary .
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are led together , and how these are weighted .
this option allows you to create a new , empty dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ entered words automatically into the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your voc@@ ab@@ outs in the course of the time .
the main area of the window for processing of text @-@ related books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text boxes are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage , or the corresponding key pendant . if you have chosen a text file book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books can either delete the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a fol@@ dable menu .
the order of text @-@ related text@@ books or text passages can change the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the old and the old ; -@@ button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cache file . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the error storage .
the chosen text will be copied to the cache file . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the error storage .

if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar is used for frequently used commands . the tool bar is controlled by default on the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by mouse click the tool@@ bar to a different place can be moved .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow box in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a mov@@ able pair of text boxes can be displayed under the tool@@ bar . by click on the tool@@ bar left side , the tool@@ bar can be moved to a different location by mouse click .
probably you have not entered the command for the speech output not properly or not fully entered . open Settings ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for speech output on the card of language . ( see setup dialog for Language Learning ) .
Festival is a language edition of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . license permits to use the festival free of charge and distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is believed to be installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to speech is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he does not support the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distribute without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the language output , it is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ eman . the language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must send data on default . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ belts into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to tear the text into ph@@ on@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to ph@@ on@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA on the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax will be glad to add the final sign of the text , so that an additional character must be attached . the full command is therefore more expensive than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sp@@ lay / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data on default .
the language edition of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language services that provides all &amp; kiss ; applications a standard interface for voice output is available . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the language box is performed only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language course as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which is installed in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and naturally &amp; k@@ de ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , text by the calcul@@ ator . there is a list of pro@@ filed phr@@ ases that the user can always be re@@ arranged again .
notice that &amp; k@@ mouth . no language synthesis . on the computer you must have a language synthesis installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start the help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ on ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a modules of existing service , which allows any application to read text on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface .
&amp; kt@@ on ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . users also offer interesting options .
reading of texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the language output is made via the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; used .
allows generation of language expend@@ itu@@ res on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ relief programme .
in the future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language output of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GU@@ I ; configuration and establishment of kt@@ ts@@ d on kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the text of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , with which a text file can be read or partially pre @-@ read .
in addition to Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ on ; subscribe to the list of h@@ tt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / mail@@ .com / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you start &amp; pick up ; you &apos;ll need to install the program disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
for the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as there are no actors , the card ticket will appear . see also . if you have set up at least one user , the card card is General . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ izer offer various languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that are distinguished in volume or speed . a well @-@ equipped combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed is known as a speaker . you should at least use a user before you use &amp; kt@@ on ; otherwise use the speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher than the standard driver .
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer @-@ long plates for the same printer .
if you click on the cardboard box in the file size , the card box is displayed automatically , and it will then be automatically set when you start kt@@ ons , and is still not a speaker .
all speakers are already published in this list . the preferred actors appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application has no subject .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speakers from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a click on the list where you click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line next to the bottom . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ system .
choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a junk@@ ies and girls to choose from .
if you click here , click on the new speaker on the card level speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click on Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ on ; you can already use it . go back to the card box and check that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can read &amp; kt@@ on ; use to read text . click on the ticket orders to create and manage text applications . see .
if you have set up at least one user , you can start the voice transfer system from &amp; k@@ de ; start to open the card box in order to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ system to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this is successful , the ticket orders will be displayed and read . see the mark , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if the t@@ sm@@ o is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ on ; continue , if the box is dis@@ able ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) it is crossed .
if this check box is marked and the table size appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read has been completed .
with the buttons in this row , you can start writing orders , stop , stop and return .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; check @-@ in rack or open a text file to read . you can also replace the speaker for one order .
click on the user or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the ticket orders are only displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the board box and enable speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text that is read to read , and start reading the text menu . after a short time , language output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ones and other un@@ visible brands are also read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the displayed text . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that should read read , and start reading in the main menu Tools text . then the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of the mentioned events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ on ; read the text of this news .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up several types of messages , for example , if you notice a message in which your nick@@ name comes in . with &amp; kt@@ on , you can then read the IR@@ C news archive .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry al@@ erts in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter to correct translation offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong @-@ stressed or faulty messages to correct . the file mail@@ n@@ r and b from the messages sent to the e @-@ mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since this can be accepted as provided in most cases than provided .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; they are not required for normal work with &amp; kt@@ on ; filter does not require .
in filters , text is edited , before he will be sent to the mask disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful to improve pron@@ unci@@ ation or bre@@ vi@@ ations to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a text works . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs from four types of texts .
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ axes has the highest priority . it is set up on all other orders and holds these orders . if the edition of the screen Reader has been read , the previously held orders will continue .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and plain text . these orders will continue after the output of the warning .
news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that uses messages . while you are looking for a long text on a web page , you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone &apos;s looking at the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you can address orders placed by the ticket orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that uses text applications . text applications are intended for the issue of longer texts that have no particular dr@@ ills .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a reading , this issue is stopped and finished .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen @-@ v@@ eins . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text applications , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future , there can be even more types of filters .
substitute parts replaced parts of a text by other text . ordering parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ on ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined character filters like : - ) by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
you may send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice on the board ticket , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these various filters can be set @-@ up rules after which it is applied to a language output . if the filter sets , its rules are not applicable , he continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ on ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up in the list below . the editing is carried out in the order from above down@@ wards .
this is the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be operated from above down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and you will see the following setup programs below .
for setting strings filters , you will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions . if these samples are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the respective replacement text . large and small friction will not be considered compared to comparison .
specify a name for your filter . you can choose this name at any time , it &apos;s only necessary to distinguish themselves from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the shown order from above down@@ wards .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter will only apply if the user speaks for the text order one of the languages registered . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the button to hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key .
here is a value entered , the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can use multiple programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run programs will be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be we@@ aver@@ ted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 is displayed , you can only copy cop@@ ete .
the default filter filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen App@@ ly filter when all input fields are empty , the filter can be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing off regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; box ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions installed , you can add it to the di@@ alog@@ ues or edit # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ary &amp; # 160 ; expressions found in am@@ big@@ gen .
&amp; XML ; -@@ trans@@ duc@@ er translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ form@@ ations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , even x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker optional filter , you can send text to a certain speaker that is set up on the card ticket , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can define for example that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text comes to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is provided by the speaker characteristics , which gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the characteristics of the speaker , select the speaker , select the selected speaker .
here is a value entered , if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; box ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to illustrate the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired filter conditions here . if the text is fulfilled the above filter conditions , the user is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your microphone settings or to delete all settings .
the speaker utter filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the case of di@@ ct filters . you have to apply at least one condition .
the language issue API , by &amp; k@@ de ; who can give the programmer their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language synthesis of the K@@ TT@@ SD is added , so that &amp; kt@@ ts can use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice API of &amp; k@@ de ; . full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( h@@ tt@@ p : / / s@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for speech @-@ function via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program ct@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option to read language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can :
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ window . start to start a window in a window , then clo@@ ak in the other .
none of the named language learning supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have prepared the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ switching the filter , but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able doesn &apos;t work at all . you have to do this if you do not use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and installed via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences ski@@ pped or only chew@@ eth @-@ cat@@ fish . what can I do against it ?
make sure that the option is set on the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , may this possibly be fixed by a character set filter . see .

to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ on ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the pack@@ ets of c@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; Dis@@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source files from &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can get from the source file for k@@ de@@ pl@@ bility or download the tar@@ ball every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; pick up , check first if you work @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher with your language synthesis right . to do this , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ on ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ons , which is used to use the program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program t@@ ms@@ gr is supposed to be developed so that the use of a @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will be de@@ composed into individual phr@@ ases . the user can res@@ cin@@ d sales or drop off , repeat , hold the issue or break off .
if an application is sent to &amp; kt@@ on ; if you have set up the attributes of the preferred speaker for the issue . if you have adapted a speaker , the language of English and whose sex is female , this is automatically the best appropriate speaker . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokesman will see you in after .
if you click on the ticket pe@@ aker to add or click on the list , the card is displayed in the list or click on the Edit menu , as an example will be shown in the following the establishment of the module for festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found here .
enter the path into an exec@@ ut@@ able festival program . when the P@@ ath to Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
select the drawing code for text that will be handed over to festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this attitude is automatically performed . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 will be used to use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sliding lines , adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controllers , and display these grey , the chosen voice can &apos;t be selected by you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices will need to be loaded for several seconds because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded already at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) is the first set faster .
if this check box can &apos;t be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or have to click on the application ) .
this check box is marked at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window . otherwise it is visible after the start only the icon of the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the symbol in the system segment to show the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ ops still does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or modify the opportunity .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of order , the number of propositions and the just working set . the speaker ID is equivalent to the column ID on the card type speaker .
with the buttons in this row , you can use sat@@ a in the assignment that is selected in the list below , advance or go back . ( but not every order is made up of several sets ) .
with one click on OK all changes from the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken over and the table size is reduced to the symbol in the system segment . then click on this icon to show the program window .
if the sound system &amp; works is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and administered . issues of Screen Re@@ axes , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . additional information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ on ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ on ; either without support for the appropriate audio module comp@@ iling or comple@@ mentary ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ coding for the audio output is to be used here , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module . have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device here . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal speaker speed . thus these settings can be converted , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on the user to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ on ; -@@ system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
on this card card you can set special actions which will always be executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is set up on all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen Reader has been read , the orders received will be resumed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and plain text . these orders will continue after the warning of the warning .
news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks News . if you are looking for a long text on a web page , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone can welcome the space .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ es long .
this audio file will always be played if a normal text order will be interrupted . if both the introductory sounds are active as well , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message .
the settings on this board map are only valid for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and issues of screen @-@ re@@ ches there are no special actions , if these are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
in order to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; check out the Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ t@@ sm@@ allen and click on al@@ erts . the card card noti@@ fications is published .
mark this check box to activate the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; corrected noti@@ fications . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications if a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ on ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentions your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
all events that are otherwise stated in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ res .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , voice speed , the volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for the control of the language of ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard stimul@@ us , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch will not be set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and sat@@ ile En@@ lar@@ gement filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , the first set can be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also jump on the ticket orders a full post or ski@@ p , even if the language is not supported directly .
here you see the Sat@@ z@@ Lim@@ its filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ of detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings , or add further sat@@ ile En@@ lar@@ gement filters , but you will get rid of it .
the easiest way to learn language selection by try out . turn on the ticket selection menu , which speakers &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection has changed . to this end , you have to set up more than one user , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts , then can start with reading , since only the first set can be processed , and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can stop or cancel changes in the cart@@ on card , even if the language is not supported this function .
for these reasons , the normal sat@@ ile detection filter is automatically set up when you start a t@@ s@@ gr@@ . for the first time . it can &apos;t be dis@@ connected , only be removed . do not change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
sat@@ ile limits filter compare the text with a regular expression of pun@@ ctu@@ ation and include a table sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) on the proposition limits are automatically removed from the text . note that the default value detection filter will retain the dra@@ fts .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( cold ) , war@@ nings , news , or the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the normal rate @-@ limit filter , you can insert this again by adding the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file and the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the ticket speaker sel@@ ector , you can over@@ write the microphone settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the default speakers ( the top one on the card level speaker ) . in other words , no speaker properties are specified .
use of the appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is most likely to the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selected buttons .
here , select the properties of the desired microphone . if this property does not play a role , do not give any role .
mark this check box , if the property is to have priority before other features . you can also set several markings here .
as the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue , it is always treated as a prime feature . you &apos;ll be able to specify this property . if you know , you may need to specify the attribute you might want to specify a specific application in another language when they are introduced in the environment .
to use all the features in the area of actors , which is to clear the following passage , click on the template button standard and then use speakers who is most likely to follow .
in this case , 0 is set for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number is the input 0 ) .

I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but ct@@ t@@ sm@@ gr this voice doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ach@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as guidance , you can also serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card box audio there is a setting speed . thus , the program SO@@ X installed and will be able to comply with the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ os such as Festival Interactive can offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , this activity is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( that &apos;s how it is controlled by the HTML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are quite bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ s@@ the filter , and set up the microphone speed .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts at the audio output . if your system counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and then read a text if you start a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem you can find on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , the code does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read .
the audio program SO@@ X is used for the general adjustment of the microphone speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages . in many voices you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch .
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to limitations on passing .
this voice uses the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early develop@@ mental stage . if you set up the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you want to set up the Russian vote , you need to use the _ ru _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) code like the KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . search for the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the flag must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use Russian voice , option coding needs to be set to 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ Syn@@ thes@@ izer . then takes the le@@ x@@ ic@@ ic analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated from this the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ Program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; c@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , one module for the &amp; k@@ control@@ centre , which enables the management of the network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control@@ centre , allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings over a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ centre , can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ control@@ centre ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ conf ; to make the user a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ control@@ centre ; displayed . module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be accessed by selection of k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; network networking settings in &amp; the menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not installed . physical devices and their drivers have already been working @-@ installed and configured , that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and setting up the network characteristics .
in most cases device drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing and set up . network devices will be added later , the drivers will need to be loaded by changing the following files , according to the kernel version .
the module network settings will be charged , if the option is selected in &amp; k@@ control@@ centre , index . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this system is trying to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform can &apos;t be recognized , the final selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release of it . by selecting the setting of non @-@ again questions the setting can be taken permanently . in the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are shown grey , which means the settings can be considered , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you will proceed by clicking the button mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . by the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button 1 ... in the dialog device must set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings shows the dialogue with further possibilities .
with the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are made by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings will be used for the system at the same time . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP Server will be required . in the sel@@ ective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with selecting Manu@@ ally , the TCP / IP address can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alize the network interface at bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialogue are displayed as properties of the device in the box list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ tra , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off after need . switching a switched off network tool by selecting from the list and click on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off . turn off a activated network device by selecting from the list and click on the interface .
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ ways .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface to the network , where the gateway computer is located , must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the appropriate IP address . it is necessary to understand because computer can only understand IP addresses . if the computer h@@ tt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is required , then it sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine for the name resolution part of the horse@@ man name resolution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS items may be placed through selection of a contract and running or down gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons on or down in the priority .
by clicking the button adding ... from the group machine to name resolution , a DNS server may be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and add the button adding the button . the entry is then added to the list .
from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit menu .... It is displayed the Edit pane .
the list is acknowledged by well @-@ known calcul@@ ator / IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , completed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list of a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . these are still available in the Test version of IP , in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click on Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add . when the known computer has multiple Ali@@ as name , de button Add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box is displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings used in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is h@@ tt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source file .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the rpm package to download and install in one &amp; account ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool with a graphical surface like k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages of libraries and other things are needed .
this is only advised to comp@@ ile users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf will be discussed ; alter@@ able configuration files will be discussed .
this area can &apos;t replace more stringent knowledge about IP networks . in this Annex , only fundamental information about the integration of the PCs are medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . it has never found large spread . IPv6 is expected to pass through the near future . therefore , this description is focused on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge , which is IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to be used or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used or if available , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily .
when w@@ aging your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded during the internet , therefore your application is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up one Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 through 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are based on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP transmission .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files containing from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf may be affected , where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections another content is defined as specified there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by using the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state can occur as expected .

alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button to select the variables file and select New ... select C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
specify the name of the variables . you can also choose one from the list of the most used environmental variables ; click on the arrow next to the box for the variable names . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the coming program to another as the normal address
as in the preparation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored .
to cut a variable , first select the variable variable . go then to edit .
to copy a ambient variable , first select the variable variable , then go to Edit copy .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to insert a ambient variable , first the option must be cut or copied . first , option In@@ sert at all available . select the variables file . go to edit variables .
to change a variable , first choose the variable variable . go to Edit Change .... alternatively , you can select with the right mouse button to the variable and modify ... Select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O . it appears then the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable .
to delete a ambient variable , first select the variable . go then to edit .
in order to activate or de@@ activate a ambient variable , select it , and place the state with the menu item editing pane . with a de@@ activated variable , it appears in description disabled .
alternatively , you can also select with the right mouse button to select the variable , and select it . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
when all tasks and environmental variables have been entered or changed , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are then active .
it appears the Standard @-@ k@@ de ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose off , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system is printed . this option is only accessible to users who have extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the users .
a PO@@ S@@ IX con@@ formity &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to learn about time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first object was to store multiple files on a tape . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you are guaranteed ?
before a band can be used , it must be connected by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; set the tape back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the tape on the tape is not , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the procedure , it is looking for the right index on your disk . can &apos;t be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive , to indicate that the band has been involved . in the status bar there will be a corresponding message . the content of the tape can now be searched for folding the entry into the tape .
before dis@@ card the tape , first the integration of the band must first be solved . there are three methods to evaluate this .
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives an amendment to the tape for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a message in the status bar . the band can now be un@@ mounted without risk .
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format .
one band cards must be form@@ at@@ ted before you need to be used to store data . this process does not correspond to form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drives must be form@@ at@@ ted before you are form@@ at@@ ted from the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; it usually requires a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , D@@ AT drives , however .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all the data on the tape are lost ! after the end of the process , the band will automatically be involved and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . it will only ensure that file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files listed in the profile will be secured .
mark files in local file @-@ tree with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and choose the Zi@@ p Menu ...
as soon as the backup was initiated , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box provides backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be selected to select the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are examined .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the check process has been launched , the dialog box for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work@@ load for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking the check , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of testing the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remainder of the time .
before you can re@@ produce the playlist , the files that are to be recovered will be tagged . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose the menu .
once the re@@ building process has been started , the dialog box for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the work@@ ings for the restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears to restore . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remainder of the time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file from the bandwidth of the band content . this process will delete all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ generate the index on two types of the band :
by this , a safety profile is created with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile :
the current work folder , where the backup is to be done . the list of the secured files will be updated automatically according to the just selected working folder .
for all folders which are listed under the backup files , only the files found therein are on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folder that lie on other file systems can be deleted separately under backup files . each entry will be viewed from tar ir@@ respective of the others .
to determine an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files secured themselves since then .
the name of the file , which is used to establish changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this ensures that all files are backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
settings can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ v version of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmit &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved in loading the drive . for some drives , this is necessary , before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; it &apos;s possible to un@@ lock the outlet for tape drives . possibly , this setting does not work for all band @-@ drives .
if the option is switched on , the delete will automatically be selected at the delete of &amp; k@@ dat ; you will automatically use this option for flo@@ ppy streams .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ ter file size for the tape drive . not all drives support batch sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the log @-@ size for your band drive is required .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , with the name of the complete name of the system it is form@@ at@@ ted on which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the time in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are purely tar archives created directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not in@@ complete back@@ ups .
check the contents of a securing association . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer suitable for systems protocols . the program is for un@@ experienced users that can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables you to get information about your system or where the system enables quick access to information on issues that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; helps users understand what your calcul@@ ator is in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ecos@@ ystems ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is deposited on the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ecos@@ ystems , experienced users access fast access to information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; therefore tries to provide some extended functions which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files specific programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different kinds of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screen picture , &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; functions are available , with the help of the single protocol @-@ lines to be easily fil@@ tering and sort out . the individual options for s@@ orting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol is opened , and it opens up instead of its a small news window , so you will find &amp; ks@@ ystem log@@ log . the protocol files can normally be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user normally no justi@@ fication for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to fill in the filter bar . in the default settings , the select box will be displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line is only displayed if in any of the columns the string of the filter search engine is included .
you can also select another entry in this point . the string of the filter search engine will then be selected only with entries in the appropriate slot . therefore , for example , in the filter bar , select the name of one process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; all protocol lines which were sent or created .
this option is enabled in the default settings and helps you to detect the important protocol @-@ lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed using a noticeable color as the protocol @-@ lines of the level error . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines can be shut down dialog .
if you want to show certain process ( for example in the System Prot@@ ocols or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you want to examine the output of a given command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can turn the option to the new lines in the context menu of the main window , to show all new to the upcoming protocol @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate sub @-@ bars . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows . once you select a window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; has its own website on h@@ tt@@ p : / / ks@@ .@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software e.@@ g D@@ ort you will find more information about the source sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem log ; can also be found in the following folders of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ ystem log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section performs some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly developed to the standard for control of the programme starts at the start of the system in der &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it &apos;s easier to use , more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( other things because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ aries is below / s@@ bin and not below / etc . it is therefore important because somebody could try to take a machine on system V In@@ it without any re@@ install and new format . therefore , you have to be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was a one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you would like to start the system or change to another lap level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , h@@ tt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things as set@@ serial / etc . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use of it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit of doing something with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds it .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre@@ set run@@ level 3 is . if you &apos;re changing it , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab of hand and change the 3 . be careful if you have something through them , then get it manually by re@@ start the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you &apos;re going -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder there are no correct files . instead , each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written that there is an argument like start@@ up and stop . you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the h@@ tt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it includes a K , the script will stop with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running running , the only h@@ tt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . moreover , I also could have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index finger is simple to say that it is tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stopping ) .
you can shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or modify the position within a level by removing it elsewhere . thereby , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or his position ) , this happens if they pull out an entry from the area of availability .
note : entries will be postponed if you select them in a new section . to copy them to a new Run@@ level , you need to select directly from the menu edit or from the context menu , and even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion .
the s@@ orting number of a single entry cannot be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you need to edit the s@@ orting numbers of the resulting entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there are no possibility to restore entries in the paper boxes . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the different work@@ areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below previous data .
to post@@ p@@ one entry into another lap @-@ level , move it into the intermediate position ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired race level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the s@@ orting number or the name of a single entry , press the input button to switch to the properties dialog . use the dialog button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw out the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before being executed .
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise , changes to the pre@@ ferences are stored in a local sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
at the li@@ lo - Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard running speed on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you &apos;ll need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the species , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration of the proprietary integration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please verify that all configuration files are required ( and even if they are located in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or h@@ tt@@ p@@ d ) simply stop without a message when your configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can be even different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information on Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; c@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you made changes , you need to save them . either you use the respective icon of the tool bar or the entry store in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two postcards , the user and user group list . to edit the user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are only displayed if you have enabled the constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users enabled , a cart@@ on card can be made on which you can make individual settings . other cards appear if shadow pass@@ words or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card system pass@@ words appears if shadow pass@@ words or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if for at least a embedded fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable to the quoted a.@@ s / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , for every user parameter , each user can be modified , each data can be found in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the help of the field file system .
the board map groups inform about the group height of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , you will find a prime group in the field . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by selecting this in the big field .
the group features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select adding to the user or group or click on the matching drive button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the li@@ lo @-@ boot manager , remove the bo@@ g word , remove and change the time until the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
