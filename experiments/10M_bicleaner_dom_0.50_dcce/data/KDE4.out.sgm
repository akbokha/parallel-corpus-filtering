<seg id="13">The module & conditions view; for & Konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME-type Iode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text messages to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & fsview; it is to portrayed with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. Tree-Maps allows the display of the size of objects in broken structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size doesn't have to have the capacity of the lower objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">Near & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. according to this way, large files can be easily detected even if they are seen far below in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & fsview; as an interactive and interactive version of the & UNIX, command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap-representation a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your file system. to simplify navigation use the rectangles meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on colour mode, can be either a depth for the light detection of the disclosures or the figure of another file system such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various qualities of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature you can determine if sufficient space is to be used or if the area of subordinates are to be used (where to act bowel error by constraints during the sign of treemap). in addition, you can define the relative position of the labeling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With intestinal algorithms for Treemaps, this target should not always be met. during the Treemap in & fsview, this goal is not always met. it will be drawn in order to enter the subject of the entries. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result of the area of a single entry for the subordinates, the implementation will be left up. here it is intended for the reproduction and avoidance of space losses due to the frame that the tangles are created, the best methods of that are classified as possible. the best methods on this are lines, columns or recursive.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimal amount of space for an entry on the menu entry. instead, a rounding pattern is drawn into the area of the higher part, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an undercut entry.</seg>

<seg id="56">& digiplug, contains a fast image processing with basic editing tools. you can use these to view your photographs, comment, evaluate, and correct. the working skills can be easily extended with KDE image plugin interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digiplug has come; it is easy to use, it offers dozens of professional abilities. it works completely in the 16-bit colour space and all available modules support the shell conversion by libraw, DNG-export and ICC-color degradation workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; on the camera or lens that can be sought.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digious; an open source project. that means, it is on the support of the Endanese government. you should therefore report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digious; tries to make the signal from problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible. if you use these links, your web browser opens one page in error correction system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to retrieve your review.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digious came; is a project which is supported by a community. if you come to join a regular user of & digiplug, then we would like to answer any questions about other users of & digiplug. in this mailinglist, however, you should be mentioned in English, you should be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiders; homepage to visit the news about released versions and other information about & digious; find out.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digiplug, is the registration in the developers-mailing list. guidance to contact in the developers-mailing list of & digious;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & finish, you'll be asked if you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote file. just enter a name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data transfer is stored. this path remains the same for all image scanners.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add a lot of folders such as you want. & digiplug, you will also use as an alumlibrary. digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, which contains pictures, as the base folder. & digiplug, consider any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator as shown in the folder:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digious; durst rebates the librarians in its entire depth. you can't shut down your subfolder, unless it comes in hidden folder. this can you get extraordinary & digious folder; get rid of a point before the name of the folder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList can't take photos as symbols. you can change them by taking a popular photo taken from the album and then use it on the folder icon. this will then be used as a Albumicon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera; then you should learn how to use My albums and My keytelet to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact & Flash; memory card and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the camera can also be implemented as a record transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug, uses the program gPhoto2 to communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is also a free-free software collection for digital cameras, which was developed constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 supports the transfer of pictures of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for your communication with the calculator. since photos in generally large files are outdated and transfers over the serial port is slow, this connection is supported and leads the transmission of images with gPhoto2 through. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support to read reviews. if the card support is not present in libgphoto2, you may have predictive images that might be impossible or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digious; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugin interface Project (manual) is a approach to develop a common module structure for & accessories. the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need not to find more than 1000 photos on your computer. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you do not use & digiplug guarantees very fast search and secure filing on which you can access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you need any kind of your system is the setup information structure in contrast to the data structure. you need to decide whether other access to your photos will have to save them on a reservoke drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Perhaps you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly beyond your location. if you're doing enough photos, then you will be signatories such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; can then export a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures on different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% job files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of data types makes the pile processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata into the file page of metadata in & digiplug. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can then select the metadata from the database into the files by choosing the corresponding item in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? in addition, the digious editor is available for a number of selected attributes. of course, these are the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you need to assign to each photo words, labels and an assessment. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute, and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best pictures for further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's go with keywords, key words, as you are often called on other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import Catalogical pictures from another source with embedded enchanters, then you will paste the images on the right place. the outline of the Hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by adding a sub-tree to another. the modified tags can be followed by & digi; updated while it pursues the undertrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overtaken. this is a very rough representative as each block of metadata is made of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the key words - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool for cataloguing your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most don't want to let you see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to find your photos arriving.</seg>
<seg id="163">Check out this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it, you begin to see some details, people, the square.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing is. Wow! it starts to dream, associations, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. the label has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest. when you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning of the viewer to help Him about the motive you move that you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's ok, if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a labeling for themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can contact you as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), when you export your pictures in Web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your labels and / or the title of Web-geriessystem. so you do not have to tell the story for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use Geolocalisation are already innumerable and are able to get deeper into the future. I also am sure that one day, in the near future, you can easily browse your travels with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures at the recording venue. you can also export the pictures at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of removing copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms shall apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information was found in the setup page of & digi; as information is deposited in information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonymous with writer and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it was not desired to protect the name of photographers, then the name of a company or organization can be used. after which this value has been saved, it should not be changed. this field does not support coma or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autograph (synonymous with author): associated with the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples for this may be the title of a photographer, freelance photographer or more independent commercial photographer. since this is a merk to the author field, this also must be filled in.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the bideter field to identify who offers this photo. if the photographer is working for a News Agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organisations can be listed here if the picture is a bearing picture, then the group / agency will offer the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this can do no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than base knowledge in work with calculator can modify or modify the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important for professionals and semi-professionals.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug, in the near future, will provide such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnouts, plate loss, blackout, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterpreventive, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have lost on the street or a fire. these type of losses are the same that you can also happen in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section it concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroell Ontrack, the biggest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that has a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these preferences must be treated more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. of course, you can claim CDs and DVDs in archiving quality. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. if you think that is in your detection area.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good disks and good recording tools and keep them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it turns out to choose the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to error, even if you were just written only. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical aging, ultra-violet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a good program called Isobuster that seems to make signs of CDs and DVDs. but there is also similar applications available for Macs. there are also similar applications which can read damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to gain the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device to qualitatively high-quality media in a non-propriated format. you should also check out the media with a description, date & author characteristics and then on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected spot. don't forget to copy the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware and software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Dismanufacturers reserve your statistics for themselves. their production guaranteed include a new Disk, but not the data. Google will provide a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives: dismissing</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most frequent error rate, SMART can not determine these errors immediately. some of SMART demonstrated these errors immediately. these are especially reading bugs and publishing teeth. the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a current failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually come again without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical appliances do not make a lot of power, it looks different from devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these anomalies can damage these anomalies, complete data loss, hardwarning and other defects, so protect themselves from the inevitable part of a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power tips is an overvoltage protector. this is a device that is absorbed by a part of energy-heat and the rest is grounded. it is usually in the form of a connector bar. remember that not any plug-in is also included in overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should consider that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also consider that it protects the protection against lightening and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used on your machine, you should also be sure that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage cables which can also include a telephone connection for your modem. other offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable fashion and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore very small and you can also contain the protection for your modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protector your system will protect your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltage, these devices can be automatically provided with battery power. some models allow you to save your data and run the system. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements such as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifespan of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk of being exposed to your computer system and compare it with the costs to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think about it all cables before you enter the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - an easy storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives, you can cost very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general security solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available online storage services. your free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional variant provides you more at your disposal, in the case of Flickr more. $25 per year you get unlimited memory that should not be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted in the offer and the large number of companies are included in the offer and they are desiring secure.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are due for transmission errors. the file system and btrfs provide for at least the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you say if a transmission error occurred, not when this is done in your hardware. all these errors stay undiscovered until you don't have any protection against it. no one seems to have thought in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable mains parts are a further source of transmission systems as they generate interferences within the data stream. during normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected particularly by transmissions, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates that can handle and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available for this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at working conditions. with Notebooks, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most meiosis, than for instance, theft or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less andue for data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the spread file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the examination process for a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and a definite status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat of digital data: wrong, theft and human error, the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamentally physical limits. it is meant that technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics are far from this limit far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more stringent. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk now get out today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone accounting for data loss. 6% of all PCs are subject to a plan and test this backup before any dangerous like the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of panels, or the size change of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you have to make your sickle on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, you will be lucky when the drive was not connected in the instant.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget about plane accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the whole house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterprevention is still a non-local store. bring your sickle up the stairs into the neighbouring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as above already said is a more common reason for a data loss despite fuse the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that of one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">A complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete system. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete system and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. it creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time at each time. this fuse comes to a versioning system next with the exception that is only partly fasting and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool which allows you to easily set up your machines. unlike the script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer missions Resync only the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase safety beyond ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important pictures right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another opttable medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come to fuse with & lt; 130% of the size of the workfiles. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should have done after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy the images on the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visibility..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is not predictable due to your nature, you'll have to look at it all today. unfortunately, there is no other way to come across as a certain waeliness. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for each. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. stay at open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the subject of a system to change a system in its size. this actually means to increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have completed the scalability with plans and put the area you want to put on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer to a new board:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / MSB [#] of = / dev / MSB, the new record is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is able to read, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier for year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard, but it is much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but it is a relative number of administration information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression has. this format will we recommend to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widespread than picture format. TIFF can store in uncompressed form or stored in a container with lossless compression algorithm. however, it manages images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted from many people. there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed for the need for the need of camera formats. it is now available for a handy camera manufacturers and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, by 2001, Adobe uses the XMP technology to replace & quot; Extensible metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic technology that allows users to embed data into a file. file information are saved with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Lots of photographers pull it off before an original of your recording, mostly in the shell format. XMP wants to store the metadata separately from the image file. but it can be found in the link between the metadatendatei and the image file, and how above already noticeable is the raw format used. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application and business models. to the activities of DCMI, work on architecture and modelling, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and explanatory efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long the pictures are on the camera folder, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Copfiles to DNG and save them in your shell archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for a fine-layer process. if you want to edit the pictures once again with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata. these were cut off the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it then in Webgaleries, add them to MPEG, using in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description, as you can have photos you already on your hard disk, but the camera interface offers you many advanced settings for impose images on your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To connect your digital camera with & digiplug; connect them with the machine, turn the camera to the display mode, and turn it on. another description here you will find in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you launch the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fertig indicator will appear at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for the file association for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the sidebars attributes and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of one entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information which are internally stored on the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. notice that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturing, GPS etc. of the image. these information are the same as with the metadata page from the main window of & digiplug, or image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera to a single record in & digiplug. in addition, the photos will not be deleted from their camera and we recommend you to check whether the pictures are safe in an album before you delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired search methods offered by & kde; select the button download and then select the chosen folder. the button selection can be downloaded here as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, option New to download is available. these pictures have not been selected by & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in front windows. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you can download the buttons all download or searched out, a dialog box will appear in which the photos will be sorted. the list of existing albums will be sorted, how normal folder is sorted, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digio; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all files by clicking the button. if you only want to delete a few, you need to select this manually and delete it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be deleted in the trashings of & kde; you should be carefully inspect whether the photos were successful into a & digiplug. if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete your camera information, you should make this considerably faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for photos frequently are not particularly meaningful names. the filenames can usually lead to double filenames in the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate photos of different recording eries in the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the file was put into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dator-based subslabs. if you use this option, a folder will be created every day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the broadcast opens three more options that are carried out before the photos stored on the plate. if you choose this, the respective entries will be copied to the author in Section Standard Authorities. with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command string.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the opportunity to change the filename in lower case letters, or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera is available in the preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug, can be used all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of view. not all cameras are ready to perform this information. in section page bar metadata, you can read more details about the information which your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually turned on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, the photograph is in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turnaround, use the button Extended and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been updated information about the date at which the photo was made, this subsection is based on the image data. all pictures with the same date will be charged in the same sub-album. not all cameras are available in the same sub-album. in section side bar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores can be switched off. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the button Extended and select there the date file-based subset at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their machine to their camera is the button download. select the file selection dialog & kiss; appears where you can choose the files that are uploaded. you can also choose more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, take & digious; you, where the images are uploaded to your camera. select the folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a common concept in this document. thus, a position is meant that can be displayed in longitude and latitude. identifying the data can be displayed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to combine an image with a precise geographical place. not everyone is using an airplane to cartographic data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can use one click to open the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug, who wants to locate the location of the photos so it's well to refer to the location data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as the direction, saddle and card referencing. it is at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographic mapping (manual) and most of the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera to integrate a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or through transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from a device can be done using gpsman or gpsbabel. however, these data must be saved in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, that can extract and correlate data from images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the curtains coupled coordinates, which are created by maps.1.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digious came; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that can access the behaviour of & digiplug. in order to accept these settings, you must select between these settings. you can change between these settings, by clicking on the symbols of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select promotion can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing can be put on embedded preview site. in order to take the default behavior of & digiplug, click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard candidate and urges legal data. these data will automatically be selected in the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is synchronized in the IPTC fields during downloading.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autograph is a synonym for author: this field should contain the specification of photographers. this field is intended to be a photographer, freelance photographer or more independent, commercial photographer or more independent, commercial photographer. since this is a further description on the author field, this should also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author if this is registered for a News Agency such as Reuters or Associated Press; if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency must be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC field. this is done that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digiplug. these metadata are also available in & digiplug; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images rendered as embedded label (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronized the comments you will add to your photos, with the images embedded in the images. this allows you to include labels in pictures, which are already labelling, these are overwritten by the & digious images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer is in the main window on a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digious came; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats. to determine which data types & accessories came to indicate, you can add the file extensions of this list and remove. any file in one & digib; Albumfolder, which is not any of these extensions, ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button updating a button from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminated area of & digiplug can be set on this page. however, if you are switched on the illuminated table. some pictures have different sizes and the synchronized mode. if you have one, you should use only quick computers. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can choose the tool bar, if you use the tool bar in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colours are set here. in image processing it can be switched on with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling, it is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia towards the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG device, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality since PNG requires any lossless algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can use this value for a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF file option, you can activate the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF pictures. this reduces the size of the TIFF file. it has no effect on image quality, as the deflate algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free settings. even if you were written any lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in the normal JPEG. as this paragraph, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug, the image processing was only a picture-viewer for photos. it is currently developing very fast to create a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard increase is that every green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light than the pixels of odd lines. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 barred pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white off the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic paint balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white is not the same. standard is a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect to get more details in four steps more details in the top-lights. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-noise, so the parts of your images are displayed, due to the inability of your camera to catch the top-lights in the settings. the settings now solve some unusual results as it shows the top light in various roses. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally not satisfy as fast as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing blue and red shares out of the still no saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you will probably have to set him anything higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of the & digiplug. image processing is made too small for the time to try out the conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosatone algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete picture of the particles, which have many cameras and provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or Farbreconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug, and Dcraw are available on three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. according to some tests, it was used as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was used. but it creates color file on the edges. Bilinear is interesting when you are looking for a quick solution with acceptable results.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color of your lenses, you can place the red and blue-corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a colour refusal if you are carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">One profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this. there are also LCMS and & digi.There are also information such as color formations from a color space in the other, so the colors are as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour Questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color module module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profil folder Sing the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / color / or / home / .color / ICC, in which you all save your profiles. & digiplug has examined these folders then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">ICC Profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to leave. everything can be changed to open the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color view is an alternative towards Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera manufacturers and model you can fit. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color or Gammacorrection. currently, dcraw Gamma does not have conversions for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the hue mapping himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are further options like the soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate how your image can be done by one device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could correct you manually instead of the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious that color profile is for them for what is intended for. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the purpose: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plug-in interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; images concerned and image processing is supported. many modules support that are written in order to cooperate with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you want to use and these will then be charged by & digiplug. these modules appear as new entries in the main window and beyond, you will also find some in the context menu of the login menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu on Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be found on the KIPI project under http: / / www.tipi-plugins.org or in the Handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjust the time between image outputs, usually it is 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes are switching on or out, which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera characteristics indicate the list of all supported cameras on the left-hand side. on the right there is a button Automatic detection, which is trying to identify the camera properly, switched on and in image display mode. you are currently here Serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / s, specify which you can attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To connect your digital camera with & digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your machine and turn it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Probiere you see if & digiplug has come; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any number of options for your camera. this is displayed on the main menu of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">Using the confirmation dialog for the debugging of &gt; images in the trash-trash, you can set the talk of & digial; check the recording of a photos in an album. in the paragraphs of a recordings and deletion of a album, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down through & digiplug; applied when you use the option changes to the right side bar without feedback. otherwise, you will need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You may also include the display of the welcome screen of & digious; at the starting start, it will be accelerated under the start-up of & digious;</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting is looking for new photos to look for new photos. it prolongs the basis of the new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the starting time of & digious; when something from the base folder was deleted, it asks; ask if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemas can be used in & digiplug; you can choose to customize the main window onto your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & accessories, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug, contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image processing can be started by one click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug. so, you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules can be set up in the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge and including the tool bar for fast access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing features of the image processing changes your photos. however, you will not change the original photo before you save File Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the image file, or use the button The button Reconment of the image processing reproduce in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image processing can be reversed or recovered. the last action can be reversed by selecting the editing or remodelling, by selecting the editing menu from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the keyboard-shorter, ctrl; -z to reverse, and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; over the back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are also restored or restored accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image, or the entries in the menu file. if you've made changes on the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse bike or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you can also view the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can change it in the settings dialog box & digiplug. you can also read this in the settings dialog box dialog. see this section for editing the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print the image in the menu image and get the default & box; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sentences. all image scissors can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the pictures using the standard methods and select from the menu album Export assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digious window, the main window has a side bar on the right edge, the important information and promotions for the selected images are available. the same page bar is available without the navigation components, even in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders are clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab, the side bar will appear or disappear again in the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter labels with unlimited size or insert. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- Fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling system in other applications, you should be aware of these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After which you have commented, use either the button user or switch to the next image, the fittings are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button there is a button. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. but you can also select the metadata into the files. this will always be carried out if you select a metadata setting, which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorrows. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the side bar or using the button bar. in order to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select these and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field, which follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The key view shows a search box to the filters of the keyword, the keyword, and a select box with the previously applied in this & digiplug session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is adapted dynamically to the entered search phrase. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom ends is a further relief for the input of keyword in a picture series. if you have entered several keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Етикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетикетике</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view, select a keyword in the keyword, this only applies to the original picture and does not apply to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page Toolbar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keywords and viewpoints. if in addition, one or more keywords will be used from the right side, only the cut quantity will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull out keywords and place. suppose you have several images chosen to put you in keyword. if the keyword exists, you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears where you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were removed with Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword from the right jad to choose from and there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place during each start of the program. you can also be switched on with different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would be one or should be, you can easily change this easily with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is being sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the operator argument is the operator, that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extended search over all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouping options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then to use the button. the options are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why did Picasaweb or Flickr are not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I made it mainly to & digiplug; s concrete implementation was adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one is using a colorless workflow, the colours of your camera or scanners will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographers or scanned colors. using a colorless workflow, you can gain the colours on your monitor from your camera or scanners, and those that show you the colors of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know what buttons it must express for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make information on any point of image processing workflows. in addition, links with deeper information is to make your own informal decisions you can get the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workworkflow meets all criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (please find more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditures are by e-mail or web, where the RGB of de-facto is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if my RGB works so well and that makes life for all so easy, why should one use another color space and make your thoughts about hackable ng?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the hufeathite region, and the colors in the RGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour flowers, visit Bruce Lindbloom's site, and then click on info and then on information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor when I decided to work in the RGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in a RGB color space or not, you'll need to calibrate your monitor. if you are working as a color space of sRGB, then you must use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. do not use it before using a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The normalize, identical, Automatically detris and contrast expand from the menu Corrigate Automatic correction will try to test the best out of your colours. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled down the Leustressources about the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without his color correcting. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Equal: this method adjusted the amplification factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity ranges is as flat as possible. so, almost every helical range has the same number of pixels, sometimes it produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation which causes a wonder at a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic equal: this method maximizes the colour area in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusted the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogrammar area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enlarge: this method improves the contrast and luminance of the RGB values of a picture by sliding the lowest and highest values in the widest possible range and a new jiustination of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photographs.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white wine equated by & digiplug; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white off of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The tincere correction is a bit limited since a colour space is done with 8-bit per suit. in case you can do so far from the original sign, areas with overexposure time can be carried out, which works in 16-bit mode so your ways to correct the correction is better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start with the menu input colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window windows can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original sign and the preview of the tool can be adjusted. once you want to see the original language settings, then click on the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram is displayed, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment is capable of improving your photos or down dimmers.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above checks are used, you should use the colour-temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the image preview to select the color temperature of the white comparison chart. this type will also be set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the white off with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure dictator increases the colours when more than a colour channel of pixel overexposed. the combined result is displayed in white immediately. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading precisely this. each setting of the white comparison you have set can then save in a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings make all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white comparison. note that also neutral settings will be shown a different photo as your original. if you save them, your original sign will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust here the coefficient of coding per colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding needs also more disk space, calculating time and is available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG device.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool brings up the same dialog as the processing of carving images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the helpers. a detailed guidance for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find sound error in the menu. this tool presents an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously, so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner should always require the same error and you will always require the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct, is the tool for gradation that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug-effects are four color effects, a solar energy effect, a bicycle effect, a Neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar control, also called Sabatier, was also a effect of the image. the colored, dark sections protected the sensitive photopapier. the result was a partial negativity of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect easy to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase creates a negativity that is not to create photo paper on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original intensity is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaqua; -Effect. it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a balanced color film that is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. this name is a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrast. the characteristics make him a film of choice for natural photography. Velvias strongly satisfied colors are also some photographers, especially of which the hardly landscapes is too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameters level controls the brightness of the result and the shift repetitions. in large images the filter may cut the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not unusual to change the color contours and the lightening of the photos. all your Justices can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the easy replacement strength / contrast / Gamma is the tool sound value based on improvement of exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool is very complicated, you need only the field of sliding only. exactly the three slider beneath the Histoprogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active canals or the selected area. underneath the graph are three slider into the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The simplest way to learn the operation is to shift the regulator and make sure how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview can be updated dynamically, from the image's settings. on the left-hand side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be adjusted if the histogram with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is illustrated. in images the large areas of a constant color does not dominate the linear histogram of a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic entry is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinboards can be used in the preview of the original image, to automatically adjust the input lag of the shade, medium and light tones. furthermore, there is a button for an fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to evaluate the output values. the compression of the output values can be used for example as a background to create while something else can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and later recharged with the gimp level format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color chains, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and Sundays. click on the preview of the original picture to set the input signal for rotor, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposure controls controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on display in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, the half of the original and the target picture is shown. the preview can be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols can be changed in order to change between a linear and logarithmic view. most of the pictures featuring a digital camera, linear mode produces a wide scale. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps in this case.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you postpone a cranventeil to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are correspondingly dark with darker and darker images.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red markings can be seen. if you want to change this marking on the section you want to change the original value. create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you can created can be stored in the filesystem and later recharged. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three colour picking buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, means and Sundays. activate the colour pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the rotor, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposure controls controls all colour channels in order to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white picture that has been corrected in Luminescale. Schatten- and Sundays has been applied with the colour pipette and applied to the curves (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug has come; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colour shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu of channel duct in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selection box, you can choose the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first reference how you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash. the top section of the window shows you a preview of. the original can be viewed by comparison on your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the histogram with you indicate the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and building allow you to activate this channels. if you activate Luminance, you can also activate the option monochrome, as the channel Mixer is a DAS tool for creating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, takes the reduction of a color to a visible noise that comes from color duct. colour space consists of small smoking species which looks not at the same place in the color channel. if that is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion, in which you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposure controls controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on display in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue channel was readjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original picture is under (1) and the modified image below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction capacity. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a step of work, since color images can be easily converted on the machine. also with a set of film profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Restaurant 5 Plus, Ilford PanF plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good, with all scenic images and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. so similar to 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this is improved landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange-filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lentil filter. this creates dramatic celist effects and can simulate lunatic light to daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lentil filter. this is the natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: this creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a little bit of cold in the shadow of water. this is typical for the process of reconciliation of prints and redevelopment in a sepcase. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Cover with the & digiplug; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture on your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry is used for image texture.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the note of the depth or three dimensional ality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied on the photograph below. the original version is (1) and the changed below (2). the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the borders of a stopover is not easy task. it is possible to maintain its attention to the image. this is a psychological barrier for the streuating eye. the module can be used from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired colour type for your image. it rotates with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), drain it with a cute 3-dimensional frame, ideal for a buttoning effect and decoratively add an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: is the width of the frame in percent. the range of value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the frame decorated will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of images, especially if you have used the tool Folding aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text into a picture at any point. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just type the text and place it with the mouse. use text positioning, orientation, color from the color space and the character set. the bigger the picture, the greater must be the character set. finally, select a frame for the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you push the button "OK". after the picture has been saved once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template, you can apply a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture template use in the image processing can be used to put template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. you need to add the PNG file format. if you want to add your template from the & digious file size, simply send an e-mail to the & digiplug; mailing-list of digiBOB-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you set the template on the template. these settings will be announced for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template was put in a glance, which reflects the folder's structure of the template. the selection of a folder will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview, there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the present image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Zoom out: this button shrinks the picture below. it is used to apply the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to postpone the picture below. take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to use the template onto your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">Finally, there are three different tools available for casualties. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for tension. it is very quick and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grained pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unfair mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture more sharply. indeed, it's no little, it works rather psychotuell. you can use it to remove atmospheric pressure and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright of Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is possibly the best of the three because it is really improved the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adapting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. these elements are smaller than the dissolution. this in turn leads to a common color combination. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require any additional sharpening as normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera is often applied in internal casinoculation. pictures in the raw size must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a scopy filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpened a photo with the sharpening promotional train. you can call it with the menu entry correlation.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should hereby be careful because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. generally, you can focus on the menu input Korrigate Refocus. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution, the picture is a little bit soft than it's sharpened. use the tool to mark the softening with the menu entry basket and experiment with settings. the showcase on the right side of the slide shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masks is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help to edit the image. the window showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should be tried out at first. an increase in the radius or contemplation process the effect. if you make the visual acuity too strong, noise and impression of grates are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow bigger radii. you should therefore sharpened pictures best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is set by the percentage between the original and the widowing image one that is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tail-value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. one can thus define a minimum difference to ensure an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft shift between the sounds are excluded and therefore beautifull errors in faces, heavens and water surface are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masquerying filter. the original picture is the (1) and the finished picture (2). unsharp mask has been applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus refocus on an image by improvement of the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected unprotected unprotected filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to convert a picture to & quot; regesierquot; in which it is a technique called FIR Wiener Filing. this is better to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filing. it is usually better to use better results than unsharp masks. you can start it from the menu by calling colours refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular splitting is much better than the Gauß 'break. the Gauge d split has a very long tail, which is far away from the source pixies that are far from the original torques that is far influenced by the remote pixel. most cases also causes severe results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular difolding. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but then in Heiligenshone.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation is able to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rouching filter: an increase in the filter filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values vary from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will still smite the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your visual acuity is auss. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the router filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can be good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. note that the module is very slow when you choose great values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameter is set to be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason is that much operations are not visible immediately, which left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress images, eg; when JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, it produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by this, the unsharp masks a bigger neighborhood is used as a sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it must always produce arteefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never show the effect of visual acuity. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimum Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the visual acuity. the FIR Wiener filter is often better at the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been done with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods for check-in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator of the smoothening sets the unsharpness of the division of the dark, in order to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink enables a customized color for the pupils. if you want a blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most expanded tool, in order not to remove the required artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Intro algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">In order to simplify the restoration works, this tool contains several preferences to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can also use the riders and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed reference p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of details. a small value results in smooth smoother than the image. if larger values, mainly homogeneous regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should be used so that no sharpening should be subsequently necessary. please note that the detailed accuracy will always be subjected to a guideline.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoother evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-gradient or CCD rouches, a high value wl similar patterns will produce. JPEG Artefakte will be best close to 1 value.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p defines the relative difference. put this value as the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes smoother, since it is difficult to create the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbullet effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: if there is often the algorithm run through. usually, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular progressive distance da [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, then there should be small for a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral parts [0,1, 10]: integral pacity in pixels. you should put the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More quality you get by the option of this option is only minimal. it doubles the term. we therefore recommend it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading precisely this. each setting of image errors can be stored into a text file, and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are removed with small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analogous camera. as you see, there is a unique black Artefakt in the foreground, that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is under (1) to see and correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digious spreader is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a protected algorithm created by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filter to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or fashion. effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read it in this tutorial first in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grapous noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the lower settings of advanced settings may remain in the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. great values increase the time the filters needed per pixel and can overcome the image below the picture and the colour in it and adjusted for minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the spacing distance from the filter to the front view to determine the illuminance changes. if it is increasing, the adaptive filter data may not be adjusted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter data may not receive any more space and routing or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy of the filter. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter can be removed or noise tips can occur. put it at a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rouge or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothless process of the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerances of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothless process of the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas that typically become stronger, however, it does not expose the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the alignment of the phasenjitterdamping factor. if it is increasing, the edges are smoothed on variations of luminance density. if it is high, noise and Phasenjitter will appear at the edges. it can remove noise levels and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this. all parameters used for smokers that you have set can be stored in the file system and later charged.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise levels can change your life. the originator is marked with (1) and the correct reduction was applied with the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is a crisp for your purpose. the solution to sharpen a little softly is much easier than a picture to sharpen with the menu entry, and experiment with the smoother. the window windows on the right side of the slide shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digija came; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo file acts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß ', film, compression acts and local mistakes which occur in digital, original or later digitised images, thereby creating the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and textures. the texture is done with a different tool, the image error correction is carried out. the algorithm to restoration work was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labors in Caen / Franndie and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte: the compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas. it creates some compsions & quot; Artefacts quot; - small standards that are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading accurately this. each setting of photo-restoration can be stored into a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce the photograph of a photo with equitars. the module is applied to a black and white picture that with a minolta (TM) 700Si's camera on a Ilford (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 iso. you can see the notorious filmmaking on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures was applied to an old color photo which has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts about the scanning illumination and the photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Site Hotpixel; Tool Hotpixel allows you to remove those with a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem, because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and quot; bright Pixels quot; on a photo with a dark subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard button with the picture dark. the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to correct image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note here that the assistant is watching the last dark image and automatically reload them in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview can help you correct the results in the picture. the window showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preferences.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is measured an average of the neighbouring pixel. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels, having a distance of 1 pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic area (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, taken from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure; the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digipancy chamber; Vignettibility corrections is a tool to correct the vignment, i.e., exposed corners, one image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large size format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetraquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reach the sensor there. telephoto lens may also show this behavior too.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. a lot of center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filters, which should be impossible to keep the camera under way. wide angle lens, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, since otherwise unsharpen effects arise through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalence transformation. the tool Vignettibility correction turns the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the Vignettifier correction filter and control the target image with three additional indications.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lighting efficiency at the point of the greatest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which translates a optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate a larger degree of vignment, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchiller, contrast and gamma-settings: editing the image with the Vignettibility correction reduces the luminance of the pixels. you need to readjust the exposure of the target with these options. the regulator have only positive values for you because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finalization of exposure to the target image, let the values for luminance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; picture machining from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction to a picture. the original picture (1) shows the Vigneting in the corners and (2) the correct image. (1) the correct image and contraindications have also been performed on the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious membrane is a tool designed to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected by copyright algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. colorless distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree is the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or condensed form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third density has a similar compiling effect but flailing at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the degree is corrected the removed corners to the second degree of gravity. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the thickness of the distortion part of the second degree. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion is corrected and positive values of turf-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth density. this value is stronger than change in the edges as in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter set the reverse signs of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled down the image size and thereby lead a correction of the first grades by. negative values increase while positive the image scaled.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this is adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners, while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box with a preview of the error correction. the values you use for your picture will be saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or turquid correction should be carried out prior to all influx or size changes. the best result you can cut this correction as every first. if you make a picture new and then an tons-shaped correction would be the effect of evidently of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you the best correction is to give you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection you can correct the tons / turquid distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a turf-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them from image processing or using the zoom-controller of this slide.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs, e.g. recordings from front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so correct that you hold the camera in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction of a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the correct image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infringement of the GannGuru's website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared rarer, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you shift the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set-grazing and film sensitive (ISO). activate the grains texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film-grazing and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels are shuffled to the reproduce of infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to use the effect on black / white photos, since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filtration applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the originator is under (1) and the revised image was set under (2) and the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grazing on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase sensitivity of movies, the manufacturers of large silver grains of photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filming effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street pictures, especially in your monochrome photos so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity of intensity and granularity. the default value is, although often higher values need to be set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film effects on a black / white image. the original picture is the (1) and this used (2). the used cinema sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious filter; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious filter; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural images and breastfeeding are good for that effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large images. smooth or, from the other side, look at the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting-effect. the original design is marked with the (1) and the adaptor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug has been used; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to create a sprout. the pictures whose gradients are slowly changing, therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you could choose to sketch. this would be good pictures to start using.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knob with a range of 1 to 100, to control this effect. the upper knob puts the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast (smoother).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon plate filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity of the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug, filter engraving its picture in 3-D, as if it was emptied in wax. it uses a protected by copyright algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug has a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly good in pictures with a simple structure where color does not work the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, montory landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the finished picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of art using distortion effects. it is used by copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the image in the cells and look like it will look at glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">The picture blocks 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo to a work of artwork using the visual effects. it is used by copyright protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: the image along the globular lines get out from the centre. this simulates a zooming camera, creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unstrils: caught the image by turning the pixels around a core. this simulates the visual acuity of a turnaround camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance: the picture is caught around the effect of a non-focused camera production. the object seems to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion-sharpness: caught the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the visual acuity of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softly intra: caught the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this produces photos with a dreaming and glossy focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle light bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shocker-sharpness: impregnated the image by random shift of the pixels and simulates the visual acuity of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent nonsense: the color of the colour can be found in the picture and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to create regiments on your image. this gives it a natural look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows to change the size of the drops. since the stalactness size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish augen changes the optical effect of the drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can start with the & digiplug. image processing is free of raindrops. use the tool to select the area, e.g. a face that must remain free to stay. if you start the filter drops, the range will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentrop filter. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools will be found in the menu of rotating and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to zoom out is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture bubbles and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, makes a good work here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Use a linear interpolation method to modify the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality, then try the tool for bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Splashine Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digiplug has been using a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio unchanged: if this setting is enabled, the new size determines the aspect ratio of the original visual image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes smoother, since it is difficult to create the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulenue effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons save as and loading will be used exactly. each photo can be stored as text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see one example of photo flaps, enlarged by a small colour of the size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard penis enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a frequently guided operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. the mouse is simply simply to cut the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse, the area of the photos can be cut out. therefore, you will receive a good overview of how your photo look like. you can change the size of the right to cutting edge. create a new rectangle by pushing it up with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the item, use the button The button button in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file to save or save the file to save the newly added picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the area of view, you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high format and landscape format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding aspect ratio is using a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same as you use cm, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons for selecting the selection, horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio button to assign the range to the widest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folding aspect ratio saves settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are displayed as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected in the specified picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of assembling aid allow help to blends, so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are a way to share a rectangle in harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden center is a division which is on different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pattern or the flowering leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the Irrationale number 1.618033988... and it was used already by the old Egyptians and Greeks. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you set up your pictures, buildings and even photos to make your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center makes fluid-free auxiliary lines available when you merge into a picture. these helpers are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Gold spiral is to achieve your destination good results for your photos. in comparison to the third party, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the spiral line and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles is used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line of its or different objects. this can be just as easy as being without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also drawn from the top-discussed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to place the diagonal to place an static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to interrupt your frame, you create an effect of professional photographers of dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is an attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button paint you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. you can adjust the color of the lines on your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture, where things are turned around a angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; editing and tool-free rotation. select the right rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are measured in degrees. with the button Preferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the free rotation is available a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse hand in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have fixed it on an important point of the picture, adjust the angle to the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is the function transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing is smoothed the image a bit of rotation. but notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perchial transformations are carried out around a fixpoint to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be calculated automatically. on the right side of the slide you will find some information which you can help to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by transformation.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that are created by transformation.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at: shows the current angle in degrees of the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees of the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">According to the perspective of the perspective, the image will be slightly dirty. for a single adaptation, this effect is small but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you adjust the perspective, you get unhappy three-square holes on the corners. a way to bersome it is the image with transformating cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The attachment tool is used to postpone part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no turning, the picture will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Check your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press on preferences, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the face area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you will find a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the picture, the image will be gotten a bit negligible. for a single transaction, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots are generated twice as much polish and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the expansion, the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the image with transformating cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packets to read and write. the available formats are therefore supported by your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries compiles were computed. in most distributions you can edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization are available to localise images from the spherical coordinate system that is used by GPS and Galileo. height, Länge- and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track than XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and psclone allows you to download and convert the data from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location Korrelator. this interface allows you to bring a number of selected images chosen by a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate to the main window and then call the menu. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file contains of course data recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is downloaded a automatic Correlation which shows the coordinates in red. GPS gauge data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera distance must be converted at GMT time. this can be done with the time zone. click here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time variance gives a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera output. the deviation ranged from below are collected in 2000 seconds. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have any trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the difference in 2000 seconds will correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a locating in a big time difference between camera and GPS is, you can set this limit here and then keep the button correlated to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue. this is useful if you have a number of photos on the same place. since the dialogue is to use the coordinates of a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed card and enlarge. choose the specific region and enlarge it sie.Add this always again until you reach a far-reaching accuracy. the card can always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are options to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module allows you to export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages. you can select the albums created as HTML pages, and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set is encoded as UTF-8 to enable a possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders who can be adapted to the settings. the rider selection allows you to select all albums. you'll need to select these albums. you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the range including the text box and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each side. this tab creates a gallery inside each image. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed in the picture. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard portrait, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder that contains write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, the file size is also influenced by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="828">The riders are allowed to give you some of the settings from the Album tab for the images, which are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user to how far the action is. press off to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to show whether error occurred during production. the web browser will automatically be at the end to show the preview of the gallery. press and close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture funnel is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture funnel allows you to view a selection of images and perform on them basis operations such as rotations, zooming or slide. the viewer can be used with short commands and machined. it was developed for a fast image display and fast access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed into a window screen.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG loss-free module is a tool to alter images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows for the actions listed below to store pictures in JPEG format, without any loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the color information takes place. this is also found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module's digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under kde-Imaging @ kde.orgram Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module is currently available via no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list of kde-Imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI teams.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata modulus, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target file, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after clicking on button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy anywhere from anywhere, but not to write to any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please refer to Exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG-dierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video, using a defined length. this module uses the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. this module allows you to create a background colour for the slide. with this module, it is possible to create the format DVD / 16th CD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the pictures that are packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can start using the MPEG Diaschau module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD file. if you're planning to select the file on a TV standard, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds which is displayed in seconds. the speed of the image process is defined below. a lower value produces very sudden, a high contrast a smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set up next. in doubt you should set them black. the name and the path of the generated file can be set under name of the MPEG-output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you need to specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start the production of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the divination when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that codiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing assistant is allowed to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together into standard images. these combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. you do not expect the best results of Him. do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results!</seg>
<seg id="855">First choose the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw picture Converter window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings onto the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimise the converting process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white. however, the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats. the filame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file size.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, reserves all information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you are going to edit your pictures frequently or you should not use the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before reading the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, metadata the metadata in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file into the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the button. if you want to break this process again, you can break it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode therefore, for example, if you are sure, for example through testing on a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the existing file automatically. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. a preview can be viewed as far as the progress is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module may also rename all images of a album. you can put the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the image.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to alter the size of several images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image to be smaller or enlarge. to this end, four types of the image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on the orientation orientation, i.e. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 wires): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: a proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can set the printing resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, with background size, boundary size and background colour is accordingly adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="872">This KIPI module allows you to send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. there is also possible to change the size of the pictures before. you can pull out more images on the list of the subject images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you have started the module, the pictures -window with the images you select is displayed. you can add more pictures on the button. for the last chosen image you will see a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also pull pictures on the picture list and add there to add the list of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images you will remove the selected pictures from the list of the pictures to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can OK with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail clients. you need to add only the addresses and the subject. the images you selected are already attached as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Please do not hesitate to send many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations to the size of the given e-mails. it might be possible to send a good idea to send a number of emails if you want to send multiple images.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and stored again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you need to install the Gmail agent on your computer before you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the election of comments on an attached file, the comments on the images will be added to a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the file format file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best suited to use with lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore have PNG, if you have a fast internet connection, and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in JPEG format are added, then the original exifdata will be added to sentimental pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically, so you can watch the status messages, in search of errors. you can automatically start your e-mail program at the end. with the knob, you can switch to this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After the launch of the Advanced Diaschau module, a window with questions such as you want to show your Diashau. you can choose here between the selected and all the images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option is using OpenGL, using very elegant images of OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, since otherwise the diacock will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file names indicate that the filename of the images will be displayed in the left lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop makes it possible to display the presentation in a final loop. you can then break manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option you select randomly to select that the pictures are displayed in random order. so it is not used to order the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the frames can be set between individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should be able to show it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly chosen one another effect between pictures and pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diashau, you can access to a tool bar at the upper left edge of the screen. move the mouse in this corner to switch to you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not have any documentation. if you are interested, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under kde-Imaging @ kde.orgram Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module's background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the current image, depending on the selected option of the underline, as the background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see & kphotoalbum; by these browses, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, therefore in each group, i.e. in individuals, places and in the group words are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can view the categories, for which you have entered and provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course viewing the current watch images. in the following, each image is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press with the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select a more person, only the images are displayed on which both people are visible. through this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the places, places and other settings, you can view images to view images of your application.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can store with & kphotoalbum; however, for every person a private preface, this also applies to places, tags and other categories that you have defined themselves. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button, which you need to adjust to the right outside on the tool bar. in this case please note that you can view the view for each category separately. please note that you can view symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of key words (if you have no appropriate images for your keyword).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must choose to define the image for each individual person. to do this, you need to select the picture page editor, as shown in the picture. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the cautit window you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and thus choose which part of the picture will be shown or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call the entry in the main window, you will show a dialogue that is very similar to the dialog for the determination of the image properties very similar. this dialog can still be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the labelling and descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, so for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures as defined in the picture, as you can see in the picture, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read books, but rather prefer to test functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage from & kphotovia; and look at the quick access, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog box, if you start & kick album; for the first time, or choose menu using the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. subsequently, some examples are uploaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotovia; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this lath can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this lath shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can display several different time units. each lath shows a different unit. you can change between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the lapping only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be used on the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first image will be displayed in the preview mode) and the current date shows the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button, meaning the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, meaning the time values. if you select a range, you will find only images of this period. you can break the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two options to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as a module available (see). in the following part of the user's book, the integrated version can be created via the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you will need to make some settings. these are grouped into the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following, each area is described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overlook and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created on the reviews page. nutrient information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last of all, you can choose which information is displayed on the HTML pages. so you can avoid that all pictures of a party are obvious. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all pictures are exported. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures before certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define as the HTML pages are supposed to look like. most setup options are clear, which is why it is not specially received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the images. therefore, you will need to contemplate your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. it can also browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, browse. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the various folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, choose a base folder for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent proposition a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you must select the folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location. so, you can select either a folder or select from KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check that this is really all visible for viewing. if you select a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL, which you set here, should be this folder. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy it. in order to specify importing the import function, see how properly, you have to specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described configuration options are related to all three based position or URLs. in these cases, a subfolder is created, whose name you define it in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking for a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you can naturally create an HTML page for viewing the images. if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images, recording place, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not even do once.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import another into your database. image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file, or if there is only a link to pictures in the file, that you can have all pictures together into the file, but the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can choose a .kim file directly from the menu File Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is searching for the images that are found in the folder of .kim file. if the appropriate images are not found, the images of the URL you are searched for creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is described in the dialog for Export of images, which you can call on the File menu exporting....</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act internal or external .kim files. there are three selection options available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the option manually copy the .kim file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the vicinity of the .kim file, copy & kphotovia; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file is very small, it usually doesn't want to compress the files. if you want this, you simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximal image size limit. if you would like to send your friends images, you would like to limit the images in full size because the .kim file is otherwise very large. here, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Import... select & kphotoalbum; export the exported database such as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Wizard to impose is made up of four steps. first you must select which pictures you want to import, then in which folders will import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you can find the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called out of your database. therefore, in the third dialogue window, you will be asked to imported categories from the imported file and which categories meet them in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can use the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. for example, you can see on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and watch: if you see pictures, you often want to watch images from different picture groups & mdash; if you're looking for example images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you may want to see all the pictures appearing on which this Friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information on your images, above (2) the search and look, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoader has been started as a program for managing your pictures. but it was extended and today also your videos. at many places in this manual it is spoken about images, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its information stored in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. it is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup power, to secure a diskette or revisions in CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and used this in future starts. if you want to read another folder in & kphotoalbum; if you like another folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings can be created; set up in a window, with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user you will be explained to you the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you see six different symbols, with which you can call the preview options and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call through a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In this case, as you can define for any image, different properties, e.g., places, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialogue that is used to process existing groups. you can select a labeling and a symbol for each existing group.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete memberships, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a Mediafeds as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup options available to you to the members of the member list. you can select the category that you wish to configure. in the left window you will find a list with the current category and in the right one list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; divides its modular system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plug-in interface. nutritional information is found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called upon the menu modules. the modules can be described and are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have an help page you can call on the memory.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with one another, it may be that the modules are tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always check out new modules with the Demo database before using the command line &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say I would not have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that are using the modules through KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is an album simply a folder. also if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This is simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, thus all pictures that shows you the picture exhibition at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum has to hand over a list of albums. here you can see & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums, so for example, if you're using the category people, so if you would like to select individuals and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the modules which modules should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photo album; with your own pictures start.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the windows of the menu that you can browse your image database. at the moment we will not find any information about your pictures. in the section we will show you on this window, now click on the entry pictures which shows you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any image with notes, where the image has been added individually or for a larger number of images, click here. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browses as you can read in the section, if you want to see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can choose three lists with a text box by adding people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the images within the list: if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can find that the names are moved up to the above, to find people faster and classify.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to show an alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting under the list below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen notes for each image separately, you might be able to edit all the selected pictures and have these pictures with notes. just click on the images and back buttons, which are located right below the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and select the menu item added to one's note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles lies in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that shows the US as a group of overboard. to indicate that there is a group of overtaking, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Find dialog it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new sub-category. in addition, you can also take an entry into a category and place there to do this entry to an subcategory of this entry. please note that you are doing your categories alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the dialog by clicking the bottom edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a window of your own window by drag it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">When you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which allows you to save the current construction and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also select a frame entirely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and then click on the window. this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will receive an overview with layout images of the currently selected pictures, or all pictures if you don't have a filter. for example, you can see the size of the watch images by simply clicking the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you place an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the picture packages. if you don't have a window to be opened with a picture display, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture. simply select the respective images you want to delete and select either the delete button or select the Edit menu. now, you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use with & kphotoalbum; however, pictures may also be saved without you on the hard disk. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all needed pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right-right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9, however, the pictures are available, so & kphotoalbum; you can view this pictures as well as pictures.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this function you will find out that you would like to copy files from the folders, and then copy them back. if you would like to avoid doing so, please do not wish to avoid the installation of the relevant CD. if you like to avoid doing so, please buy a larger hard disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu Pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you may lock the images so you want to lock up for other unaccessible menu. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures that can see your little sister, control and menu entry everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This means you have set which images will be hidden in the fall of the case. if you want to lock the laptop now on your little sister, select the pictures that you have locked, hidden. if you want to display the pictures once more, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to define a password which must be entered for unlock the images. in order to establish this password, select password change in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please do not think that this picture protection is not very safe. for one you can access or delete all images on the file index.xml. this type of password protection is only used to conceal those with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to conceal the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you're all your pictures using & kphotoalbum; manage and run hours over hours, of course you want to look at it sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum also features a picture _ and video editing. this can be viewed from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have on the picture, like e.g. who is made on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily draw it with the mouse, and you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is indicated above. all of these options are available following a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on this browser, see, appropriate entries to this view. if you click on the Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you were interested persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the keys image high and the end. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as slide. & kphotoalbum; then a new picture is loaded after a few seconds. how often a new picture can be checked by pressing the Strtrl button and Plus respectively Minus. stopped and stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful capability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it in full screen to change. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire place on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer you can easily draw a rectangle into the picture. with the mouse button you can easily draw a rectangle. with the minus key you can draw out the Plus key into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomed. with the principle of the zooms, the zooms puts on the screen to a pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Notice that the only zoomoperations work with videos that they're in and zooming with the Plus- and minus.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make remarks on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures, you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can check the image and configuration dialog of the picture to enter this name. but you may consider only to mark the picture and look further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with pictures and mark it as good or bad, while you watch one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to set images with features while you watch them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can press the corresponding letter. see a picture where the A, B and C features are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can see them in your browser. so, if you have all images you have chosen, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can simply use any module to copy the selected pictures on a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view categories in Dre Preview view, then you can add characteristics to the pictures, simply press the letters for the feature after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. this case allows you to paint & kphotoalbum; click on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted picture is not stored with the picture, but in the database. on the way you can reverse your brick later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see an image on the painted picture. to activate the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to end the painting you simply press the cross in the toolbar above the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must work the application of the program & Povray; not completely to rule, but the documentation on & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then, their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire module.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object as all the accommodation is already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following can be displayed, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed settings, click on user to take these changes. if you have invalid values, you will report a message with an error message. then you can correct the input command or disrupt the changes with the error messages.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setting dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 also contains the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you process a texture or a part of a texture, you can view a preview of the site view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered by the chosen texture, even if you want to select a part of texture renders (for example a texture in a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Screen photo shows the control points of the camera. you can pull these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is selected, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross is marked the center for scaling and turning as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a wire model element. you can specify this value relative to Visibility level of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are only then displayed if they are selected or their visible stage is smaller or equal to the chosen field of view of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovel; has a window arrangement than default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window layout or if you need any type of order, you can set them anywhere. you can also store several window arrangements and change between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To get a window over or under any view, drag the mountable to the upper or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the mountable to the right or left side of a view. the new view is based on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you would like to arrange several views over one another, go to the summary in the middle of a different view. you can then change between views through clicking on the cartel box on the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The final possible window arrangement are readed views: views which are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchoring, draw the mountable on the desktop or click on the small to the left shown in the summary bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To complete a view, click on the small cross in the summary bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can get them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can store you with view window order... save. it will display a dialog in which you can store the window mapping under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g to rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, it was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovel; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry to the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many routing modes, from a quick preview to top quality images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the tool bar or in the menu view Render modes... choose, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination-quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflective lighting. an exhaustive description of the Render properties can be found in the User's User & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is recated with only one ray per pixel, different errors can be created. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stud effects in curves, lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch Anti-aliasing, calculates and connect & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as a standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is adapted again and adaptive, because each pixel will always be divided and adapted to the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray mats a ray of pixels. if you adjust the difference between color values of pixels using super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated using a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference is passed between the color values, the pixels will be divided into 4 subways, which can be followed individually and are on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch to jittering, change & Povray; the rays is a tiny sum, to avoid regular samples.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; that calculates the diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to charge a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card you can adjust if the alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams do not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of & Povray; -console output. if & Povray, unexpected, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the menu entry file impute... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovel; not even the full set-catch of & Povray; if in case of implict error messages or warnings, a dialog box will show a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't support source code in & kpover; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovel; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the economic view, click & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. specify the path to your document and version. supported, versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (such as high field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you get files that are not in the folder of the scene you must also use the path to these files. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for control points. the second color is used for the display of the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the right cheques for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more precise wire model and thus require a better view for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as bullet, you can set the detailed stage for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross High detailed analysis for advanced projections, all wire model views are further subdivided, if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall is placed behind the objects. the wall is depicted in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor is stretched below the objects. the floor is depicted in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you are able to activate platens, the non-recursive antialiasing method for the rendering of the scenes is used. the values for the depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precise information on the parameters will be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window-orders. in the window of shutters, you can create and store windows arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window classification: displays all existing window-orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when you start the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The window pagendas list shows all existing window-orders. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a button with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views of the chosen window arrangement. new views can create and delete views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with a new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with the card you get a cartel view together with the previous view and floating on the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow any more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should make the ultimate yet easy scene, but you would like to make a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully read the following warnings before you complain that you can only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene will be in the dark and you only receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have done everything faultless, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window mapping:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to meet the menus and existing symbols of the tool bar. please read the documentation so you can get an appropriate performance of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, therefore, you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu input. therefore, you have a scene without any objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you generate. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right below), this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation of & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing of the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved, but notice that the camera can change in view points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button user or input, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene, for example, you could insert a quotas (insert osheaders) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method for solution of this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides an easier possibility. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and then press the button user or input. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view shows also the level even if at the moment only as a limited state. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you're interested in the object tree, you will find that you can see the entry for the floor. in this case, you'll find the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the standard options for each new object: scalability, turning and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move to the bottom to the exercise a unit under the horizon line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose translation and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just select the ground to adjust its material characteristics. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with one click on the button preview how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments only contains a matte black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color in the preview and scoop, then click on the button application and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you render your image now with one click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not the colour which you have expected. here are further settings needed. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree to be colored and change the colours in the object of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you just be able to perform this step because you should have the basic workings of & kpovmodeler; they should have already understood. the ball can be just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the opinion of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: 1 (don't forget to press the input or the button application), so the ball would be in contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would be floating over the ground, as you have moved the ground down to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the Renders now makes a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already in the ground, enter the sphere a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the object of the item and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the pigment, then select insert and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or press the input terminal.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness of our glamour and reflection results in some very good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learned how much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you ravel a scene from the perspective of the viewer from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera to render the scenes) through each pixel by the objects and broken, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects act like an example fog. thus, the scene will be machined by pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you'll see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you look at the scene. without a light source you can also see anything, the picture is simple black. obviously, each scene needs to be saved, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovel; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you have to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Represents the scene recovered in the last stored version. all changes have been rejected since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to only select if you do not have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last revocal command. this menu entry allows you only then select if you are used externally.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog, in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for the setting of & kpov., here you can change the look, the keyring and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for the change of the keyboard code. you can change or add new commands for & kpover using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialogue to set up the tool bar. you can add and remove the tool symbols for & kpov. commands to add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">One bump map is a way to fit rough surfaces, without changing any hives on the surface individually and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is usual to use the same file both for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic structures are simple geometric forms that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to a pixel basis using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a more comfortable image and browser browser. the application has a file browser, where you can select images on display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the & LMBn; or key Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image will be displayed in a window, or if all pictures are to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field is found in the right-bottom corner. if a matching filame is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog box & kuickshow; there are five postcards. in three of them, genera and machining and slide show, you can adjust the working methods of & kuickshow; set in the two others, short commands for the display windows and short commands for the browser, you can set the button cuts for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display surface is filled with the background colour which can be set down below. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, invites & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still see the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">This option saves & kuickshow; at the end of the last set of opener folder. at the next start & kuickshow will open this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the coloured bar to select a background colour. this is used in order to fill out the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture, the background is also filled with the selected paint.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can select & kuickshow; thus, only some of the file types are displayed, which may display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option is given for large images the display window increases to the full screen. this option is switched on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-interface of Amarok has many general functions that are often found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP-functions of collection, context-browser, playlist, playlist, playlist and scripts. an example call for the DCOP-function should be & zb; look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarok has some of its own command lines options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use the dialog, so the user can't run why a script does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the script scripts / Templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as basis for your own scripts or simply extend the needed functions. you will quickly realize that the writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange your scripts using Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is the use of the command dcop; that each KDE installation should be enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts make it possible to execute external programs and commands. usually the exec function exec () is usually used. this way, dcop &gt; is relatively easy to be called. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; send notifications to all current scripts. for this reason, scripts will continuously monitor their standard entry and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and store the setup data each script needs to take care of each script. when a script is launched, Amarok sets the workfolder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is used. the script can now query & b; with DCOP-functions further information about the new piece ask (for example the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals an amendment to the volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customised Menuclicked: submenitemTitle covers the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu entry can be used. in order to remove your own entry, you can use dcop amarok Script to the menu MenuItem (submenitemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminated, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM sends to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for instance, for example storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarite script management can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server. such packages are basically compressed with bzip2 (.tar), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be detected with bzip2 (.bz2), so the user can recognize the archive clearly as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extended amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining to ladle modules should not be executable. use the Tsar parameter to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1467">This allows you to create a CD-copy dialog, which allows you to create a CD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a CD, which you can then burn sometime later. you should also wish to copy them if you wish to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows the DVD copy dialog. this allows you to create a DVD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also use only a copy of a DVD which you can then burn after. also, there is also the possibility of changing a DVD with the help of copying files, so the target media must be big enough to get the whole (video) data of the source mediums in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW disc.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for shaping a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W) which gives the content completely deleted. & k3b; allows you to choose between writing modes and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">It burns a previously created CD image. the dialog asks for an * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a source of data which then can immediately be burned by pressing the burning touch. (Neros * .nrg files are not currently supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">A previously created DVD image. the dialog asks for an * .iso file as a source of data which can then be burned by pressing the burning touch of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted. this dialogue window is usually used after reading a DVD in the table, but can also be used individually. it contains information about the discharge video, coding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Shows information about the specified medium. this information is displayed in the table view and include properties of the medium, such as size and title length of CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is checked, the tool bar is presently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small lath at the bottom of the window is displayed. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switches the folder view or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is activated, their content will also be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, lock and unlock of the drive or throw out of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table view switches off or out. the table view allows editing and pulling files into the projection table. the table view is also selected to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view has been selected.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline switches in the projection view or off. the headline is a narrower area that contains only visible projects if the projection table has no real function, it looks pretty nicely and separates the project vision clearly from the other views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the keys for & k3b. after you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup assistance systems. thus, system administrator privileges are required, therefore, system administrator privileges are required, therefore you must enter the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b;. here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work correctly. this dialog is intended to Personalize and intended for finishing the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is as many other & kde; applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shellscript.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functional scope therefore, so is your taste and the way of your assignment is crucial, which the biting programs provide you.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the dcop command line. to make use of & DCOP; functions, you have to make sure that & k3b; started before. then enter something like the following console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde; -program common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can get a DCOP-reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via # dcop k3b K3binterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface that can only apply to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (Qstring name) The createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring shield) is addresl (URL:: List URLs, Qstring shield), peril Item (Qstring path, Qstring newname) and offset VoluneID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash Project = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $Project createFolder cash / foo dcop $Project createFolder / foo dcop $Project createFolder / go file.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; outputs for & kde;. with him can be saved easily audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data files in WAV files on the hard drive) and from many codiers that are encoded using this WAV files (these codiers needs to be installed from the Linux distribution). additional codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the Title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the machine (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav-files are compressed using the MP3 or OGG format, or in other formats such as the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia uses; cdparanoia uses. almost every distribution has a pre-compiled package, if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codiers have already exist. however, all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributor, but it's not necessary to compile anything about yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which codierers / file format should be used? chapter What is a small introduction of codiers, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & audioeciator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to detect any copy protection. if not the mechanisms of copying is not possible. do not avoid the mechanisms of copying attachments. just avoid purchasing copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be found so often up to a suitable configuration), the daily handling of a & CD will be explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim structure of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which codiers are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from the freeDB to get from the Internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is measured manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of commands from the main window. on the side step for example, you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab maps for the program configuration.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available Encoder, so the selection can be read with any other encoder as the standard. it is to note that previously the encoder has been configured in the tab card settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so the file will be selected to code a full & CD instead of adding a full & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the number of alerts (such as protocols, piepas) for program events (such as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog from & kaudiocreator; with various postcards (such as encoder, for setting up the Encoders). get here before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, codiers, compression rates, and helps you to choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC it is also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, which lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above these bitrate the differences are less important because both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'No so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from one machine or a computer-based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG-game devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-audio installations. today - early 2009 - these devices are usually only supported by MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters to audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame' help 'for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--Preset media '= This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--Preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi installations with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--Preset extreme' = 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for fi stereo installations with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--Preset extreme -B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of one piece. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi installations with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of one Title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better hi-fi installations.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--Preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolute highest quality without review to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD, information, typed manually or by the program automatically out of the freeDB via the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / used / used to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codibility programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the codiers and these parameters here. the manual or help to the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD, add to the key words (English: day) if MP3s with lame are encoded, the switch -tt is to be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which the audio CDs can read / enter the information up yourself, so that all the other information can be downloaded to the calculator. it is said to be observed only by text: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the Pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberlain) is not a lawyer. however, there is no information that you will be added on the & CD; more or less worthless, so can neither the artist nor the music enterprise be added. all information can be obtained from a byped by a & CD; business, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address when used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when accessing the server (This may only know the programmer that has verified the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator is used, the geographically is needed to use the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth within the network and resembles the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information on reading a & CD;. alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my machine?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that you want to know cdparanoia; who wants to be more precise, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see. note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed first if this is not yet to happen.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the deleted WAV files, the coefficient may be selected and therefore select the desired file format. during the first opening, there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab map. other codiers can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codierer package has to be installed by the Linux distribution before the codiers can be used. this is also required for pre-defined coding. additional information about codiers are in chapter 1 Welter Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, further information about his switch can be obtained through the input of an command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many reasons. check the device the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and readers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to put both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could be a hint of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD. this will not be successful!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is an chapter with a step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips as you have to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to establish those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine because it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have screaming on it (eg; by trying to copy anything in with the Conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & audiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the precursor of a & CD, which has to be repeated for each end-up & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the parameters for compression of the music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we divide the program using the freeDB to use the & CD; data can be downloaded from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to edit a & CD at any time, if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is given to the reader program that it can read the & CD-data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive. if this is not available or if more than one & CD is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device records for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The lock map general settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example it will be displayed as input as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, select that you will be informed when information is missing for the dispensing of key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The Map CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we're comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically downloading the Internet of a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the reading of the & CD; connected to the internet so it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD entry is found immediately, if you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filenames or tag file, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Conquad - &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde;</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to enter everything manually, select the selection fields and freeDB is not used. however, this is more than 620 MB big, if you're worth reading this. however, the two selection fields have to be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server on the internet. how do the system, which data will be saved? read the section over freeDB. do everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have to download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look into a mirror server within your closeness. on this way, the load will be distributed between the host. however, this setting is used as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both will work as equivalent to the server, as many Fireworks have moderately booting the protocol 8880 standard, there may be more happiness with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocols is usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit the data on the freeDB server. the first check box should deactivate.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp does not exist on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of intermittent pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time comes with just one existing drive? try reading and code? the author doesn't know, hence try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the final note: cross this to the & CD; take a look at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must be specified by the files / folder where the WAV files is ready. if the box is not checked, the files are not checked in the private folder. don't forget to do this folder if you want to do something with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All as input as it is on screen photograph. the command is a bit long, under circumstances, something must be smoother to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--Preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, it is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression rate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later amendment of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: using dual-core or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is because we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading of the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the type of music is organized on the hard drive, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will pick up. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we are using a & CD which is not yet available in freeDB, screen photos are a bit different from the data available for a & CD; with successfully supported by freeDB. therefore, you will learn to manually delete the & CD, instead of using them from the Internet. comments are indicative.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this sample is a 'special' Edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, then the & CD has to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as shown in screen photo. this is only when the & CD should be identified as audio CD; could be identified and found by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, you are looking for questions and answers after the help or proceed back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Please note: if the & CD has been successfully taken up by the freeDB, all titles of the pieces have already been completed, and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case that there is more than one entry in the database with the unique '& CD; key for your & CD; available, you will select a window, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best on your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you are not selected the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the Settings), you can also manually redeem it by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, but you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the design shown on the next screen photo. the title of the tune in the first line of the input field ', the rest of the data in the input field' Album '.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered any more in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments of inidially each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful sampling the data from the freeDB is not empty, but it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor, so you can not only start with the artist and album names (for example whether all the words with letters of letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags; this option is set up on the tab card code; take a look at the tab 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. take a look at the help of the codiers to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry, obviously with the style of the open-ending CD; in this example it is not important because we do not transmit the & CD. for more information go to the website of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to find under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current one. the title of the piece is definitely the case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process you to the same way until you have entered all titles of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Please note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. you have already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. just the titles are selected so selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or select the button will select all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection, read the reading process, this window appears to confirm the confirmation. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is to be read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the bug has occurred directly after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 into the format MP3. so you can read and code in parallel. note the status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behaviour. the only thing which seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and encode. with powerful machines the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 does not seem to be able to read and code (from however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the code. after the last piece is coded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and caravan player from & kde; in addition to other things, he has some features with real-time graphic and karaoke-line links of texts, some other features; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound projectors, which is required for GUS Cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics text on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (grazing events or textures). KMid automatically determines the procedure in each case.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Support support. if you end & kde; during the playing of a song, KMid starts again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI-synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS maps (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select from the menu File. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also make a file from a & Konqueror; -window in the & kmid; -window will drop. this works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and feel the button you play in the toolbar, select the record player from the menu piece or fill the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts when you pull it onto the & kmid, -window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece is playing, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song becomes too fast or slowly played, you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the tempo. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">Space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar or the select of the menu plugging in the menu piece, interrupts the playback. bed the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use textures, others use lyrics and another. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is used automatically, which you have to adjust nothing manually. if you select the record auto selection menu, the karaoke text will automatically be selected, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries in the event or of the events. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you are able to summarize. these are played by the number. in this section you can use the collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the item... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copying and then add the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the swoe in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button. there is again the file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the adjustment of automatic transfer to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic transfer to the collection is activated, a piece for opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will automatically be added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If it is not enabled for the collection, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied in the opening of a piece. then this collection will continue to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played. if you select the sequence of the menu selection sequence of the menus, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or edit random order in the menu, the order will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">In order to play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selective list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump one song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to skip a song back, select the button ahead, the entry predicted pieces of the menu piece or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, choose the collection of the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter, since they are not being saved during leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI viable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events in events, which understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create an MIDI map which converts all events of the Changing patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore will always be used to sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all soundcards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS Cards, FM-devices, and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. thus, you have to edit the appropriate file of your hand (with your favorite dog monitor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">An MIDI map is a text file that stores all the needed conditions for the play of one piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. but for this, however, every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A more keymap... END define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that dedolphins is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can help in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is specified as the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and don't leave the line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that do this instrument onto the tone with the number M. if your keyboard supports no riflashing (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun powder. to do this, take the following in the PATCHMAP-section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (rifle), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the concept of drum-patch of patch it is meant with which every sound represents another percussioning instrument (drum, tank, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as many keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how tones are depicted on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as the presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and any instrument each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used mainly to form sounds at the percussions channel. check out as an example the supplied keychains.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on any other way. if you want to change the first and second channel, you can easily make it easily in CHANNELMAP-section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards on a specific channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, built after the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on Channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will also be using the name Name for this channel. if you are going to use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this canal. in this case, patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio gives, in which ratio of pitch-Bender events will be multiplied by the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected only. the value 4096 is used so that the map file is not decimal (decimal).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM gives a keyboard to play a Pitch-Bender Event with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, several keyboards may be higher up to one octave up to one octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use an MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu under Settings, item MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, you see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument at a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a tool, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to indicate the played sounds. view the settings in the menu-side view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD shows the speed where one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the speed of a song. so if you find, a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows at the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a piece of music it has to be played. it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can not force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you compiled a binder (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid - without AWE support. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before, you should absolutely be able to add automatic adjustment to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow key to the left from the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the standard pace you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kiss; desktop window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or detoxify (if I want to play an MIDI file) or play a file, merely go to the & Konqueror; - window switch and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without add them to a collection, turn the setting automatic to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.E. only do you want to play the first file only once. so you put the adjustment Automatically adding to the collection and open A.C. Your temporary collection contains then an MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then connect, also B.mid and C.mid to create and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or watch the postcard, this will animate me to program & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maidan; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maon; Laga. at the moment I am unable to take a lot of time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I try to program MIDI files, making music, and phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files if you want a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you simply want to make me happy, write an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antarr @ arracus.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your residence or MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all that send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I'll be able to contact me by using a MIDI file, but should get in contact with me as I already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my free time and has no emancipation of money. I would like to emphasize that I am only able to write my messages from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - Keep the bug that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks is also Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter Grass, the Thorsten Wesleden, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, fault compensation, or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also applies to all of these excellent musicians in the network that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is formed from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. in addition, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window, which is only then displayed if information is to be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to locate the preferred connections under the menu. if you want to create a list of entries, which are played after each other, you should use the Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to receive an additional level of view. if you ancer an entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and start playing with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and continuous playlist can be changed. of course, you can only do if & kmPlayer. you can also choose from the menu click here, but also through application. for this purpose, click on a name of a category clists that will be viewed from the menu. by clicking a subgroup only the XML contents of this section is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing the XML files, you must select from the menu that can be chosen with playlist, and select either the modified mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the examination mode should leave or select another group without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during the start and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obtains option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmPlayer; files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / signal .xml and ~ / .kde / share / video player / exit.xml must be observed. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during the start doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would be annoying with the end animation, but the user can therefore terminate the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a Start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; elilgt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / dev; / lt; / dev; / lt; / dev; / lt; / lt; / dev; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / mixed;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmPlayer. here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider to this playback dialog for & kmPlayer. everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc, such as the backend of the backend by mimetype. here's an example of a 'flash' with the Schrodec-Mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmPlayer; you can even add the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order to play the & kmPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & kmplayer module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave flash in the application dialog of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmPlayer; is available in one consoles or search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. the designed process is called crackplayer. if there is no mistakes, the baking output is within & kmPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always a given backend for a particular Mime type (of course only if this was determined also), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon shall play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmPlayer; can be used by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvPlayer). before TV can be viewed, the scanner device and the TV channels must be used manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the box is to use the dialog under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should ports be detected, of which one is selected. the correct name must be found (eg is PAL for West Europe), the correct name is probably a DVB t.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmPlayer can only use Xvideo, it should also work on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux extension for the X server should also be functional. for the XFree86 server, it has to be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally they are used by KMPlayer for the sources of different names. at the time of the origin of this documentary these are dvdnavs, dvdsource, tvdsource, tvdsource and vexsource. if they are activated, they start with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints as I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I don't play by him (not from any of the vcd: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -e 8 / dev / cdrom is considered to be root root according to the device. it is definitely sure that / dev / cdrom will be shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts to start slowly, why does my CPU need to be checked up to performance?</seg>

<seg id="1751">Just a good reason to & latex works here, it is not the ultimate book for it. to rule & latex; right, for example, H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dained.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just as other landmark languages include & latex; an introduction to which the generalization features such as paper format, side effects and text area can be specified as well as a kitchen with the command\\ Begin {Review} and must be closed with the\\\ 'command}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The fast-entry assistant of & kile; is a well-efficient function for the rapid creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the assistant (MenÃ ¼) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document. you can also create some related settings on the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: hereby, the type of the document must be seen: article (Articles), Book [Letter], Articles [Letter], Articles (DIN) [scrutcl], Report (DIN) [scrutcl], projector [beamer], foils [prosper] or user-defined document.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: this is what the character encoding is set. modern systems are going to use UTF-8 encoding as standard. if necessary, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list includes the usually used packages for ex & latex; for the integration, they can only be balanced at the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Report (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes by Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN EN). they should always be used in preparation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users can therefore not worry about. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Toile; offers - as well as other source textbooks - the emphasis on the used commands, attitudes and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile, you should not have noticed any mathematical search function. however, you should have noticed in a modest appearance of output file. however, you will save you through the rapid appearance of output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environments, in case of inserting a new command (e.g.\\ Begin {command}) by & kile; automatically generates an empty line (for the input of the text) and the associated line to the check box. this function can be reproduced in the menu item... LaTeX commands can be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into several elements. & latex; refinement of the document in the following elements (part is the most attractive and subdivided the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the single elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; -files can be very helpful always. once a DVI; file [germ] absolute file (English. D e V ice I nylon File)] has been created, jumps & cile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file includes a description of the format document and other information such as font art and is also available in addition to PDF the commercial output art of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools available to view, conversion and print output of DVI; -files for various systems and tann.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the backlog-search are the elements of DVI; -file was clicked on to an element in DVI; -file was clicked on, is the exact opposite of it. as soon as you have clicked on a section in & latex; -source text is clicked on, becomes the corresponding passage in DVI; -viewer relayed.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for working with several files. using a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .tex files. during the use of a project a project wide master document can be set up for project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quickening: the & latex; -source text is compiled and the result automatically displayed (if no error in the source code are available).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File services: in this mode, the DVI / file is brought into DVI; -File on the back-to-stream, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quickset.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Considering the editing tool bar the three great selection fields should be displayed. the first selection box is designed for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The versible and latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for other information is available for occasional articles such as keywords, fuelled notes, and references. the veritable gays are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command is called for a section, a picture or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed designation (selection above a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">Using quotation from quotation, a select list with literary entries are displayed. on & bibtex; files are appropriate for editing & bibtex; files are corresponding editors. the author has good experiences with & bibtex; and & kbib; files are made in & cile; files are written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for determining the font. it can be specified for the main text, the legs, etc., etc., the following text includes:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & cile; two selections are available for the preparation: 1. the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document art and festival legend of the settings. 2. the document may be written by hand on the basis of this document.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The clamps after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the instruction. the adjustment [12pt] sets out the fonts. if the font is specified, the font is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex have to be compiled; the simplest way is to use the menu (s) or the button fast.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & ile; for storing the storage needs automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compile of the document fails, it should be sought after the errors in the protocol. when using quickset & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, it should also be considered the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A surroundings (English.) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. if, for example, a report with the fonts body will have created a different font. the order\\ Begin {Environment},\\ To and\\\ To {environment} are to be shattered by the issue in the environment. it is covered in the environment (English).</seg>
<seg id="1781">All changes will be obtained only within the surrounding area (from\\ Begin {environment} to\\}. there is no restriction (number) for the first changes in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many features available to the alert of the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain types of fonts, livepressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. are added. these commands may end either with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Begin {feeling}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is open as long as it is closed with a\\ '} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\' h {word} Cursively.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: created a quotation in the document. the quote begins with\\ Begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is given to writing the source file with the & latex; draw lessons are now follows a step-for-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant a little text was entered, a few adjustments should be accomplished for the better readability of the document. in this case, mind. a quote from a few spots in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to application should be seen in order to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be turned back to the editor by means of editor or Ctrl (in the internal viewer). an external viewer needs to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">As soon as DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a non-independent file format (English. D e V ice I nable). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers on the computer. there are many different types of .dvi issue such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF, transformers or computer monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed out (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar is the transformation of DVI; file into other formats. as soon as DVI; file from the & latex; -source code was created, the conversion can start in different formats using the buttons on the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-search encourages the direct go from the editor to the matching position within DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. for this purpose, only Modern under Settings Kile has to set up a choice of tools.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to seek out the previous search, the mouse pointer must be clicked on one line of the source file and close to pre-search results. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; comes with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; document of & cile; added and to the corresponding line. for this purpose, & ile; be specified in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece. (settings the eyepiece set up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quicking of & DVI, it should not be possible, an error can be submitted. if a mistake should be submitted, it will be displayed in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocol file uses the error source in the source code. in the editor you can always check the button in LaTeX error and NÃ ¼ chised LaTeX error. in order to consider the faulty line, the error needs to be clicked on the error in the log file and switch it up to the correct row.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button is clicked on the toolbar button, a window appears to select the selection of the available template for the document. the voids are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">As a selection of empty document, a document may be written either by reason to re-written or to the assistant to the fast preparation of a new document. more information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Real users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates are created in & cile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file has to be created or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template using existing document and selection of file presentation...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, some strings may be replaced with different data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables may set up in settings in the customile settings...</seg>
<seg id="1803">Therefore, when creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which are variable:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $: this string will be replaced by entering the document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {Note}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry to the commands in editor. as soon as the document has been completed in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">With the creation of a new document, its own template can be fully balanced instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; -files created. will be used to create an easy way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and which are described under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; used as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be carried out in the menu tools directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">In order to learn more about & Kate; and his collection should be experienced the manual of Kate. users of & kile; you can start working directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & Kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be called for the volume of LaTeX reference. it includes an exclusive description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with button Ctrl key to select the & tex; -word that means that in this way, click\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par with this way.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a squeezed mouse button, the selected text will be copied automatically into the cache.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, you can touch parts of the source file in the Editorial Window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Harile; has the possibility to browse the most diverse types of source codes and emphasize this. for example, the & latex differs from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another colour.</seg>
<seg id="1815">A lot of assistance must come up. this is a unique type of bookmark within the text. it is also highlighted by a single type of edit within the text. this springing stamp allows you to highlight this jump, so that they automatically refuses to mark the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the main aspect effects on using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; important functions for the writing of a & latex; provide important functions for the writing of a & latex; provide special commands for their selection. under editing, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Lt a complete section of (group of lines that signifies on both sides a blank line). this enhanced meaning has not been added to tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source file. this is the only noticeable thing in & kile; is therefore that the transfer is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Watch the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command is also called & latex; -commands with a distance (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To be part of a part of the document, it can be easily removed and removed by pressing the button. & Kate; offers the keyword of Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kile; offers with own commands for a faster result. under edit, the following commands are included for the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete section. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description on editing section.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already clear that environments are a central role in & latex; to play. therefore, & cile; for further commands under editing surroundings for a mful work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command will be sprayed at the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the order to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command will be bound to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to check out the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is located before or within the command\\ Begin {environment}, turns to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">During the input of many earnecked environment commands, quickly the open environment can be lost quickly. this command will close the most beautiful surroundings, so that the watered environmental structure will not crushes.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by staples {...}. under Edit TeX Group are a few important commands that correspond to the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command will be speckled at the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the inserted clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command will be sprayed at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the feeding clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor is placed before or behind the clamp of a & tex; -group # is, will be speckled at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">During the input of many veiled groups-brackets, the last group can be lost quickly. this command will close the most recently ended group, so that the closed structure of the & tex; group is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions for implementation is used. for the purpose of implementation it is used in & cile; the character is used for two simple instructions for the sign. & kile; knows this case and for two shut-in charge signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic closing of the double-charge indicator can be set up under the cile settings... LaTeX enter and can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. nish or French), as well as German or frantic seizing signs. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">At the setting of Shift; entrances for an intelligent line breaks. in case the current position within a lists -environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize) is located, add & kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close to a washer-environment close to & kile; the current line with\\\\ with a tightening cliffy break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to underline preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. this can be found among the settings... LaTeX will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users can arrange the columns in tables and thereby apply all Et-characters (amp;) to each other. if this tabulator is, it is impossible to inert. if this tabulator does not allow it to be added, add & cile; some intermediate space for the columns are added to the current Tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Even though & Kate; already a good source file containment has been added, this in & cile; for special commands (usually for ex & latex;) it is still available for different modes. all of these modes can be set up for different ways below settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment, with the command\\ Begin {environment}, & cile; automatically added the\\\ 'Command:\\\' s command} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the pitch is the last character of the input, the last character of the input will be removed, and this makes the reference list. on the other hand, the list may also be resized by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are made of a short description of the command. alternatively, the descriptions are made available, such that a simple jump to these positions can be open to these positions using Edit Sprinkles, and the newly designated parameters will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings File; set up... colile; abandonful settings of these lists can be made. there are several different lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands, as well as a place of general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not possible for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ Begin and the call of the fulfilment mode will be a large list of environmental requirements. on the other hand, the environments are used as often that & colile; a special mode for contamination of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling of the editing mode about the menu-editing environment or the key space bar, the order is automatically frozen, and it appears\\ Begin. after that, the ambient temperature can be continued on the simplest way and can be completed by setting the input.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is completed, the environment will be automatically closed again. once & kile; recognizes that it is a list of files, even a first\\ item command will be laid out.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings File; set up... colile; disposable settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of editing mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-in, which & quantum threatened, have to do with & quantum. thereby, the plug-in system is very powerful. you can't wait until someone can't wait until someone can be used in & quantum. plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements. more information can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start-in with the Edit menu. this allows the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows all plugins to manage and add new add. we describe every & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location, it is quantitative; this path to search of the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project several people work in a type of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantitative information; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties - dialog configured.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the top name of the user and serves for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as Team Leader and Subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of Team Members who he is. this is done by looking for the team member from the list and pressing the Setze + button. the currently selected member (their identification) appears to be fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Top names and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage of the members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders if something is done. see in for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed if something particular is happening in the project. one example would be the drawing of the opening and closing of the project, so that a file would be backed up, or a script that plays a file in CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog can create events, processed and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An e-mail is sent to the address chosen in the receiver list. the addressee may be a team or sub-project leader. see in, wei such as a ladder.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments on documents. they differ from normal comments through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note: it can be chosen either the note -entry from the Editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary range, followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Remarks can be sent to a determining member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), the team leader of the project manager Subproject leader After the enriching and subproject managers should be given the corresponding range or subproject names, as in the examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nickname and roles names are independent of large or small-notes, but spaces around the clamps and the clamps are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantitative. is a development environment for script and formattening languages, the DTD-agnostic is supported and webbased formatting and script languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible through the Settings menu. here only about & quantitative information; -specific settings are covered, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta... to be called. this dialog extends over several pages that will be treated in succession.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantitative information; regarding tags, including car, can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / miniatures of tags: large / small friction of tags: large / miniatures signifies, the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / small friction of attributes: large / small friction of automatic attributes. normal large / small friction means that the attributes will be added as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically exclude: if appropriate, it is optional for tags for which the exclusive day is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not optional tags: as above for all other tags, except for easy tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and closing day automatically update: if switched on, the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent signs: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the appropriate coding during the entry.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: mimetypes for detecting different types of files. by means of the standard, the default option can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard drawing code: the coding of newly created or in other way as with file opening open files (where the coding of the file can be surpassed). however, this setting is extracted from the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is extracted from the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantitative information; created regularly backup copies, so with a blackout or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as the saving file. also for even stored documents, a backup is taken regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editorial area or your own view (or the documentation in a carton), which makes it possible to watch the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface through changing the MDI modes and andocks / depend on views are drawn into each other. it is the --resetlayout command parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning bar -section serves the control of the possibility of shifting the view of warnings by atting from non-questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; it can also change the symbols of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source code view in split mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here, the parser and the structural tree, which represents the figure of the Parents nodes in the document, can be hired in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the range of mouse click on the structural tree, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structural adjustment, the visibility of node in the tree, the actualization of the tree in editing and how deep during a change of the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty blocks are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are found where no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area to the volume of abbreviations (a kind of templates) that can be unfolded in the editing on a large text. discounts are valid for several & DTEP; s can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid, there is a valid group for PHP, in which the ifl abbreviation something different means in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed here. plugins are members of the third side, which can be re-used by any KPart application application, the most famous & conqueror;. when plugins of a plug-ins must be given the following:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to Plugin, if it is not at a stand there like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is transferred to the plug-in at the start, so it can open the current file, the associated file (path of the current file) or the folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Only mode" mode: check if the plug-in is refusing to load. only-Lese-products refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: this is enabled, then testing & quantitative information; if the default information is correct, then the plugin will not be available if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. Diedebugger was shut down, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which enables various implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plug-in is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantum Saul.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project begins with the selection of suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. using the options next to the debugger plug-in selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a project is activated for a debugger, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the content of overwatched variables. usually appears in the left-hand dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all hold points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this promotion, the connection to debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plug-in with, on debit demands. this action is used by default if a project is opened, which must not be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen sitting the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the lute to the requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP request to the server to create a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the edition of this requirement is displayed in the debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Points to debugger, to start with the execution of the script and to send information on the revised variables as well as the currently run on line. if this is done, the version is done. if this is done, the script will start with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Points to the debugger, with the execution of the script, without information to overwatch variables and the current line number. if this is done, the execution goes on. if this is given, the execution begins as soon as a requirement is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will lead the next script in the script, without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will lead the next script in the script, whereby if possible in functions and include, it is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points to the debugger, the instruction to go over and to the next so, as if the current is not.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog box where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the overawoke value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable may be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt & quantitative information; you can adapt to your needs and how to help & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Eedit packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantum. they enable & quantitative information; abilities to provide support for markup- and scripts; abilities such as car completion and calendars. their simplicity and flexibility is made of & quantitative; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and the toolbar. day folder contain two file types, the descriptionrc; and tagXML files containing two parts, the text and instructions faster into a document as a user could ever add.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created earlier (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see details about converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc, and also tool bar. short, one & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the Featuresdialog, the & quantitative information; for the day shows the rules and information of the & DTEP; even tool bar allow quick insert of tags in a document without risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag file are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc, and the tagXML files. day folder bear the name of the descriptive language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the day XML and declare if they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an tagXML document. it can contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but does not contain anything about yourself otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tags type is a script function. when using it & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type Method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element describes a attribute of a tags. this element can only be used for any attribute. it sets the name and the type of attribute. in addition, there are more tags that will be shown how this attribute will be shown & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Is available to fill the source codes for the attributes listed in the tag editors, and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantitative information is used for reaching the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of a interface. the dcop methodology within & quantitative information is used to achieve the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and methods. the arguments put to the method. may be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day grouped out the elements of a list together. it can only occur for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Determines the position of the attribute box of a tags within a dialogue. this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and size of a field on the dialog. this day should be present for every box in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">There is a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All day XML files must start with an & XML; declaration begins: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and need to be neat and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the day XML files, the tools dialog is to start in & quantitative; window to start and check TagXMLA. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, check the check of the day XML files in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -schema. the filename for this day XML file should be schematic day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a functioning family 2 day XML file. in this file it is described a & PHP; transfer function. the filame of this tagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc file; file is also quite simple and there is a editor that can be processed via DTD Bearing DTD; for a modified & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; it should be created with a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries be created:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = use 1 for & quantitative information; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD: / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified Name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can restrict action to set-up actions... click on New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is assigned to the button. clicking the button user can be assigned a button closure; with Kone the current keyboard cuts can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest promotions. it can be entered in detail in the detailed settings and inserted by the action, this text is inserted in the document on the current Cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that may change the document or modify (or parts of the document). examples from & quantitative information; even the quick release dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be the name of the script and the interpreter. for example: SH / home / myhome / myscript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptaris variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable, which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document file, file name: / from the documentation name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; process will be replaced by & quantum. only one instance is running, the text can be used to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used for controlling & quantitative; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the listed methods, a script can be obtained from & quantitative information; on the default input can be determined, which is to be sent to the standard application. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input can also be redirected the output of the specified application. there are two kinds of issue: normal edition, written on the standard issue; error messages must be done on the standard output written, which is set to the default configuration written by the value that the select output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool bar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. press the new Action button at the bottom of the window starts the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the day's attributes and you are planning to activate the action, activate the "Day process," if available, so that a input is possible on the use of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igoun! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented we will use & kiconedit; use. choose from the menu menu; select other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the promotion does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">In mind that the day is startup, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. through the use of green (green will usually be interpreted as los, rigid, further interprets), or should at least, a message to the user indicates that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, there must be still associated with the action. this happens to set the menu with settings actions... (in & quantitative information;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field you find a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and place it with other tags, so it's still there, or confirm it with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantitative information; functions for tool bar supplement or it should be shared these for better overview by a few separators in several groups. open the tool bar setting up dialog over settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after the selection of the element, which is to be added to the tool bar, press the button bar to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator does not support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & Konqueror; button on the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by try all symbols in order to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the proper folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct file, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust so that their toolbar (s) should be downloaded (s) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantitative information; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formulas language you like. therefore, this chapter, as I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantitative; -Repository whether someone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existential documentation for the formatting / script / etc;. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part we leave you to the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = pfad, relative to this file, for example, version 1 = extract 1.html Section 2 = -1.html Section 2 = fc.html-1 = tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag3 = tag.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defined the visible part of the documentation in the Documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc thee = php42 / # top level element = index.html Getting Start = Introduction,... Introduction = Shtion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax, basic syntax = long-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Block and Language Reference. it shows that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the box-depth (except the reason) mdash; but try it even out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents are referenced to one file (and consequently, at the upper end of the building table and mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative; Resources.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is to be shown for the operation of the context-sensitive help. by selecting the functional name and pressures of Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the Context list (Contacts List) and the file lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate Context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc just as well as $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps for local and global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worthy to be shared, submit your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used on the & quantitative information; -Repository for the use by the & quantitative information; -Repository for the use by & quantum. -Society. you will not be rich, but to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitative information; you are not alone. it is possible to share the resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an email to send menu input, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, toolbar menu of files and folders in templates and scripts in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantitative information; -users can download and only available if our team needs them as correct and usefull for the publication, for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can choose a look. in the dialog New Resource, you need to fill out the input fields (URL preview can be empty) and clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD (DTEP), tool bar bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before the installation, investigated & quantitative; the integrity of the resource by examination of integrity and signatures. in case of problems you can carefully see. if the integrity given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML-languages which is currently not supported by & quantum. it can be time-consuming, because hundreds of day files will be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and Converting to a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Targets name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quantitative / dresp folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Defining: the string that is in! doctype day, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / or e.dtd should be released</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after the conversion: when activated, brings & quantitative information; according to the conversion and descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; to be adapted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantum of Saul, there are some key concepts. to understand and to understand this fundamental concepts of & quantum. this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts, without understanding & quantitative; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitative information, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone who is widely selected & quantum. by tool bar over actions, everything is being marked in the common folder structure of & quantitative information; this allows the group of administrators different tool bar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to each in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are user-specific samples and tool bars. local elements are stored in user directory so that they can use only this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to business segments with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted sizes. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which collects the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">Quantum Committee; -MDI; consists of a few main areas: the Editorial Window, the Baumanors, the Kartonites with information and the tool bar. please beat in and for more detailed information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to obtain a contextual menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all diets, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right commands in the Editorial section lead to another context menu relating to the machined documentation (cut / copy / insertion), editing the file under the mouse pointer or open the file if the string is described under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorial Unit, the toolbar of the editor will be present. presently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitative information; the tool bar will be adapted to new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if they want to paste in their document, then click on the symbol that the day represents. if you want to insert the data for this just one day. if you want to add multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill up different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanners (QIT;) allow it to open and navigate within the information and quantitative information. in the presentation of Kartonites are available to files, project, pattern templates, documentation structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative information; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by means of correct mouse click. promotions such as add, removing, high load or delete the files from storage medium can be performed using the shown context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantitative information; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is open to you all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context it is used. the category depends on & quantitative information. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are used only in the project. more about templates can be found in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available script languages. clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document is displayed. by the right click of an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the Elementum. by right click of an element, a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree will appear among other building concepts. it can change various attributes and name areas. it enables you to change the contents of all the available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the Web-technique for your development. it can be downloaded from quantum documentation for & quantum. it can be downloaded to your documentation, and by adding a folder doc or a project you can edit and viewed by adding a folder.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitative information; two antitators at the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the usable information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This antitator shows information on each in quanta running script. thus, for example, the DTD uses the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This antitator shows all the errors in the market up of the current document. & quantum Saul; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantitative information; business segments are extensive expanded and easy to understand. show it on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate bar on the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantitative.</seg>
<seg id="2103">A further function of & quantitative information; is the ability to send a tool bar with e-mail. & quantum. send the tool bar as a compressed file over & kmail; if they receive a tool bar in an e-mail, they can secure it in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt to the location of & quantitative; -files on your system. for this purpose, autoconf may get a number of options to be delivered to the configure script. / configure --help you. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantitative information; you should verify that your path contains the & kde; 3 I folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their I folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative information; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitative information; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During effort to create the best & HTML; the developers started to deal with a close idea: what would be when & quantitative; a unique, extendable brand-up editor would be? well, this would make him the absolute most amazing web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Not longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. combined: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be generated & quantum; therefore, suitable & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantitative; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kiss; developed in good use of free software, the idea of why developed it? thanks to & kiss; -rumor is not only this possible, but allows users to developers, & quantitative; so to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitative information; allows web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this enables automation to increase productivity with almost every task. by dealing with the program compiling, they can read & quantum. (more about it can be found in any).</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantitative; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a speedy web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantitative; Plus is not connected in any way with commercial versions of & quantitative a; the original developers left the GPL license version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in details about the details of this document is written: / quantitative a (either this URL in & Konqueror; input, or helpcenter help: / quantitative a).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quantitative and is currently developed and cared for by Eric Laffoon sequel @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A high-speed list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not located on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as template for the later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to insertion from the clipboard, included special characters for & HTML; -friction that they are displayed correctly and cannot be understood by the browser as formattening assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -lock, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used for insertion of & URL; s are used in the Anker-Tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch the log selection on or out. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; to select.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or SED with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the screen window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Evaluation and startup of the problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantitative; principal owner. the problem reporter will be activated once you change to the structure.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the toolbar left from the main window. this column allows you to bookmark a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there is bookmarks in the current file, you will appear in the menu together with entries previous or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmark the other hand-opened documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quantitative information; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Present a dialogue to add files to the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the folder directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or a folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">How & quantitative information; the project is administrated. in chapter & quantum Saul; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads the tool bar. these will be kept in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new tool bar. actions only need to define the name. actions need to be added by means of tool-toolbars. tool bar will be stored on toolbar bars or you will be asked if you want to store the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of sight. it does not extinguish them from the hard disk. if you have not saved the tool bar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Therefore, you can send your own tool bar to someone (perhaps to that & quantitative; -Team so that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu option opens up a new eme message with the tool bar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of tool bar to the main server, where each other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load one & DTD; you have made or anyone else made and convert into the & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh captions from the & DTD; it makes sense if the Entities from the & DTEP should be used to renew without the whole & DTEP; if this globally is and a write permission in the global KDE folder fails to fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific underpin.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or disabled the intelligent entry of tags. at present this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion signifies that & quantum corrects by means of toolbars if this day does not contradict the rules in this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the above menu points. click here. click on the activated plug-in disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax statement for the current file. the list of available herding schematics depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms to create the developers. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Review the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected & DTD; using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the various types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch mode can cause time or unbeautiful graphics. it is recommended by default mode, which is also the default mode, or the sub-window mode that is equivalent to & quantum mode; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">Additionally, this menu contains an entry for each open window. with selecting a paper, the corresponding sub-window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantitative information; the main window was switched on or out.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog uses any application that use the HTML part, including the & Konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">The behaviour of the Editorial Unit deals. in the documentation of & Kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete records from the toolbar, or modify them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create an aid correspondingly to the environment of the mouse, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative information; is a qualitatively high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but like with every open source project developers can always use your help. if they want to support & quantum. if they want to support & quantitative form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project, for example, after filling out the project, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will automatically be completed. all these paths and author information panels can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project characteristics are set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name of the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative information; -Project file. by default, it has stored the name of the project in small letters and without spaces (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine to which you want to access, except one worked local data. either a name (hostname.examples .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you can use this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol may be used. depending on the remote computer, it might be necessary to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and standard templates. if a joint collection of files are used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a joint collection of files are used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. several files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webination you want to download and change. with serverpage scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check if files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be embedded in. if a project is started anew, not anhaze.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the folder and you can make a precise selection of good cores.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by anhaks or, by removing the checkbox, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can upload in the menu with project project characteristics in the menu area profiles, or with the keyring Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder), which are to be ignored for project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to up, even files listed in .cvindicated are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The projection of the project is being loaded by opening the project. in addition, more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This enables the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is found in. the debugger plug-in can be set with the button options. in this case, the error search is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be set up, as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile, by drawing a very own construction site for every profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow of event configuration, one can add event actions to change or delete these actions, change or delete events. event actions are executed if a particular event happens, such as the Ships of a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantitative information is provided by default. the last project that was opened. this behaviour is currently not possible to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog project will open and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantum argument; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantitative; changed files. the same happens if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project developers are free access to the files in the project. you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behavior as well, however, the entries are opened and opening with... in with the right mouse button-on-call menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be searched for. the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only a profile is available, the button is canceled to remove the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forget to make programming. this possibility is useful if frequency load is needed and the rather unsafe password will be saved on the record - option does not come in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion prior to the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative information; many high-loading profiles are created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. on the editing or creating a profile, this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the Name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use them to be stored on the plate, so that it can't be read on the plate, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A projection view is only a set of files and tool bar. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simply plugging in the view, various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the newly opened files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted at the toolbar project or the tool-tool bar within the toolbar project tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative information; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of & quantitative information.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantum rose; best on the toolbar toolbar. use and tool distinguish. adding tool bar is covered in the section adding tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be adjusted either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), the toolbar can be set up, toolbar codes or tool bar can be carried out, which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be seen on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a tool bar, the entries can be removed and action displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Tool bar and the actions on them can set up the toolbar in the menu with settings... and set settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in key document bet, code cutlets and files for linking. & quantitative data. you can copy, postpone or each connected directory with extended organisation and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the system available in the storage room. templates have set in & quantitative information; in about the restrictions you need for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitative information; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions required at the start of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that is not pure text. there can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc; binary. binary files are usually found in documents by means of global templates (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / URL). some examples are found in the storage room below global templates. more information on the template is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text documentation. based on these templates, new documents can be created in corresponding subfolders. one makes a simple report for the purpose and organizes the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the storage room below global templates. see in more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into documents based on a template, but the same text area can always be inserted into documents by a comment via a final menu system to be found on Javascript or Perl. some examples are in the storage room below global templates. see in more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for all Web sites as template. they are a collection of different documents organised in a folder structure. currently there are no examples in & quantum.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure based on exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As a referral template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this has happened, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the front room under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document, and then click on the file as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with pulling and put on the site template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file only needs to copy to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and pick or add over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the Project Files to a folder on the right and secure site template, secure a name for the template and secure. by default, it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project template enable a very well-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and headlines, or dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or link with them. in addition, one can keep some things on using templates in projects very deep in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files used in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / Apps / quantitative / apps / quantitative / Apps / quantitative / Templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To establish the behavior of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button to select the folder and select the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A select box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection has been canceled as soon as the attributes of their own Attributes are inherent.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the genealogger in the previous edition. if a regular folder was so adjusted, there would be templates in this path, except it would be explicitly activated. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed leading or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a file with special headlines / foot lines a whole presentation already with the matching headlines / foot lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (which show the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders, or copy and insert of templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitative; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source editor that can be reached via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; Editor and the second divides the editors in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: he invites you to document a document like a normal & HTML; - page and a cursor. then you can edit and activate the source code editor, in which the necessary modifications are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor in one document, the & PHP; contains, shows a small green symbol the Vohandora of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; page editor. it is not necessary to edit this code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is exactly like the first one, except that at the same time running the modifications in the source code editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, this mode is already active, the keystrocker switching the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... following the option of VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is to be set. in principle, the recommendation is: a little Spanish for fast calculator and a large range for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of website, so it is possible to select the documentation of the visible tags in the work with the VPL; -editor possible. the document Properties -dialog is also called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created, which is to change the reduction of the suspension body.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document even e.g. tags for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows editing the inhalted, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword keyword key.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the view of pages in the browser. one can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as with the Meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-styling template by pressing the button-opening button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is as in a text processing, possible thanks to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted via one type, and can be deleted by typing or remove removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insert of tags is made in the same way through the toolbars, such as the source code editor. it is said to be noted that the insertion of tags are not removed earlier than an anchor day, which is inserted by text, any other an anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some of the toolbars such as the tables assistant or the lists-assistant are disabled. they are later used in & VPL; work, in this release, the tables or lists of tool bar must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare it. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributions could be made, and at the same time corrected a lot of changes. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program that was used by me showed me only the altered lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the regression has changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So, this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in line and modifications to white signs. later, lots of other useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare this text to a fast text, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into an adequate file-browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of co-work and changes to changes. in this editor you can even edit the result of conflicts and shows the result of an expected result. in this editor you can even process the result into three Quell files at Merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also with the same and merge folder. this screen photograph shows & kdiff3; in conjunction with the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the accurate differences and betifies the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, you can see at a glance at the Summary in the column on the left-hand side. (no trouble longer, if Any one changes the returns.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the other distinguishes itself in one line, then the color indicates that file is different. the red color means that both of them differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can easily get the filenparwork by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder, folder 2 folder, folder 3 folder, folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual installation of filenames, select a selection of the file browser (file...) or the selection of the most open- opened file from the opening list. you don't have to specify a third file. if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or merge of folders will be initiated if you select a file, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If Merging is crossed, the input field is active for the purpose and can process itself. however, it is not necessarily necessary to determine immediately an output file. you can also get this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before you start playing with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would like to compare only a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the intermediate shelf into the active comparative window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening dialog you don't have to select the dialog with the breaking button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Zip and Abbot: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from a editor and let it fall via a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains more similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would only be able to create two corresponding files, and then compare it into & kdiff3; download and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can remove anything from & kdiff3; only the flashing of text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and laying of text in another program as cut and inserts (instead of copying and inserts). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info-line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a time to rest on line. then a small relief window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources of the spring are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a color blue, B color is green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees the color, which file differs. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is well shown in the next section (Merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left alongside the text is the combination column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (in C / C + + e.g., white signs are only relevant in strings and comments concerning the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the merge column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line will be pumped at broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below comparison list) has also a info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [hits] if you have processed the result. usually, it does not contain text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts disbanded, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons jumps to the next redeemed / Hungarian conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative levels are used, each difference must also be solved at the same time a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking one click with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is shown in all windows, and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also be a jump of the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group is not visible.) This group is highlighted with color background colour for current field and each on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge tool is left more in the group; then it is displayed in these lines of text & lt; no line in the boxes. this text is only a placeholder for the case that you will change your opinion, and perhaps a different source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a mark you might copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; collision configuration; however, if you copy this text from the outcome window, proceed carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if your sources select the options described above or IgnorkC / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or commentary are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mainly with image-running and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are used in one of the windows, you can use the arrow buttons on the left, right, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. click here to navigate to the navigation use.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augmented window you can also use the other buttons to do pane. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (default is the plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the cladding columns, synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already described in the section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Figure Forward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl picture downwards / Ctrl picture above) or to the next / previous conflict further than conflict. therefore, between soldered and unsettest conflicts has to be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the intermediate shelf, you will need to copy the button (Ctrl-C or Strg-Insert). if this is activated, what is always you to mark, automatically copied to the cache file and the manual copying. be careful because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the intermediate shelf.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenue are stored according to the basic operating system. UNIX variations are using a line-in deformation system\, and Win32-based systems use motor circuit\\ r\. KDiff3 reserves the line of the source file, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files will be stored automatically and will be restored to the next start. (menu Inside &gt; Cardiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog can also be programmed with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences will be displayed in descriptive writing. if the chosen scripture does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered gerastated. on these systems, the button presets automatically an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, then the Tab key is inserted the respective number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or press Return, the retrofit line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, any selection will be copied automatically into the intermediate rack. the manual will then copy into the intermediate rack.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which Zeiling type you prefer to store. the default value is the usual choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files tries to find & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines can be found in the source file. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step, white signs can't be ignored. similarly, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car backsign '\'. usually ignores & kdiff3; the car backstage, but then they could be displayed on different sizes in the side-to-side comparison, although this option is enabled, but when this option is enabled, this option has to be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.', '-'). in the result, the differences will still be displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated in default. changes in commentary are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Looking for smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-rejump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before going to the next untiled conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the functions of voters A / B / C for all unskilled white conflicts from the merging menu. note that the automatic selection also may include conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore or IgnorkC / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are described in the chapter on scanning of folders and passing a merge operation. look for details in documentation to the directory comparison and merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is the Suffix .original file. if already such a backpack file with the Suffix .original exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not concern the current program. you need to finish and restart the change. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is stopped globally through the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, all entries will be used for the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for the coding appears a short notice, what the local code is. (this can't be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this is influenced how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file can be selected individually, even files can be compared with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file processed, you can define what coding is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define supply commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this down to suppress Herafations of changes in white signs in text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in figures or comments if the options ignore the numbers or modify IgnorkC / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you want to compare three files. in normal mode, all the differences in a color-coded transcode column will be shown. after selection of A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -C; C, A & B; -gt; C is indicated in addition to the normal still a second column column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just send the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">The comparison window lines next to each other or above. this can also be useful for ads of long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes, consider the differences and decide inabruptly the files combined. a simple click starts to merge the merge command and use the file name of the last source file as a preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge command, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">In reading a file it will first hand over this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which can precisely use your needs, or to correct the reverse.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Reading a file, it is given first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command was given (see above), then the output of the command is used solely when ordering. you can write your own preprocessor, which is exactly corresponding to your requirements. every input line must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to facilitate the user more flexibility when setting up the diff-results. however, an external program requires, and most users want to do it themselves. the good news is, however, that in most cases SED or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to include automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). all follow the same pattern $\\ _ BAR _ dator\\ _ BAR _ Files\\ _ BAR _ Files\\ _ BAR _ Files\\ _ BAR _ Files\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with SED, you might get to understand it and perhaps you may appreciate these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignore of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for Zeilenab. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character from' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hits is not replaced by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several objectives at one time. then you can use the Semikolon '; they are used to separate the objectives from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / switch 'allergy however there are some details different in perl. where SED\\ (and\\) requires, perl needs only (and) without the leading'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data based on the normal preprocessor will maintain for the ad and lead. further operations are only changing the data that the line-equalimus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the frequency processor uses the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or hidden, you can't notice certain differences in consideration, and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer must edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge the folder with & kdiff3; complete folder.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... make a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal prior to the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... supports selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merge of individual files. you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as a target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders does not start automatically, do not lead to the merge command, select the corresponding menu input or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you informs a small news window with the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is closed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that has been found during the scan, will be displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - or on the object, or by folding the arrow buttons for your left / right. the directory menu contains two functions of all signatories and fold all subfolders with which you can fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on one file, the file association is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other files, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object. in such a case, the collision action can't be selected automatically. if the Merging is launched, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder will be considered identical if your whole content is identical. then also folder made the same color. if folders is unsignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this colour scheme is based on dirdiff. colors reflect the colours of a sheet, which is only green, then yellow is and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if it does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C does not have the same datatype (e.g. if A a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such errors exist, the collision can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same datatype (e.g. if A a folder and B a file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such errors exist, the collision can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder, and when the option directories are synchronizing. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and save the result in both folder. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after bringing copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and the option reactivate new file instead of merge. if the files are different, but the same date will appear, but the date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Should such bugs be not removed, the collisions can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During Merging, a file is modified after the other. it will show the status column when the merger was successful, and according to other messages, if something unexpected is finished, you should make a final review and see whether the status is everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When set-in dialog the file comparative method is selected, the diffuser will display 3 other columns. these contain the number of unfold, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soldering conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the selected entry (file or ox), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merging promotions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then in the three folder mode C, the target is used as a target which is used as a target and used for synchronize A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder. there are some options to be skipped in the folder structure. check out these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring together all the entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the button closure) to bring together only the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">When contradictory data types exist, more invalid interaction exist, a message appears on the faults elements. you can select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog window appears with the options pass, simulate and break off.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes. you then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then take certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge into a single file), then opens a merge window (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select the kernel merge again or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then takes & kdiff3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a bug, a message and detailed status information is displayed. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that you can help you to try the cause of the problem. if you select the program again, or you have the chance to solve a different action for the entry, or to solve the problem in other ways before you continue with Merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were set individually, you can see & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and lead them together at the later time. even if the merge updates occurred or not saved. even if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu by & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; Cardiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory assistance with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are shown on the indicated model are displayed in the element tree. select the pattern with a Semikolon; select the pattern: '*' and '?'. (eg. * .cpp; * .h). the default value is *. folder must not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders equivalent to this pattern is not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as a divider character: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders equivalent to this pattern is not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as a divider character: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous produced files will be ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be specific with a .cvsignal file. (see below info: / cvs / cvindicated.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">Some file systems have an error attribute in some file systems. this option allows you to select a leading point. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to the links below. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is switched on, the links are covered as normal folder. if the option is switched on, a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a final loop and then crdiff3; freezes off.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistic curve. (the number of soluble, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (give an appropriate anti-sample).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it's possibly faster to compare the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use it with caution. this option is gging off.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change of change. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered as identical, if it can be equally big. this may be useful when copying the change of alteration. please use it with caution. this option is gging off.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Synchronizing mode mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was given. in this mode, the proposals for merging will be selected so that both folders are identical. this option is shut down in both folders. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of bringing the copy of the newer file as action. (this will be considered insecure, because the other file has not been modified.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted by another file, then the original version will be renamed and the extension .original If an old backup file will be deleted with the .original extension it will also be deleted without any further backup. this option is enabled on the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merging side remains visible to the merge of individual files; you can shift the divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn the window directory & text window to turn off the main window in the window box and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare one file via double click. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also use a single file directly from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be done automatically and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, however, if you want to read the directory: list -menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone. or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle language &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL is: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by using the protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change of change. hence, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note that this option is only possible with local files.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently available as a viewer viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop begins first always the built-in difference viewer. to launch KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then choose in KDiff3Part shown from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then it starts & kdiff3; the program patch will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part 1. please note that this does not work if no one of the original files exists. besides, it is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the combination or the comparisons of files is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is compile) there is already. furthermore, the name KDiff3 has already pointed out that it can lead to the program diff3 out of the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs very long and I have learned a lot since I looked into the springs of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go there.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You do not have the program compiled from the sources and configure the configure script not to the right PREFIX to KDE. in the default setting, configure / usr / local, but then KDE can't find resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are described first as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be treated as the same. if the Lines is the next to Each Other, this is is, but this is is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor you can see any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it's too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text, no src is left; no src has left; released and the text cannot erase. what does it mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors as highlighted by differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use a different editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and errors came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the log-log file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; compile and install, use the command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE gives you the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsafe, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automatic make use, you should not have any problems with compile. should however difficulties appear, please tell the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt) copies into the intermediate shelf and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Umschalt inserts) add the text from the intermediate position to the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to upgrade to these options to update the folder with the function updates.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to show the differences. this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder. if the target folder such files are not already included, they are missing after the merging. (the behaviour is probably modified in a later program version.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are attached to one of the selected buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group. if the lines are already available, they will be removed during clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a Minipreview of all virtual work areas. it is quite practical to change the running programs on the desktop, to change their size or move it. this works both inside a working area and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual work areas as well as the applications for ongoing applications. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; motion can be moved within operation as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on, where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & Kpager. however, if you clicked on an application within & Kpager; click here to minimize the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries to minimize, maximum working area and terminating.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop space. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the & Kpager is displayed; the names of the virtual work areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field leaves the & Kpager; the numbers of virtual work areas indicate. it is designated by name, names are provided with ordinalnumbers, & eg; 1st working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each working area will also be viewed as a backdrop in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty work areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple displays with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with its standard icon and pixel map shows a small view of the real program window. note: pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager can be used: classic leaves & kpager; used in a 2xn grid, like Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally shows all virtual work areas in a vertical array, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to view the window as symbols or with its content and move it outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and selecting the switch... allows the dialog box to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this can't be changed in dialog settings. but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have a write permission for the file, you need to login to your system administrator. in this file you need to assign the key windowTransparent mode and assign value to this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window, and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and postpone the contents of the magnifier structure. this goes also with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you add the & Shift; press or use the MMB; you can move the screen window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer takes a while on the same place. it is thought to help people who emulate the repetitive strain Inscriptions (RSI) Syndrome and which every mouse click pain. furthermore, it may emulate the drag with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain which is created when clicking the mouse and thus helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, suffer from pain which are connected to your computer by using your computer, if this is not yet to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clear: even if & kmousetool is helping to avoid the mouse when using the mouse, it is against pain caused by the control of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aid, the result can fall for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool is simple: & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movement and leads a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shifting-up, makes & kmousetool; a break when the mouse button is emulated. move the mouse, wait until the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can run the drag by pressing mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This limitation period must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelleakening is turned on, the shooting process is set off (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting for the mouse when the mouse button waits for the mouse when the mouse is converted back, if the mouse is converted due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; support now the click through mouse shift. is this function enabled, creates a slow motion to the left and back, followed by a break, one click with the right mouse button. this movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; to move the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcentre, go on sound & multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider. there is a sling sound buffer, which you adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please select the respective documentation to find out how you launch a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If you set all settings on the values, which were set up when opening the dialog. have already pressed the button application, the settings will be reset to the user's level when pressing the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first use the preferences. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be switched off. if you click then to the automatic mouse click, you can later use the intelligent shifting.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & kde; at sounds too decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Initially you should make aware of which places a mouse click without effect. clicking on the neutral components of windows or on a window in the browser window, which does not display a link, does not lead to unintentional reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckily, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse, but also the rolls that come in touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to remove the ball. as this happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear quickly if you watch the mouse at the bottom of your mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the Loches where the ball was inserted. it can easily scrape off with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if just a shooting was started. if in this case you can use the intelligent shifting system, this means that & kmousetool; the operation cannot end anymore due to the letting of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; you can use and move a window under another window manager.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is reset by the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and places the cursor into a different place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor place where you want to make it. but you can use the mouse on a neutral field of work if you want to make sure that the mouse is void of unintentional reactions. safe zones for mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces are the toolbar and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I am trying to work with the intelligent shifting, but I do not create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can avoid it. it is well possible to insert it into the clipboard, to move it into or add any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse button. but there will be some advice here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shifting if you just start using & kmousetool; to use. instead, click at an end of the text area and hold down the switch key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will result in every time when & kmousetool; the mouse is pressing a sound like a mouse click. then you can just use the intelligent shifting even without the audible mouse click. but then you can use it for some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use to be installed, the Xtest extension for & X Window; must be installed in most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse click is only available when the system features a sound card and speakers, and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; is the mouse button shortly confused. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and which the actualization of the puzzled pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be set up so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse is let off. in this way, also the pulling and lay with the mouse can also be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktops; they are not required for normal work with & kton; filter does not require.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited, before he will be sent to the mask dispatcher. they are useful to improve pronunciation or breviations to select a suitable language and speaker, or to avoid certain shortcomings of language synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "" "" dispatcher "" "" with a text works. & ktts; differs from four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen-Reaxes has the highest priority. it is set up on all other orders and holds these orders. if the edition of the screen Reader has been read, the previously held orders will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is going to be hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and plain text. these orders will continue after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application that uses messages. while you are looking for a long text on a web page, you can welcome to & kmouth; someone's looking at the room. & kde; -notifications are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order, which you can address orders placed by the ticket orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that uses text applications. text applications are intended for the issue of longer texts that have no particular drills.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader while & ktts; just a reading, this issue is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen-veins. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages, and text applications, as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are done as modules. in the future, there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Substitute parts replaced parts of a text by other text. ordering parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & kton; will be supplied with pre-defined character filters like: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to a different format. in delivery of & ktops; are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">You may send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text to & kton; sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice on the board ticket, you can read text by KDE messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters can be set-up rules after which it is applied to a language output. if the filter sets, its rules are not applicable, he continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or an & kde; -notification to & kton; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up in the list below. the editing is carried out in the order from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This is the list of the furnished normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be operated from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of the filter, and you will see the following setup programs below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting strings filters, you will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions. if these samples are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the respective replacement text. large and small friction will not be considered compared to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Specify a name for your filter. you can choose this name at any time, it's only necessary to distinguish themselves from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replace it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the shown order from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">Here is a value entered, the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can use multiple programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID run programs will be obtained with the qdbus program; the & DBus; numbers must be weaverted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 is displayed, you can only copy copete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The default filter filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Apply filter when all input fields are empty, the filter can be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. words must therefore be limited by dividers (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing off regular expressions. if you have installed the & box; editor & # 160; regular & # 160; regular expressions installed, you can add it to the dialogues or edit # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regulary & # 160; expressions found in ambiggen.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the ambient variable PATH, even xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker optional filter, you can send text to a certain speaker that is set up on the card ticket, or to a speaker with certain characteristics. you can define for example that texts by kmail should be read from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text comes to the filter, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker is provided by the speaker characteristics, which gives the text to & ktts; send, and the characteristics of the speaker, select the speaker, select the selected speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to illustrate the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Place the characteristics of the desired filter conditions here. if the text is fulfilled the above filter conditions, the user is selected, which corresponds to the desired requirements. click on the right to display the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your microphone settings or to delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker utter filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with one entry in the case of dict filters. you have to apply at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you see the SatzLimits filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set-of detection filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings, or add further satile Enlargement filters, but you will get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn language selection by try out. turn on the ticket selection menu, which speakers & ktts; choose, change some features and check how the speaker's selection has changed. to this end, you have to set up more than one user, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts, then can start with reading, since only the first set can be processed, and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop or cancel changes in the carton card, even if the language is not supported this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal satile detection filter is automatically set up when you start a tsgr. for the first time. it can't be disconnected, only be removed. do not change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satile limits filter compare the text with a regular expression of punctuation and include a table sign (decimal code 8) on the proposition limits are automatically removed from the text. note that the default value detection filter will retain the drafts.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied & kde; -News (cold), warnings, news, or the issue of Screen Readers.</seg>

<seg id="2740">Here, select the properties of the desired microphone. if this property does not play a role, do not give any role.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box, if the property is to have priority before other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">As the language is a critical factor in the issue of issue, it is always treated as a prime feature. you'll be able to specify this property. if you know, you may need to specify the attribute you might want to specify a specific application in another language when they are introduced in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the area of actors, which is to clear the following passage, click on the template button standard and then use speakers who is most likely to follow.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before you start & use; check first if your language works correctly works. follow the instructions that you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizer whose source code is obvious. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages. in many voices you can adjust volume, talk speed and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help you find in the instructions that are supplied with festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male UK) voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, therefore you need the source code of festival. the German voices are subject to limitations on passing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice uses the Festival 1.95 beta or new. the voice is still in an early developmental stage. if you set up the software in festival / lib / Voices / Russian /. if you want to set up the Russian vote, you need to use the _ ru _ ru _ nsh _ diphone. choose a kyrillic (8-bit) code like the KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions. search for the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the flag must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use Russian voice, option coding needs to be set to 8-bit Cyrillic as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & mbrola; -Synthesizer. then takes the lexicic analysis and & mbrola; generated from this the audio output. the & mbrola; -Program and the & mbrola; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & mbrola; no complete language training system is. & mbrola; generated language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create these diphone. at the festival this produced by & mbrola; needed diphone. txt2pho can also produce from German text Diphone. more information can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process, additional Wrapper code will be added to the festival to use & mbrola; -voices to language synthetics. be aware that the & mbrola; -voices are not installed in & mbrola; -folder installed, but in the folder festival / lib /. instructions can be found under</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German festival is a modified version of festival for German & mbrola; -voices. required for either festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install Festival and & mbrola; then download MS German Festival from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & cnetworkconf;, one module for the & kcontrolcentre, which enables the management of the network interfaces, the routine and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcentre, allows users to manage a series of system and desktop settings over a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcentre, can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcentre;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolconf; to make the user a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcentre; displayed. module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be accessed by selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet & network networking settings in & the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not installed. physical devices and their drivers have already been working-installed and configured, that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and setting up the network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases device drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing and set up. network devices will be added later, the drivers will need to be loaded by changing the following files, according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings will be charged, if the option is selected in & kcontrolcentre, index. when starting the module's network settings, this system is trying to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can't be recognized, the final selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and the release of it. by selecting the setting of non-again questions the setting can be taken permanently. in the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode. previously, all options are shown grey, which means the settings can be considered, the change is not possible. in the system management mode, you will proceed by clicking the button mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password mode.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. by the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button 1... in the dialog device must set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Settings shows the dialogue with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are made by a DHCP server or BOOTP Server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings will be used for the system at the same time. the DHCP- or BOOTP Server will be required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With selecting Manually, the TCP / IP address can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initialize the network interface at booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialogue are displayed as properties of the device in the box list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & contra, you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off after need. switching a switched off network tool by selecting from the list and click on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. turn off a activated network device by selecting from the list and click on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subways.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface to the network, where the gateway computer is located, must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces the appropriate IP address. it is necessary to understand because computer can only understand IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org is required, then it solves this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine for the name resolution part of the horseman name resolution enables simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS items may be placed through selection of a contract and running or down gradation in the list with the buttons on or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button adding... from the group machine to name resolution, a DNS server may be added. it will add the dialog New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and add the button adding the button. the entry is then added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to name resolution, select an entry and then click on the Edit menu.... It is displayed the Edit pane.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list is acknowledged by well-known calculator / IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting, if no DNS server is available. in small, completed networks, it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of a well-known calculator contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. these are still available in the Test version of IP, in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click on Add.... The dialog New Alias will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add. when the known computer has multiple Alias name, de button Add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog box is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings used in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source file.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough when & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply the rpm package to download and install in one & account; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with a graphical surface like kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages of libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only advised to compile users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf will be discussed; alterable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't replace more stringent knowledge about IP networks. in this Annex, only fundamental information about the integration of the PCs are mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). it has never found large spread. IPv6 is expected to pass through the near future. therefore, this description is focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge, which is IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the network administrator to be used or if available, DHCP can be used or if available, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When waging your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially designed area for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded during the internet, therefore your application is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up one Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the range of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are based on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local own machine. usually the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files containing from & knetworkconf may be affected, where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections another content is defined as specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by using the scripts in SuSEconfig. another state can occur as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first object was to store multiple files on a tape. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you are guaranteed?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be connected by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; set the tape back and reads the prestressing of the tape. recognizes & kdat; the tape on the tape is not, you'll be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the procedure, it is looking for the right index on your disk. can't be found, you'll be asked if the band index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive, to indicate that the band has been involved. in the status bar there will be a corresponding message. the content of the tape can now be searched for folding the entry into the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before discard the tape, first the integration of the band must first be solved. there are three methods to evaluate this.</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives an amendment to the tape for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a message in the status bar. the band can now be unmounted without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat; format.</seg>
<seg id="2901">One band cards must be formatted before you need to be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drives must be formatted before you are formatted from the tape of & kdat; it usually requires a formatting of the tape, DAT drives, however.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all the data on the tape are lost! after the end of the process, the band will automatically be involved and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. it will only ensure that file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a safety profile in the tree. only the files listed in the profile will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in local file-tree with a Häkchen. only the so selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click on the local file tree and choose the Zip Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">As soon as the backup was initiated, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box provides backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only be selected to select the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a Häkchen. only the selected files and / or subfolders are examined.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the check process has been launched, the dialog box for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the workload for verification.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can reproduce the playlist, the files that are to be recovered will be tagged. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or the subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a Häkchen. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and choose the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the rebuilding process has been started, the dialog box for restoration. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the workings for the restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears to restore. this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remainder of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to create the band indexfile from the bandwidth of the band content. this process will delete all existing index files for this band. you can regenerate the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">By this, a safety profile is created with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a safety profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, where the backup is to be done. the list of the secured files will be updated automatically according to the just selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders which are listed under the backup files, only the files found therein are on the same filesystem, such as the folder. folder that lie on other file systems can be deleted separately under backup files. each entry will be viewed from tar irrespective of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files secured themselves since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to establish changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this ensures that all files are backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">Settings can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-rev version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmit & kdat; before the tape is involved in loading the drive. for some drives, this is necessary, before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; it's possible to unlock the outlet for tape drives. possibly, this setting does not work for all band-drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the delete will automatically be selected at the delete of & kdat; you will automatically use this option for floppy streams.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; the hardwarter file size for the tape drive. not all drives support batch sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case the log-size for your band drive is required.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only prove a storage block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n bytes) The band ID. the format of this string is calculator: seconds, with the name of the complete name of the system it is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that has passed since the time in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are purely tar archives created directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incomplete backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a securing association. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystem log; is a & kde; viewer suitable for systems protocols. the program is for unexperienced users that can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system enables you to get information about your system or where the system enables quick access to information on issues that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystem log; helps users understand what your calculator is in the background. the task of & ksecosystems; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is deposited on the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksecosystems, experienced users access fast access to information on issues that occur on their server. & ksystem log; therefore tries to provide some extended functions which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files specific programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystem log; a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different kinds of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included in the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen picture, & ksystem log; functions are available, with the help of the single protocol-lines to be easily filtering and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystem log; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol is opened, and it opens up instead of its a small news window, so you will find & ksystem loglog. the protocol files can normally be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user normally no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected criterion or to fill in the filter bar. in the default settings, the select box will be displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line is only displayed if in any of the columns the string of the filter search engine is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this point. the string of the filter search engine will then be selected only with entries in the appropriate slot. therefore, for example, in the filter bar, select the name of one process, so show you & ksystem log; all protocol lines which were sent or created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default settings and helps you to detect the important protocol-lines. protocol-lines of level errors are displayed using a noticeable color as the protocol-lines of the level error. the colored display of protocol-lines can be shut down dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show certain process (for example in the System Protocols or in the cron protocol), so you can examine the process identification (PID) in the column process, for example, if you want to examine the output of a given command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can turn the option to the new lines in the context menu of the main window, to show all new to the upcoming protocol-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; allows you to use multiple protocol files into separate sub-bars. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows. once you select a window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystem log; has its own website on http: / / ks.log.forum-software e.g Dort you will find more information about the source sources of & ksystem log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; can also be found in the following folders of & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystem log; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section performs some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly developed to the standard for control of the programme starts at the start of the system in der & Linux; therefore, because it's easier to use, more powerful and even more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (other things because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binaries is below / sbin and not below / etc. it is therefore important because somebody could try to take a machine on system V Init without any reinstall and new format. therefore, you have to be sure that the old init was removed from there if there was a one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you would like to start the system or change to another lap level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things as setserial / etc. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use of it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit of doing something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking at different places after the program init and starts the first one finds it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the preset runlevel 3 is. if you're changing it, you can edit / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3. be careful if you have something through them, then get it manually by restart the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scripts? if you're going -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no correct files. instead, each entry is here a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written that there is an argument like startup and stop. you can actually start this scripts out by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it includes a K, the script will stop with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running running, the only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running. moreover, I also could have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; you should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index finger is simple to say that it is trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stopping).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between Runleveln or modify the position within a level by removing it elsewhere. thereby, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or his position), this happens if they pull out an entry from the area of availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you select them in a new section. to copy them to a new Runlevel, you need to select directly from the menu edit or from the context menu, and even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry cannot be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the resulting entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are no possibility to restore entries in the paper boxes. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the different workareas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below previous data.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone entry into another lap-level, move it into the intermediate position (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired race level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a single entry, press the input button to switch to the properties dialog. use the dialog button to accept the changes in order to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw out the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before being executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv. otherwise, changes to the preferences are stored in a local sysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">At the lilo - Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard running speed on a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; available under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you'll need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services are launched in these distributions, is simplified the configuration of the proprietary integration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please verify that all configuration files are required (and even if they are located in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply stop without a message when your configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can be even different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information on Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & cuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you made changes, you need to save them. either you use the respective icon of the tool bar or the entry store in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two postcards, the user and user group list. to edit the user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have enabled the constraints (Quota) for users enabled, a carton card can be made on which you can make individual settings. other cards appear if shadow passwords or example / etc / master.passwd are installed as BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card system passwords appears if shadow passwords or example / etc / master.passwd can be installed in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least a embedded filesystem (Quota) enabled and initialized (recognizable to the quoted a.s / quota.group on the file system). here, for every user parameter, each user can be modified, each data can be found in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected using the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The board map groups inform about the group height of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, you will find a prime group in the field. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by selecting this in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select adding to the user or group or click on the matching drive button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group is analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the lilo-boot manager, remove the bog word, remove and change the time until the booting of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
