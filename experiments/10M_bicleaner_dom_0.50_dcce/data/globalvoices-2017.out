although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would have lived there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American music has been dancing , American authors have been read and run to sport .
in fact , this country had a deep profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of a American film .
as 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible reporter with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura student who had occupied his interest to occupy his interest .
I was imprisoned .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else I would like to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA had only increased .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find in a community of equal people .
I even had a very sh@@ y love letter concerning his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with his narrow face .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks of a former colleague , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever met by the Party nominated candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ illi@@ ons person , did I ask myself ?
I could not defeat Tr@@ ump and His voters in line with people who I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , receives people from all over the world , a deep gl@@ itter@@ ing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ umps is not able to agree with Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance is also standing in contrast to the great gener@@ osity , which I experienced when Sandy B@@ ahr , who also strug@@ gles with the environment , and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
it still fits them to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and wor@@ m@@ wood and helped us to acc@@ use us of the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me much in my career .
these people and those by them em@@ bo@@ unded ways to deep@@ en my love in America .
while in his way , Tr@@ ump made its way to the nominated Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans - mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump , because they either share its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke out .
maybe it &apos;s un@@ fair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as R@@ assi@@ sts .
to be assigned to people , one of my friends said is exactly what has led to us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , have voted , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important ?
perhaps . maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nic , who comm@@ utes the cruel decision to raise a man who looks like him who looks like him who looks different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( eg@@ . ) . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word game made of white in play on the White and whi@@ ch@@ ash , which means that great Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world estimate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have , America is welcomes everyone .
for this country has chosen twice as his President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world .
with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , however , a huge part of the white Americas has this promise , and says : to Hell with mani@@ fold , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the United States after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at rest , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; roaring the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if anyone who is not so as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a lon@@ ely and powerful &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was corrected 36 hours later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the message .
and all the people like Mr. Khan could find no more place in this new America .
and it breaks me my heart .

out of the misery of the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t leave their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish .
the &quot; recycling of Instruments &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic city Cat@@ eur@@ a together ?
that the music , which is played at both places , is not only changing the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is situated on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colom@@ bian ruins and its world famous kitchen .
for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the municipality : a symph@@ ony orchestra , which has its musical instruments , has the possibility of conqu@@ ering poverty .
a musical school with 100 students had become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the ban@@ den violence .
but after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had ever offered a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group seriously , the local news Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI says :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they race through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the bust@@ le they learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ bre@@ l , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village which is practically on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in the Russian capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with restored instruments made from local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez started to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , C@@ elli , double bass , guitar , sa@@ x@@ ophone , trumpets , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made from gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , remembers the starting time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , to contact the parents in gar@@ bage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something which he had never seen before : a pig out of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments made up of friendly material , which is called the recycling of the Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Wa@@ land@@ fill ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest , as people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring play from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra played its music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work successfully fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that used the wild illegal fishing .
this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated at the Cuban waters of illegal fishing before it was seeking the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised over accordingly , a little slo@@ ped , a law crimin@@ als of this type to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ intern , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized rapidly against the ship . they refused to raise one of their ports and ref@@ using to share a fishing mig@@ rating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Prime Minister surrounded by lands that you simply refused everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authorities . it is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and pursued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it wasn &apos;t able to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protected resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries in 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network in addition to Somalia and Madagascar are the six countries that had driven the Premier out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries which are equal and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where there is illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ he@@ Char@@ ge &apos;s project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides for F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is not regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to apply for it . illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and ways are to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which means a del@@ ic@@ ate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once guarded by bureau@@ cratic hur@@ d@@ les , and through the snow @-@ emp@@ iri@@ cal hur@@ dle , the actions dates back in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news to susp@@ ects activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a harbor spec@@ tion .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very thou@@ ght@@ ful when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships which fishing in forbidden areas - such as susp@@ icious driving rou@@ ds - such as those who suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing license , where they were on the way and perhaps if they have a criminal off@@ s .
countries that are against illegal fishing catch may refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships can &apos;t sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay from pen@@ alties , as in the case of Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are considerable financial losses for the owners , which means illegal fishing is finan@@ cially worthwhile anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ restrial company which establishes itself for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the platform already mentioned above was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH network each year because of illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate to East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish stocks , absent for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among other practices , actions include like the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake lic@@ ences , indication of imag@@ inations , fish protected species and the fishing in protected areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international collaboration , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you didn &apos;t want to run my harbour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch is trying to close F@@ ISH D@@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inception , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has revealed criminal networks uncovered , the f@@ ake licenses used in Tanzania . there discovered ships , which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found them fle@@ eing ships and found them .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for crimes committed , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations take us quite far into the networks of organiz@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to be susp@@ icious in precise ships .

the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed further , helps to open up illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Che@@ fan@@ aly@@ st with Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO who also deals with fish@@ eries and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch to an example of their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ge@@ ared by satellite .
Cop@@ eland thus helps to build a system which connects different information panels . it is said to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find a criminal ship with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually influence influence on the evi@@ dently global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of each tra@@ ce@@ able vessel worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it , who does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities may not only sense crime , but also sc@@ are .
ships , who previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license , and barely had to be reck@@ oned with consequences , know now that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH focused countries now have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , selling more licenses since fishing boats .
after F@@ ISH had assisted j@@ ko 1 , Gre@@ ko 1 invented the inspec@@ tors there on board tra@@ w@@ ls , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we also copy other countries , &quot; said Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study objective . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will van@@ ish by illegal fishing annually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , at the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting the goal of allowing more such initiatives and structures in other regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country began to report on his first big triumph in Somalia . in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under a false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used to use tra@@ pp@@ ies that are now prohibited .
the ship was also still in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the creation of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go forward to illegal fishing catch , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative work@@ ings to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the Government of Venezuela denied the opposition to a referendum on a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ ti@@ ans attacked the political and economic crisis in the country in whose eyes were gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return order of Venezuela ) can be found in both images of these demonstrations as well as arguments and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat @-@ area Bar@@ inas , in the regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central north @-@ west federal budget Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , resulting in the everyday life of the Vene@@ ti@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition , in the term of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , saw the chance to change a fundamental change ; however , a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in its latest article in the context of governmental decision as follows :
in the context of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence is the highest in all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine was the sole way to conquer its institutional structures , and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral success of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or shortly mud ( approx . : round table of the Democratic Unity ) , on October 27 , will join the opposition to the majority of representatives of the opposition . here , the trial was planned to continue to continue by President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the appeal was commented on Twitter under such as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is as far as Venezuela : a National Assembly , on Fri@@ days &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , and on November 3 all went to Caracas to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter I have images to tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially big waves beat the message through police repression to the central north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement prior to the police and armed forces of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to keep police forces , including those woman in the T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira state :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira carry no co@@ ats , because anything else could see what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , there is already an info@@ graphic that forms the magnitude of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed by the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counterpart in question - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of more inn@@ umer@@ ical people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s add :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado ass@@ ert that 1 % of the signatures are f@@ ake .
here is your keeper !
on the road !
others analyse this protests as a further step in the fight against a government , made out of their sight , little against the devastating economic crisis , leaving rather to leave critical voices to be silent .
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ es always take more frequencies and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or to go shopping .

this is a adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Córdoba .
as a meanwhile grown man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba , against his father .
the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 were committed to crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not feel his life .
starting with the Bür@@ de , the same name as his father had to carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he maintained his family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was right .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years you won &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not recognize that my father was a thief , which was a thief and a rob@@ ber .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mor@@ ter officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had seen the extent of atro@@ cities in the course of the years that he had experienced as a boy , and who had said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent of his child and like this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me up to the military base , I often walked with us in the sports hall . there , I had hired me with a boy who made mar@@ tial sport .
they all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photograph and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a dick@@ head , you have explored you with one of the ER@@ P .
just notice that you will not leave you one day and I will have to rescue you .
the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation ER@@ P stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army , the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
therefore he gave me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
this was all possible documents : University closures , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ eurs , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ So the prisoners are tortured . &apos;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blanket of wrap and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were turned and maintained me with a guard posts .
suddenly he pointed out to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in , and saw a song that were tortured on the people .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were fixing the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been folded there .
they caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , g@@ ushed him with water and pursued a load of 220 Vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itali@@ a .

the smell there was in it ... like a dirty win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same sm@@ elling came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and me became clear that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were worn at eye .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian that was also indicted in the process ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people lay with the face down - all were bound by hands and feet .
near the entrance k@@ ins@@ ulated people silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you gu@@ ilt , evil ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why didn &apos;t you bring me anything else ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero defeated a man there and killed it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of civil society Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was charged with the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , headed by the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the road that you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped here came here .
when you look at the map you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
their names were changed here and they were assigned as part of the process of dis@@ closure a number .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be transferred .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ ic@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War h@@ ue &apos;
my father had all possible stolen things with home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was on the military myself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military pro@@ clamation that they fought against an enemy .

but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , who gro@@ aning on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried ,
when you go so far , I will find you and bring you strange .
we don &apos;t need any other !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memories of him .
when I came out in the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I wore a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater from wool . both of them had my father out of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ sp@@ iny on this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to tell .
&quot; the disappearance of the dead is the last vile act &quot;
now , wherever I am older , I feel free .
I have children . if one has only one children , one recognizes the value of a life .
it develops and recognizes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so well , you have executed during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why do children perform ?
one day my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could not have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
did these people not have families , which could be transferred to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the dead is the last ab@@ ov@@ able act , which you can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they hol@@ ed machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were gr@@ ind and disp@@ osed somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains forever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you have killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to clari@@ fy it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was on the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the idea to show my father was created during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience him because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ sin@@ king and asked me to tell what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you say something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horri@@ ble crime and you are forced to take me as a child .
he only said &quot; No , but I forgive me . &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
I picked up the first ad in 2010 .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can take to me that I was pre@@ set . I finally said it to my own father .

an translation of translation makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the transmission errors at a center in Kyoto , where you can renew his driving licence .
the picture was dissemin@@ ated in social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driver &apos;s license , in the last month we have witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ rei@@ thorn sh@@ a ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; perhaps - perhaps - perhaps also with ar@@ id back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was diverse in the social media .
the mistake was given to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n has written :
&quot; how could things come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult for elderly people and in an international city such as K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hol@@ mes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ correct English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; Im@@ drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , if it will not be replaced with the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture compl@@ ained for translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already included in the text they had received the translator and that the translation was not checked in their accuracy before it was published .
a log@@ gers reported as follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; it is sorry that older people felt in@@ adequate due to in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our side , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News set itself somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ oted as an adequate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but the reason for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this represents a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens received 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this means that their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors in the same period has increased during the same period .
the named repor@@ ters published in the published version of article comments on the Light that show that preliminary parts apparently show some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation of translation received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how defective is the translation not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that it is a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why is the &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; spread throughout Asia so far
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gra@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery mine for this bizarre error in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lat@@ ors are varied .
to transfer two important skills you need : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to use active voice knowledge to transmit it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is in the case of mother@@ boards . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the language of the mother@@ boards .
in this case , a French mother &apos;s language should be translated from English to French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies don &apos;t employ workers with English as a mother tongue , to make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers who would have to learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees , but they have translations delivered by their English knowledge . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best one , to trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad their language skills are really .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
mach@@ elle translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ying and sel@@ ective propositions which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique is still not able to replace a human translator for a long time . this is valid for some languages .
some of the strange English patterns in Japan , including those tra@@ ded prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sti@@ ble reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry is still acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . however , by large enterprises or from the government that have the funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
the city of Kyoto takes care of a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and police action on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fen ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users found that they no access to the online broad@@ caster Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet access is not accessible from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV .
other online stations also over@@ taken recordings of the protests in Caracas , organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , which the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos Di@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is closed , and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ensu@@ r : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezuel@@ an provider are locked again .
this is from the side of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
quot@@ ations like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
since 2014 traditional media are hes@@ itated on protests against protests . at that time , the Commission of telec@@ ommunications threatened them with fin@@ es and closure when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; Call of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
I log@@ ged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again without cable TV and informative national television channels .
it is surprising that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ a later confirmed that there were not only Viv@@ op@@ lay by a locking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website on which the National Assembly delegates its sessions .
previous research agency of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers can also use DNA . this is a technique to answer the DNS server of certain domains by the DNS server .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server is in@@ correct or ref@@ using to appeal to such a website .
we confirm DNS Sper@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ per@@ spir@@ alled canal , the transmission on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ camera is Elvis Flo@@ res , who had been taken live in Caracas to Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten while he was found in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V was released again .
although some channels are accessible via YouTube , the government also reported that the Internet connections are regulated : thus , the Internet connections will be regulated by access to multi @-@ media coverage than the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , a lot of girls will become slave to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness testimonies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who became exactly how they have victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Ele@@ cted , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ aster cows , fest@@ ed schools &quot; ) , which is processed and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she did not work together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned once again into the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her , she said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the one , from which it turned out , &quot; said she .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one den@@ otes the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money over her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned in this case is that the children can afford to work countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be lifted as part of a contract .
this practice described as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that f@@ ights for the rights of boys and girls .
in this case , she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected witness announ@@ cements and den@@ ounced them .
they tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who hold their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society , and can make something out of itself , &quot; to another family . &quot;
on the other hand , the family that receives the girls and whose exploitation with the faith justi@@ fies that they would give someone a chance , otherwise no training would be , and maybe even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
if the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience it many years later .
sometimes they have never experienced it .
in January 2016 , the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín arrived at the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe strokes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former military tribunal of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official ministry .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira surrendered to Mar@@ ín , until she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment of the young girl &apos;s life .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they were praying that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or C@@ dev@@ cu@@ ela did the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ ischen society of the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest comments and demanded that there will be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among whom conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a rapid study of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison by Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo .
when the case comes before judgment , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be refer@@ ral , when the first time in the history of Paraguay was a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go on judgment .
the daily Life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their old age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , who worked in her father to sign the course of her father and lost his father &apos;s work .
their brothers had to work out and started to sell on the street or on the market of swe@@ ets to earn money .
they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the city of As@@ unci@@ ón in the city of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
in this case , she had to share the time so that you still stayed there for learning .
she stood at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days for example cleaned the refrigerator , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and the infected soil .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she was never star@@ ving , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the Library of the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she reminds me .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the master &apos;s master , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to the opposition from 1954 until 1989 .
at some end of the end , the master of the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and to read the position of opposition flights such as &quot; Sen@@ dero or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them to grant no faith to the reports of the official media on the regime &apos;s regime .
he kept them intel@@ lig@@ ently for intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain to her . &quot; the master of the house had found someone who talked about politics as he spoke about politics . &quot;
&quot; they were not often allowed to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad An@@ habits . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ ani would speak .
their Lord feared because they were the formation they had enabled them to lose again , explains them .
it was , however , entirely clear that she had paid for everything she was paid with her hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , are mob@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ ad@@ itas if they go to school .
because the other children have their parents , they immediately acknowledge that someone who has no parents , has a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I couldn &apos;t leave anyone at home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to any group .
isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s cities in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
for learning .
please contact you .
start from Monday when possible .
the display was given five &quot; Li@@ kes , &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleventh girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who came from Van@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third comment , a girl from the inner inner that would like to work . &quot;
then the author of the display was still another one :
dear friends , I have found one . I look at if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the Cri@@ mean Report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Pap@@ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long ? ) , a collection of witness announ@@ cements , former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
during our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( one economic system during the Spanish conquest ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ adors have had to pay tribute to the Spanish conqu@@ erer in Paraguay . so it is not to justify that many girls and boys go to a system of slavery in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill to design@@ ate Egyptian users social media in order to register with the government

published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently agreed to &quot; agreed to &quot; Regulation concerning the regulatory and commercial social networks . &quot;
when it is accepted by Parliament , users must register users of social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be established that is contra@@ cted to share civil servants and citizens to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users would have to register users on the site of the site with their real names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it will be missed , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fin@@ es .
the bill , consisting of six par@@ agraphs , and You@@ z@@ 7 and Egypt are Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ or application that runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law en@@ act when it is accepted , since the draft does not give reference to how Egyptian authorities are supposed to raise the user &apos;s users , not to register before the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , member of the legislative and promot@@ er of the law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name , and a password to come by the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to create a fire@@ wall on the national level around the Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for the Egyptian and Egyptian , to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known to date that such plans exist .
experts from local experts are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the slaughter .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; General Research Institute &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , declared Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , this means that they will be a strong monitoring system to filtr@@ ate citizens who apply for hom@@ olog@@ ation or not . and this means a crazy system to super@@ v@@ ise the activities of the people , and also to put it to a court process .
technically , this is not a realistic yet - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft on the legisl@@ atures of Parliament and the Constitutional committees must be discussed before it comes to the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in which sense will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ ke ordered a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality , which was intended to be found guilty of imprisonment for those responsible for being guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

a sub@@ species of the bigger family of leop@@ ards , who strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to the loss of Wil@@ der , the loss and of frag@@ mentation of their living space , and as they always find fewer lo@@ ot , at risk .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as Raz@@ a in the video , &quot; Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually can be seen in the wild bo@@ bs@@ lei@@ gh track and goes to zero . as the team in the video therefore set that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a , breaks out in pure joy .

in early March 2017 , in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , which had been achieved in the last six years , had been affected by the &quot; thre@@ e@@ ased disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ f@@ ec@@ pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished all coastal cities from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , because of this reason alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows a local point of view which was reached six years later in order to re@@ construct the life of local companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re @-@ regulatory authority as well as the survey results of those affected by themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( which is to be brought back in , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were registered Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with 70 percent its final light .
although still , six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ees from Beh@@ b@@ fs@@ emp@@ ties have been trying to deal in final spare @-@ homes for six years , even six years after the disaster .
after the three @-@ way catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in containers .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodations .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in Not@@ withstanding , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ates were transferred to the disaster in containers of homes , were transferred to final homes .
for I@@ v@@ ata , this figure is 34 percent .
the work and daily life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
just as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , its doors up to December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
almost 100 percent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation again in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries have resumed their operations .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have suffered great importance .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hima in the &quot; nuclear re@@ zone &quot; zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered well again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand as opposed to the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still weighs 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper conducted numerous frag@@ mentation under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsun@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respondents say that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture .
in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the position of evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture also had a witness for the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols , atomic fact that had to be experienced in Japan .
almost 63 000 people were evacu@@ ated outside the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima near Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in early 2016 , more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima in early 2016 .
still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their home @-@ pre@@ fecture in 2017 .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees still occur in containers , are over 50 years old . they were able to compete for reconstruction efforts of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences may seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , one recognizes however often that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our advantages , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep po@@ d@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention than they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly to someone about speech and country borders .
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man tells us how the love of music has spread to Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time they worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

to the right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva found on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer in front of Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia was beaten with a head@@ room against the head . nationwide , millions of prot@@ esters have participated in a protest against au@@ sterity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and have now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly in Brazil a few days .
on the pictures , the face of police officers is also recogni@@ zable with an impact attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the completion of the investigation into the event .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen for six months on TV and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ic@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , distributed video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several wash@@ es shortly after it .
another video of the same scenes , but is filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in the social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , which lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ lians ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to provide a part of the cost of medical treatment and to remain in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while it is located in the hospital .
&quot; be vali@@ ant , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been divided into social networks several times .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás in memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás witnessed a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assassin@@ ated in secondary schools . here , the military police started to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y Movement . and now we have had the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen , who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen who struck him with a head@@ stock .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where in the past Friday , brutal police officers came against prot@@ esters .
polic@@ emen were in the center of Rio de Janeiro in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had constructed a stage for speakers , rubber shells and tear gas .
the member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked police via loud@@ speakers to refra@@ in violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again , the Brazilian media has been dist@@ orted by changing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window plate .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a targeted glass window to create and create a photo @-@ page image with a photo .
on the other hand the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a fire @-@ set bus .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause .
this must also be seen if one is strictly opposed to any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also given an absurd factor , and the typical violence of the military police are extingu@@ ished by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages are forgotten in Cuba by the Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso completed nearly hundreds of sugar tube factories in the whole of Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Municip@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a Central - on Spanish sugar mill , regardless of what there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar @-@ on @-@ site .
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar tube factory .
after getting there , the sugar tube industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
another autograph@@ ed and com@@ mute every day to the factories that are gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an that rises every day at 4 : 00@@ am , the crisis in the sugar tube industry did not take away his sleep .
he heard that there are su@@ gar@@ s factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after long in@@ active time because they were preserved .
this was something that he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remembers very clearly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i would get the sugar tube factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tube industry resi@@ sted the plagues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ iti , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
by 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the produced in 1910 .
the news about a few decades ago would have been a motive for the country , but the bad awakening are not yet any more new .
why was the Cuban sugar tube industry switched off ?
the old platform of the village has already seen better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar tube industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically se@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they were unbe@@ atable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production ratio was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories which can produce su@@ gar@@ s for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the crisis rise in the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar have to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report of &quot; agricultural proletariat &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the sugar cane would generate at about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day with security in history , &quot; this was the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the breast@@ feeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respondents say the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to preserve the place , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters started to emerge in front of the first time .
it was officially recognized by the documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ am Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any removal .
from then on the responsibility of the responsibility and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the specified factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar @-@ owned sugar @-@ tube factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory , where the construction he helped .
with each part , which he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers was wiped out .
in many cases , no alternatives for the work places and services were generated , where they were present in the municipalities in which they were present .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , then the then president in the eyes of the present people looked as it was guaranteed that for the areas of which factories have not been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar tube factory
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by high @-@ margin .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Municip@@ ality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things will change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to stop them , they also listened to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , this also dis@@ advantage other farms .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were shared to spare parts .
without the future pro@@ spective , many young people left the region .
in the area a grocery factory was created , which production serves not even for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
ninety @-@ nine harvest@@ ing the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i .
Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and cle@@ arer voice , is no re@@ tra@@ geous person , but he for@@ gives the lies that you told him .
they have been doing it for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in strength but because it is forbidden .

youth of the First Nations communities in all of Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do the job with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour since 2014 workshop uses mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to accommodate youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were guided by ped@@ agog@@ y David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North American with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then with Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop means that the young participants in convers@@ ations like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever makes them sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &quot; Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , even &quot; highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ esis Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to con@@ vey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs despite the influences is due to glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people do not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation is recorded , the refra@@ in is sung at Cre@@ e .
the youth involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a St@@ anza in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ie page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , St@@ rop@@ he is available in a tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like it would not be interested in me
but I continue to go on earth for my days
this is the day that you will remove our cry
because we have lost our way in life for our youth
but I believe that we will rise to one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how she lives a bad life
that is how they can grow and advance to our youth .
so they can do that for which she has directed the Creator

in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see in front of almost every restaurant of plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exposed to the entrance of sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( that is to be taken away , &quot; Pla@@ stic Models of the dishes &quot; ) from any food served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small companies that produce the plastic dishes that the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a about 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are usually found that they do not even show them more . a new trend is transformed , however , in con@@ spic@@ uous cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome the B@@ log@@ it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic dishes , decorated cell tapes , as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ ten collection objects like in this case , refriger@@ ate .
here are a couple of Sho@@ ku@@ hin fri@@ dges for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food orders will become increasingly elab@@ orate .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this three @-@ square bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part we manufactured for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to view like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing landing .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ic@@ ura and salmon have been used , a popular t@@ opping with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :

a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug tra@@ ders . &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media over the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ xes and killed regularly occur in statistics . however , this mirror did not reflect on the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle is bringing with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the boss of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ on , pressed the stories of the victims of conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone of bones in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners who may never heal their wounds .
this is why the Mexican News portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learn a voice ) with the drug traffi@@ cking , and stories of people who were fighting between prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and will need to drive all the municipalities so many kilometers to buy something as low as milk .
pain of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; how anxiety life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father &apos;s sister , her four brothers and sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have put to us , and go to the graves after the men who have loved us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , there is no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid out because that ask for a death certificate .
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only need to show the faces of those who fear fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the State guidance .
the project is based on readers of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader from Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with the disease and sens@@ ing journ@@ alism now for some years now .
I pass every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover page with pictures which actually can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or the files of specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one who is ra@@ yed or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be con@@ spic@@ uous , or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is great ( German : drug re@@ ta@@ iler ) if it is big . and it &apos;s not normal for people to hear about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me , this is what they would have lost those who have lost somebody and those who have fear to them so something .
I see our weakness , when stories become naked numbers in a statistic .
the human el@@ ess@@ ness of mankind is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , that they were &quot; sow@@ ed . &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , unless they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months &quot; pressing in the main city districts . &quot; she describes how armed crime happened for month &apos;s money from their business , until she was not only destroyed the business , but also her family had torn apart .
you think of everything you have lost , and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain will never die , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if there is absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they can withdraw you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if you want to dissolve my deep root emotions , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the entry &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the hand @-@ made generation . &quot;
in the introduction , he asks questions on how : who cares about the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by the organized crime ?
how is it to rise up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a commodity , and he tells himself that he had to teach himself , how to make a egg , potatoes , tortillas , make tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the fl@@ ake with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg , one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for which the whole life is made of violence and learning to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he saw a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father had been shot by armed men from a driving car .
as Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence through the organized crime and the struggle against them had been mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders according to the Federal Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the Pro@@ secution declared 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are only a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul .
only a few stories live in view of getting new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we don &apos;t forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking in the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words ,
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages where he is linked , contain images on which violence is depicted .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it comes to raise a rum@@ or or dis@@ lar@@ ed a UFO ho@@ ax .
but how is this year after something that has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether it is true or un@@ true , to continue to exist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been used to execute mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar in fact .
this false meaning of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it th@@ rows questions to our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cking and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war of Africa &apos;s second largest country was negle@@ cted and thus devast@@ ated , the streets in the region had become dangerous pl@@ ou@@ ghs that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to the tan@@ ker .
government officials described a fire ball , dozens of dozens , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who clearly explained the soccer World Cup .
the houses of crum@@ bled and lo@@ oted bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to im@@ pedi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one image with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of carbon@@ ized body , which are excited on the ground for people to watch them .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years , the same photo was quen@@ ched several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but was unable to imp@@ ose real @-@ related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an settlements Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically about atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay down in streets and prayers .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed but no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said one of Human Rights Watch .
many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time only was shown on the basis of satellite imag@@ ery .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely regarded as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ bre@@ vity of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of errors ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass@@ ages .
one step further bring forth personal comments as this example , as an example from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined forces with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in appearance .
according to a flash announ@@ cements , published by the United Nations , those who could flee blows , rape and several dead , some caused by fail@@ ing .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , pat@@ rons , such as the following , made these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab News page , which in 2012 claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians would have been involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to shoot this information .
the original entry , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , AFP and source , had also called Th@@ an Being this statement , but had not thus brought the picture from DR Congo in connection to them .
the wide range of false information
traces of these wrong coupling cl@@ amps reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far more information can exceed borders .
a reverse image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they originate from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and common publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , and others have tried to lar@@ ed the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have so@@ aked examples of the abuse use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they have been published . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the listed countries ( which in some cases also inter@@ connected with each other ) , several examples are to be used for mis@@ use use .
here are some cases which can now be felt completely . ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
state @-@ examples of false copy of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries have access to pages or servers , which are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or false messages .
the countries in grey are examples that according to the metad@@ ata and information that are available via the Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

in this article , a log@@ gers from Quebec City does not only call the mis@@ use of the images from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions concerning the int@@ entions of persons and the past@@ ures ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( which is not known whether the original report has the image included ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ es du@@ es after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am like this here , which used the picture from DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities committed by Islam , have clearly seen any pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that resi@@ sts this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ot@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , the Nobel Peace Prize winner . &quot;
this article describes the continued emergency of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quoted the work of an article by Indian Express with the picture from DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express was not included in the time of publication of our contribution to this picture .

this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed ni@@ otic Christians .
this statement was ref@@ uted by a Greek fac@@ ulty check page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a association of students of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the illustration of the DRC image .
Italy , 2015 .
a residents of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o by Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo has been shown as a proof for the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ bre@@ vity of the picture from DR Congo , with one part of a twe@@ et , sympath@@ y against the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand of a blo@@ g@@ ist , the alleg@@ ations , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya have been persecuted , since the photos were used to mis@@ use .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a right position as &quot; deliber@@ ately f@@ aked news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understanding in terms of Myanmar . &quot;
this correct position , which is published exclusively on English , also includes references to f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ours that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and the other ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , states that the Image of the DR Democratic Republic of Congo indicates that Christians kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page was fal@@ sely claiming that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an has been involved in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release , the picture remains in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 concerning students who had been murdered by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Church site An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly stated that the picture was not written by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; hair@@ y attack . &quot;
when the Picture of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre was put into circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to prove that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ band@@ ed a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the connection to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris in 2015 .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took part in these events that took place in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered as evidence of the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre was put into circulation , there were discussion forums such as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the Co@@ unter@@ feit message .
from the Embassy in which the BIL@@ D of the DRC was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were submitted .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , the inks are also not completely re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / data sheet exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and if they have image files related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture finally carries a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) that pier@@ ces these posts . the first frame focus on Religion .
the photograph was used in terms of larger discussions regarding silence in the relationship with the kill@@ ings of Christians or - for the defence of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming has used the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to European or French life .
religion wants to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth watching how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if the readers of these pictures can no longer be trusted .
with social media , there are few people who are un@@ intenti@@ onal to pract@@ ise the water around a tragedy .
suggests that the mood of the false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the ref@@ usal of ref@@ using images to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , concern that violent images and audience dis@@ si@@ zing them and take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ y Emp@@ emp@@ ath@@ y ( such as this study , who examined how violent media act on it , others ) .
while there are a lot regarding non @-@ violent represent@@ ations in the media media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
technical experiment@@ ing experim@@ ented with algorith@@ ms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will thoroughly think about situation , in which a picture can be suggested , but what actually can be used from context or in completely mis@@ sive way .
any examination of false revers@@ al should also be considered as international as they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. in@@ fi@@ duci@@ ble ) is trying to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ or@@ esa ) .
but all resist hard times every try of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , for example is a full explanation , and sometimes something that is needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have already been collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists deal Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and L@@ ingu@@ is by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog , for example , words from the Greek language of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Dis@@ miss your parents in recognition of what you have tried in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or sl@@ oth that you feel after being washed in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words out of his blog above :
they shook other cultures , un@@ veil other ideas and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the L@@ ingu@@ ists on this page you want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are very much appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to invite their favorite animals here .

the Women &apos;s March 21st is March 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .

it was approved in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I confi@@ de her my four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children , she is my rock in the field .
in the one minute we will call par@@ ol@@ es for the rights of women .
in the next step we will en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of rain@@ l@@ las and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ical picture of a woman with head@@ cloth high , bound from an American flag , other r@@ ens par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girlfriend looks at me and said , &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not a nut@@ ty ? &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people , with whom I have been working or people who have met me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has been built in their perception .
they need to blend me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we pract@@ ise our religion differently .
we recognize that to be a Muslim , on different kind . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective performance so well that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit there , must be mus@@ cled .
kidn@@ apping shall be kidn@@ apped
I don &apos;t understand that alone .
this is even the poet that Po@@ etry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim schol@@ ar and the schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad , were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western idea the religion was cleared by Rum@@ is as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion does a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims from this world .
another one consists in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been developing western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing language is determined by the dark man you should be afraid and the exotic woman to save .
the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward Said destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures rise again today .
our politicians , the news industry , and Hollywood are continuing to continue .
I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , in@@ correct nar@@ rative domin@@ ate our news@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative domin@@ ates the reality that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from it , their pil@@ lows in public buildings carry and su@@ cked @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , that these two sides of the same coin .
a mighty group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ rative , the Muslim women , to conduct the movements of change .
it looks across the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , the ones were brought here with slaves .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has become so deep and f@@ law@@ ed by our collective imagination , that often Si@@ kh Men and children are aimed at anti @-@ tim@@ ental attacks and sc@@ ans .
because of these stories , which we tell them and because of the way we tell them , Islam is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion units
in the News industry , we do more than only stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry failed to failed to capture the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of all Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author was 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live in their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American statist@@ icians from Bangladesh with the name of the Rah@@ man Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan saw the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ ra@@ zed Muslims and Americans .
but I &apos;m an und@@ ated mus@@ ky and American now ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say , instead of my Muslim recipes , or that all Muslims bear with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ per W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ umped together , we do not bear all T@@ ash@@ eb@@ bles with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ever for an additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight the lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islamic refin@@ ery , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for counter@@ feit information that is our already in@@ correct picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the nature we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger that burns a cloth .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques around the USA , see below .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a nut@@ shell but was only born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour is watching my rock in the fire that I am mus@@ ky if they look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ al rit@@ ual with my daughter , if I keep them silent in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Quran , which can be called the Quran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil that you can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim states is always part of my shadow .

it &apos;s the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a basket with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with an hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be close by heart .
to be a nut@@ ty , to speak the prayers they had said to me , when I have a bad day .
to be in this body , how she has taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that was established over centuries - through a &quot; imperi@@ alists &quot; approach , created a company with the name of hon@@ ours British Eastern des company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by colon@@ ists who have divided the Muslim world like at risk .
to be a nut@@ ty , to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to be colonial to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped by a Muslim country prior to a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , a Indian , sin@@ cer@@ ative subject to the British Empire , referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim strain of 1.7 billion , deep in our unforgettable family trees are back ; our in@@ av@@ ant history .
it is to remind that fourteen years ago the most powerful army of the world , with troops over every continent , had been distributed to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction , which did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
an American Muslim climate means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy will pun@@ ish the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story of four times more than a story with a white ass@@ ass@@ in .
it means to know that four@@ ten years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to name an American hero .

the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion cubic metres has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ess , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
a mother means to care for my child , and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ fully and privileged individuals are er@@ ect on this two @-@ year structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that covers its borders against people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which are largely Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are wars that we lead and the bombs we throw in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title of Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University team showed a scientifically documented picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conf@@ ections that we must guide
we are too deep dar@@ ing to enth@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; Other &quot; .
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ts and dangerous expression , which we re@@ compens@@ ate in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast sea Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ ling ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ cle Bad@@ Muslim ; The vir@@ ale video erie Secret Li@@ ves of America ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sho@@ es Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increased Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences which go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy theories , that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the white house .
they are expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has expon@@ enti@@ ally grown by making the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not been given them ; now they have ruled large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the history , which I was not aware of when I was so old as I am now my daughter , but that made me a missing muscle .
things I have left here like a piece of bread in my speech .
things , who perhaps aw@@ aken of memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ctions that makes our humanity , a story may listen where someone is made to another . &quot;

we have to make ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of this , aware and washed the &quot; other &quot; as it is my girlfriend and I , in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , did we believe that we have no pre@@ sidents , while he already occupied countries and &quot; too other &quot; people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion people .

Initiative for Er@@ otic Art wants to preserve urban diversity .
history count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be one way , here and now in spite of a language barrier to someone in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently over another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is a try to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the framework of the project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avoided , if we create cities , receive gas@@ ousness - safe spaces , in which residents do not have to forget who they are to be added .
while &quot; listening to this is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to perceive , to feel , to build , make it up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , histori@@ ans write their story at first in their own language and translate or explain it to English .
even if participants are not a professional history count , their devot@@ ion and their account will result in ensuring that the audiences can be touched upon it .
they call laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the D@@ assi@@ dat@@ or R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the story of typical art @-@ rob@@ bers for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel from the har@@ es and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
after expl@@ aining the importance of its Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ let it divi@@ des his feeling of the wise :
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
to date , the events of the Treasure Language stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all that are inspired by the project can take into contact with T@@ LS to organise their own skills .
Puerto Rico demands new debt reduction from the USA
with the aim of a new examination for the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tor@@ ped@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ da@@ dan@@ o de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the neur@@ al examination of the liabilities ) and the Ö@@ com@@ en@@ ical Church of Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the new debts of the debt , also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls that politicians , banks and government authorities , who are responsible for the debt , are responsible for their corruption .
we demand a financial inspection and a tap committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , the remun@@ eration that is ag@@ iert in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be able to get rid of the pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the territory of the United States - is suffering under a serious financial crisis .
so , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a pro @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization without Party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state recognition .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ ican requires a major restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside are not subject to the participation and conviction of the citizens of danger , to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ ache for Light and Light . &quot;

the sy@@ ri@@ cally Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions that he performed for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , who is held annually at the annual conference for digital culture , hosted in Berlin , dedicated to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Director of the Book of The Book of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ di@@ bility ( The Cost of Liberty : a collective research ) .
the book , published in the last year and is available free here , contains a number of articles that deal with free culture in the face of supp@@ ression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ le and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to elab@@ orate like mot@@ ions for free knowledge , and what the true expenses are , with which this is associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers , and authors who are involved in the movements of free knowledge , have worked on site to watch over the fog , who gives our news@@ feeds and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and popular Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or position of stay .
the introductory part of his book with the title of his book gives his friends and his family a voice to push back his release and that they want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs ?
since March 2012 , the Web@@ developer of Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police based Bas@@ sel had taken along the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , when the Assad government insi@@ sted and informed them by an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects like Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the Internet and to extend the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical scientist and currently over@@ looked the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ le , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
not one of Bass@@ like cultural prototypes didn &apos;t work more than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually test the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the sign of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here are mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would set aside all these architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this strike train into the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capac@@ itor which will be the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel has not yet stopped this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life with it , to dream of liberty and taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English with him , even when he was already detained in prison .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he has taught other prisoners to read English , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened my gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he gave me the Internet .
he has taught other prisoners as they use computer , at least in theory , without having held a lot in their hands .
in addition , G@@ ha@@ zi is the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting for Wa@@ iting ) , which she wrote in 2012 until 2015 , when he found himself in prison .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
they cl@@ ashed the texts to him when they visited him and he translated them from the Syrian Arab .
the book is license @-@ free .
book@@ end of Y@@ ous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening . &quot;
it happens with every visit ,
that I sin@@ cer@@ ely in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment in which we embrace the poor ,
that every one of the dangers does not matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , gre@@ ts and guards
I forget the time of the prison .
and I penet@@ rate into every detail of your voice , and words ;
whom I bear with passion for me ,
if your eyes fail to say
and I &apos;ll make another piece of my soul with you ...
I immediately return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get all the moments ,
and over your absence to cry and smile .
I bear witness myself that I will return soon ...

bass story is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime were tortured or executed .
by 2016 , Amnesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people will remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we are repe@@ ating our demand in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , director at the provisional release returned to previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption , in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence against the corruption in which the corruption has been committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defendants , was sentenced to 54 million me@@ ti@@ al ( some 800 000 euros ) for 22 years in prison .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was released in 2016 for a good lead and immediately requested his re@@ adjustment to the company , which was done on 19th April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of At@@ tor@@ ney General , there wouldn &apos;t be an obst@@ acle to Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a , once again to refer to his old post , since the company had not performed disciplines after his detention .
however , many citizens do not call the action well .
the center for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , an local institution that establishes itself for public transparency , in an interview with the German Wave , the decision of the company to re@@ prove the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the struggle against corruption , and makes it clear the lack of transparency and even a set@@ back to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we know is that the company should have one disciplinary procedure against the contradi@@ ctions .
the company remained silent , however , and caused no reasonable steps to use the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as &quot; contradi@@ cting &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a would be a competent type , it would be advis@@ able after having been sentenced to a prison term , and half of them served .
he could pay lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and be his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has decided to re@@ integrate into the company , which he helped to hurt damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is gladly paid for his sweat .
conflic@@ ting !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was rewarded from the state , because he rewarded him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded to such a way that has already massi@@ vely in the state .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a is missing the mor@@ ality to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has been operated only by the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a used the state as hand@@ some of the in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ve money source and the state itself is tired of that man , who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long term imprisonment .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a thief belongs to the prison :
th@@ ieves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , who will not only remain as the first independent President , but also as a sharp , one @-@ cutter and by the same way - Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous ren@@ der@@ ings , when he was energetic , affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is ready to be able to sell the father@@ land for his amb@@ itions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn off his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also denied :
Cam@@ b@@ az@@ a was sentenced to 22 years in prison , but he was 10 years old and was released .
and today , at which he de@@ file it , at which he de@@ file it again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ pl@@ y@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Im@@ proves A@@ mu@@ ff ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the ra@@ cial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ki@@ di@@ or@@ se or sp@@ age b@@ ots .

according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the net because they liked the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ ab@@ stain@@ ed .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or in general as ad@@ jec@@ tively &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ n@@ ish script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of Hass@@ ene in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ stain@@ ing con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is usually used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ elt against Muslims , who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight against me in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism in conjunction with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself is not en@@ dowed in Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the use of the word have been cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ se words with basic different mean@@ ings , which have the same accounting sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( winding ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ h@@ ue A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends for a spiritual way , whether they were w@@ aging , how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by making a word game .
the proposition ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ ing ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ o - resembles the ra@@ cial expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they l@@ essen the language of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ised that Facebook has to be analytical to spread all the po@@ ets that de@@ stru@@ ct rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the Autom@@ atic ism is not able to understand what you write on a fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should make , is the post carefully analyse and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these three nation@@ alist nation@@ alists , that Hass@@ elt the language , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action will send a strong signal to all , the effectiveness of this strategy may not cause long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of bu@@ zz is often a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply going to start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored speech to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post@@ ings when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was interested in this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post by Facebook was removed and the li@@ ken , post and parts of content was prohibited for 24 hours , because the post &quot; The Facebook community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a great variety of post@@ ings from people who have no negative int@@ entions , or who simply try to show their opinions against Hass@@ elt radi@@ c@@ ous nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with hate :
post without Hass@@ elt from Facebook .
in the Post , the author presented his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious foundations are poor in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine has believed that Facebook would have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community to question advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words are to be cen@@ sored only by hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they started to have this without local context or technical support , and such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Gen@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have been prohibited .
even when they found that they made a mistake , they did not attempt to report fal@@ si@@ bly deleted platforms .
if they had just a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship is ensured for a lot of fun among users .
rather than taking it seriously , users are now doing fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ h to see if its posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook post@@ hosts , which were not ab@@ stain@@ ed in Hass@@ elt , but still removed :
used with approval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ c text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watching an inheritance of pe@@ cur@@ cur@@ ry and a Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to try out if Facebook removes the Post , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with approval .
the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with approval .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt is to stim@@ ulate violence in the municipalities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been for his interro@@ gation , who were aware of an assassination attempt on his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but instead of shaving the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better current , more likely to move forward in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago at the end of the children &apos;s children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanimously a law unanimously decided to provide this practice , so that the full age of marriage is now 18 .
before this change of a couple of members , some members of religious groups held their religious groups in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ora Mahar@@ aj , a group of representatives of the various religious groups of the country , met that the state should not intervene in the state as that , at age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago had a contract partner of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights , defined by min@@ ors , every person under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago to 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Ministry of Statistics confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that endeav@@ our to abol@@ ish laws for children before , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no concerns , to say the critics of the children of children , they ought to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition seemed difficult for tension in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts that the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the President of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators were re@@ posted on Facebook a status update , which has re @-@ posted by Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against children &apos;s before was decided at a House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them decided .
once he had decided in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
the majority of the social media users was thrilled because the laws were changed for children before .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial minist@@ erial council in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has a lot of time and unnecessary smell , which has veil@@ ed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children before it is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel Jackson made my opinion , it was definitely taken long enough to prevent the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all @-@ Thomas was finally convinced that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ en@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ af@@ ra@@ ding News !
the couple has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
on the following , the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , which was quite openly about the passage of the law noted , noted :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now regardless of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the amendment of the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all MPs , who were contrary to the law , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s children are not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # , mar@@ ri@@ age@@ tian .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ stered him .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thanks to our members .
however , a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ h@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
prior to months Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to undertake a judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to fulfil his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , it is quite right if Mahar@@ aj was against the law wished , most social media users wish to wish to change the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rell proposed to :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion as generally speaking , in a way that we would invite the state into our bedroom , &quot; that it may protect the state that it may benefit from big , hard @-@ driven men who are opposed to them in an advantage , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the child@@ r@@ ens are legal or remains the norm , although there is laws which they under@@ stated .

with the mirrors of Web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia Content again
the Wikipedia articles found in English on January 18 , 2012 , contra@@ dict@@ ory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright Law in the United States , is internationally regarded internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey has now become the popular and the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is more clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and share reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the locking .
although many techniques are used to use revers@@ ing tools for block websites ( a recent article by the New York Times also reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest V@@ PN reward in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia are not allowed in this category .
even though Turkey has been working on Wikipedia articles from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regular block@@ ades of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the platform remains closed , several mirrors are now ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform stopped all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ cent@@ ered pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available , despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set it all to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents of dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content , even if you can &apos;t reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ de org themselves .
IP@@ FS also showed that this step was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and there are only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Cri@@ sti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ zi@@ ong@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page of Wikipedia , when also Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can take advantage of similar Mir@@ ror websites when on Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Moz@@ illa at Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one takes on another URL , which is not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , when they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to attract attention to the need for natural protection

photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly , mot@@ i@@ ven and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ate himself motiv@@ ate him to carry and try to start the situation .
at that time , he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , N@@ ept@@ as , stri@@ ves to bring to the international stage .
and his home right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as he helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world nature heritage . what could it give better for a passionate wild animal photographer ! !
I rested at home just when suddenly in Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ han@@ lodge ) , he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was located and I immediately began to gn@@ ashing pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nep@@ als nature and like to deep@@ en the understanding of it that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening how they look like .
and he should know it , because he was standing by face to face to face :
a tiger can not inter@@ fere with the opinion of sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was too , because of darkness , on the way to home , when suddenly the King of Bu@@ zz@@ ks appeared . he immediately appe@@ als to us and he star@@ red me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for Environmental Protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and wild animals is not always easy .
for 22 days he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take home in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took a photographer and took six to seven days for the perfect photography of birds , which live near the tourist arrivals .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women speak for the first time to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was released here as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands or even by older men in the family .
instead , they use a ron@@ om@@ ist or say &quot; My father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ had@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband because of the social pressure and the fear of the consequences they should have regard the norm to maintain this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted by an Indian state O@@ live a by a head@@ light and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a secret relatives with names .
the tradition of marriage women is not common in the name , is also common among men . however , they do have much less assign@@ ments to fear , if any , they should not come after this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main focus of the city quickly .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the fine details of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is powered by the community of Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and establishes itself for the dis@@ assembly of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of their video camera for seven years on the discovery of practition@@ ers , as children &apos;s marriage up to the associations of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS Indians , and direc@@ ts this club .
she reports about how this clubs formed a safe place for these women and made them at the same time at the time of the wall .
the first video , showing the Roh@@ ini in its discussion group , did not have women who call their husbands at the name .
it has decided on this topic , because they wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that the women could identify themselves easily .
do not hesitate to issue the name of their husbands , is an again responsible for whom they have found guilty , and never questioned him .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who is not holding this will be regarded as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never made ourselves up to this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , had never called the name so far , try out at home how it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in mother and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was too late .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him concerning his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ gage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion group .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members would be a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , sc@@ and@@ alized , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us what they want , that they will not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to visit the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ ak of a century of ancient tradition , in which women married to the name of their husbands never .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y that during the whole exercise there was only a pro@@ strate ; a others decided to leave the entire fru@@ str@@ ative fru@@ stration against him and his family , by cursed him .
the expression on its faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
even in ad@@ renal@@ ine in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , having broken down with an old brilli@@ ance , the women decided that they actually try to call home their husbands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put in the head , his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother in law she star@@ ed her , she was afraid , and said that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of one participant in a course was less under@@ stand@@ able and the situation involved in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of a red @-@ red point on the forehead , pointing to the mar@@ ital status :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the galvan@@ ized red point , if he did it daily .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I listened to him to bear him .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think they are now in a better position to choose even if not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we &apos;ll make a trip on every discussion of discussion .
usually , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; they danced and sang talking about things they had never had imag@@ ined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I have also known about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities have been knot@@ ted to our husbands , as never said to be honest .
it feels great to tell some things loud , no matter how small they occur one .
in a discussion group we have talking about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users , they have not dar@@ ed .
following a lot of war and discussion about the advantages of their own clothing , the mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ ly Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Upper inhibit@@ ing ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a , where they can bear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will make it .
to the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion of discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into rolls :
we have only made small steps to date .
some women tried it a few times , but then they listened to tell the name of her husband .
some , enclosed me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
just one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion group know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the noise of more freedom of movement or its own clothes @-@ election - will be the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , it will realize that they are sitting in the same boat .
as Roh@@ ini explained :
each one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club , each one of us , gives us the confidence that something is going to change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when any woman goes home to home and other people , what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

on June 29 this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was being able to inv@@ ent the whole ( Beatles commemorative day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans split memories and split their appreciation for the Beatles .
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered the tide of the Japanese culture of the post@@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ ha@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964 , observed in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles have been in the land , but this was enough to turn the Japanese .
people really quickly became clear here that they had no choice than the Beatles have received with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retail user Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! the day is the Beatles commemorative day in Japan . it was about 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs from the Beatles have sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke @-@ bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today the Beatles of Beatles is .
we all love in our house The Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on is supposed to represent or not .
and as it belongs to fans , they naturally make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the known places that are related to the band .
whether you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you &apos;ll have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can &apos;t be ag@@ ril enough :
good morning together .
today the Beatles of Beatles is .
exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran through the Abbey Road .
we did the same thing last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base also ver@@ itable , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen &apos;s Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! it is today the Beatles Day of Beatles .
and what could this be a day ?
I will listen to me today &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; and eating R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are here !

a new system of kidn@@ apped people for the organ@@ ist , probably for super@@ faithful purposes , probably troubled the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to the life to stop the practices .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently given them that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ anas in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
it is the local super@@ st@@ ition to believe that the head of a man &apos;s head of gold may be enth@@ used or wealth , the police pre@@ acher of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks have been registered at a gl@@ ass@@ man men in Mozambique .
another group that is aims of assassin@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 initiated a mission in the South African country to examine these practices .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and fighting .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on July 8 , 2017 .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o moved attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to cancer of cancer at the end stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State of State ) after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China has referred to Li@@ ko &apos;s case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and he tells a spokes@@ person he did it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release it or give him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , some are completely removed from the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
s R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ person refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate li@@ u abroad for a treatment .
Norway
the Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into stores after the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to re@@ plen@@ ish the salmon to China , as the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee made his hope for an un@@ conditional release to the expression and invited Li@@ u to pick his award in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the European diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica mo@@ gher@@ ini , has also called for the release of Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
in the same time , we anticipate that China lifts all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ ch dealt with that the Americans said to him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , as far as it is helpful to him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in China &apos;s Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy was asking for the Chinese authorities not only to leave Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the request of the US Embassy moved to an angry response from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; there is no country the right to inter@@ fere with and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following fol@@ lic@@ as :
protection and freedom such as travel and access to the medical care of his choice , based on which they have entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international obligations .
the US Senate , Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz , also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I challenge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o in order to develop into a proper medical treatment . h@@ tt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German Government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s News Agency announced that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could be sur@@ passed by Li@@ u to visit Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called to provide an adequate medical care to the opportunity , giving him the opportunity to provide himself with his family .
Li@@ us attor@@ ney previously told that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always has the room monitored in the hospital , and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls for China to agree on its international human rights , including freedom of expression , the freedom of expression and the rights for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China in a declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he needs , regardless where , are needed . furthermore , his wife and family may contact him .
even though the news channel France Info reported that the French government would welcome the Li@@ u state in the country , there was no further information given to whether France would take it out of it .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the continental affairs in Taiwan called for China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and deplo@@ ying a larger tolerance compared to those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Taiwan , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator reported to allow China to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to allow the sick intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u , and announced that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished , have led to a harmon@@ ious , stur@@ dier and prosper@@ ous China , which once again contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and legal status in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stup@@ id , since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this observation has caused a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the International Office of the State of New York , the minister noticed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , as they were compared to Singapore in other countries .
he under@@ goes that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that is , with most people commit a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ use the Minister of Justice to overthrow the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and benefits offered to create this valuable land , you will say that we will be no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of what he appeared un@@ even non @-@ democr@@ atically .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York . these cities , who are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of author@@ itarian fe@@ a@@ ers , which give them Democrats , leave the dist@@ orted logic , as they fit better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our pol@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
the corresponding questions he clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers rational style .
Rachel Z@@ eng invites you to show his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take care of this point , as far as it was paid high , in order to be part of the city of Singapore .
by launching on the blog his comment , he insi@@ sted on the reviews that it should begin to understand the entire press copy of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore be so un@@ even though we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he promised Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who makes up a growing generation , such as this pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice has said of Singapore very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s a different thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I &apos;m not sure he believes , really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dismant@@ ling the weak spots of Sh@@ an@@ cho@@ g@@ ams objec@@ tions :
has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam has committed a bug , or was there a publisher ?
when Singapore is not a country , we will be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally the country and city .
as he plays an important role in the government c@@ abling , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ bra@@ ve are of serious importance .
why does the Singap@@ ore@@ an advoc@@ ate their military service , defend them only their city or not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink human resources ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
in general , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade was assigned to the affir@@ mation of Singapore , and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have off@@ ended many av@@ eng@@ es ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect at your residence or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous sequence , with rum@@ ors beyond certain parts of the world to be revealed and a different fac@@ et will be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is set to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am living in Canada since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation , by providing personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then the standard answer is followed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly in anger when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t realize it , there is little that different from Americans are different .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian banner well on their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
thus , when I started 20 years ago , the world began to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to differ from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender equality are legal in Canada already since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
we obviously speak very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country with ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it would be nothing for me if someone would like to change Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : as &quot; nice , &quot; to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be careful - just like goo@@ dly , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really were a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
there are no edges and edges , nothing at which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and to make no attention .
that can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around one .
I would even be able to say that the desire is to be free and alone , a major player in Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to worry about our own business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
the warm@@ hear@@ ted , open kindness , which I have now binding with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au went on stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada straight to sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ is@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a musical video which will hold power to the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 hold power and despite their promises to restore civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells it his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the musical video refers to the continued military rule of Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video received 1.@@ 254 times during the first three days and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists urged the public to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and enter@@ taining introduction to the Thai politics as it is , with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that have been har@@ assed by Thailand in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ con@@ ical section of 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which is the Commander in Chief of the Supreme decision making an absolute decision about important national topics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the creation of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered a critic of Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal against , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear prec@@ epts are often used by the authorities to cause activists and other criticism of the state .

the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages in the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya , Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the coal basin of Ab@@ cha@@ sia .
several ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , it is the biggest part of the Russians and the bub@@ bles in the area .
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ cities in Ab@@ cha@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war era more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the municipal population was 16,000 people after having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the buildings are restored and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native old man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why do I speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all the community .
now there is only a paved road with infl@@ atable glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and promoted their contribution to the central part of the Soviet Union , have left the district today .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , there are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in other villages it looks similar .

two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of an destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera , they immediately pull back .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph ourselves , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers up a little girl and suddenly , they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subsi@@ st@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping , and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in the winter the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her eldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ ai to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia Minor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial assistance from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells us that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and to celebrate public holidays .

&quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , calls her to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a couple of time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she remembers the village of Th@@ orn .
despite the relations , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ ti@@ en and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ ch@@ Asia only broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a little more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is getting about $ 9 for every child .
her husband works in the mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once there , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was first a very frigh@@ tening situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost its chan@@ get@@ iness .

many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .
in fact , there was rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember the same day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation nar@@ rowed the end , a little boy is over us over .
he runs through the window of an destroyed building and hiding .
a ball is flying from the window and another boy ch@@ ased out after him .
he plays with the ball , that goes down to the hill .
a group of children are now pursuing the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones onto the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide awareness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa houses &quot; Mig@@ rants &quot; on their long voyage
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez has a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was released on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and will be released with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , which is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is guided by a 59@@ - year old Mexican , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden rings in ted@@ dy bear form .
the name is Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this top name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she itself ) became a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ an , who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - still hundreds of African and ha@@ ired migrants come here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come to a full small bus and off the upper part of the coast you start to call : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
it &apos;s rather quiet at the time , but during this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on board boxes .
she does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them , and brings them to the hospital if she is sick , she buys them drugs that they cannot be paid , they massage with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sts one of the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived short of time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him whether my m@@ om is an appropriate lace name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family of Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a man &apos;s mou@@ sta@@ che ) po@@ yed with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to get there their husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take a normal stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other descendants of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest of Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ kaner is often travelling together the route and that Afri@@ kaner is able to speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a builder for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sells S@@ IM cards to save the necessary money to buy the book ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you that their guests will often send text messages when they are gone to gr@@ ate them or to tell her about the course of her journey .
they declared that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ sica &apos;s Valen@@ cian .
in this winter , Valencia and his family settled in their little house .
it is Po@@ lic@@ it and has found that the bu@@ ckets of bu@@ ckets are sold to a number of African mig@@ rant workers .
he began to help them , get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , washing machine and a cooking outside .
Valen@@ cian explained that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what you experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children before people who wanted to press money , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , one @-@ one @-@ one , has offered him roof .
a few months later the family dwells still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
during the course you can consult the trav@@ ellers through their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about it that her house is full , but she is no@@ stal@@ gic , because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she cri@@ es in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fol@@ klore , which you made a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers , boy and old .
she laugh@@ s sad , while she asks her for a short time .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ zz , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users is to be removed from the floor .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users received a mobile notification in the Tian@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in this message , the app is said to have access to terrorist information from it . &quot;
however , the authorities must use the app for more than the fight of terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because they had installed the app shortly after they had installed the app .
in the announcement of the police , the app could determine the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ age of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users inv@@ ent how much time they spend online , and to remote control your own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors will help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can be used in a variety of ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers may capable to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China are usually focused on the experience of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is quite often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme interest rates and surveillance measures and rout@@ in@@ ely web circuits .
based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( to be brought back ) , the cen@@ sored news in China showed photos of a Check@@ point where polic@@ emen were log@@ ged properly then whether it had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you &apos;re working on a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
that is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
that is a form of captivity by the control technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old food . ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting from the fact that the software can lift the characteristic needs of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are used to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the town council to minim@@ ize the prevalence of illegal content .
all government branch , authorities and with the party @-@ related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an US American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree entitled to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell@@ phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this action violated the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible fare , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after Death
a cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in a series of &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and specify that you are all alone in one place where everything is gone .
everything has turned into and dissolved , and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one that has fallen down in a list of feelings and expressions , that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you bring back the reality and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all of the doubts are divided up in smoke , and you &apos;ll be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of the disaster . to you it is clear that you are tra@@ pped between the walls , which have set your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone erected in stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the security services formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he presented his power over us , as he even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we know .
five young people were torn in peaceful protests , such as dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was sufficient for the city that the city was crushed in the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the city &apos;s cov@@ eted awards , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , for a false time , even if I had no high demands on a city , which up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their comp@@ lications are sil@@ enced .
during the third night , things had a little calm after the power supply of the neighborhood had to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence , in writing several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice against the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt enough to meet together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a wonderful image that had filled my expectations and fully filled .
in such a moment you realize that you are delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you swal@@ low down - nothing can return to your voice after you have destroyed them all the way up to the office of the Security Service .
I got there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let me hear , as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ age@@ ous enough to cry , if we are not in the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t dare to see me in your eyes and don &apos;t sit on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my foolishness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my business as I answered : &quot; I would not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment which could have such disa@@ stro@@ us consequences for me , and yet no mention of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the same in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father the same with that . &quot;
the cont@@ ention of this curse set lies down to me today in the nose .
he became an &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture , which I had been subjected to months .
I were scre@@ ened in the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I bear with myself .
thereafter again through the farm and the second office , which leads through a course to the individual cells .
I sing all the details exactly before I set the room .
otherwise , otherwise , they gave me a larger cell .
I have to share them with only one other prisoner and may set me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes felt like a whole life , the civil servants went out the cell , and I turned back to a well @-@ tried communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my fellow soldier was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ aw@@ ling . &quot;
after long , he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a respec@@ t@@ ful man of the middle age who looks like me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no distinctive fac@@ tions to me , and there are not doctors here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers connect his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the larger cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would have rejoiced if I remain .
liar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ che in order to distribute all these herbs , which are lab@@ elled against the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 pm in the evening ; always at this time the cry of the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light , presented to the ridge in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; thunder , &quot; play on the 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
that was the secret to protect the state of state , and to prevent the terrorists in contact with us , they speak at the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational erotic map and betrayed the close vision of their world view .
this is not a house where there is no country ; it is a curse to which they call co@@ exist@@ ance to transform the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I cared for the hearing and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man . at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the expressions used to tell him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my young , you are still young , you can join this day and protest to demonstrations , who will soon be able to find an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t tell any more , when insul@@ ts and strokes within a friendly communication for me have become an ordinary communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed myself to be punished , although I had done nothing to earn this sentence .
a penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; confession &quot; . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe that probably dates back to the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker , delight in your scre@@ ams .
give him a pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your cri@@ es back .
my cry did not suff@@ ice him enough yet to cast the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage ler , or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables to each other , in order to present the great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them changes , while I still was in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice was that I heard .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling down , and found no pleasure in it , for which he had access to an electrically charged rod .
flow through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my half @-@ half body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option .
some hours passed , who came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering with the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ve youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make sorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and hur@@ ry to you , you will be la@@ yed . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian rap@@ pers Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community , free opinion of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ ib smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib ver@@ ts the majority of its time inside . he sil@@ en@@ eth on his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what one can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers , or his ni@@ cot@@ ine lips to discover .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year that Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ low@@ y@@ een ( around : Farmer ) .
for more than six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and asks its alt@@ itudes of gender , sexu@@ ality and free opinion of expression by art and rap@@ ing music .
with his music that focuses on topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian geograph@@ er , he calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these themes do not only find in his home town Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that extend from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ ib himself sees himself as someone who is not limited in his mind through limits , and he can feel with people living under the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not open it openly , he turns against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib looked at his art in a studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , anything that was born with his identity as &quot; Palestinian Ge@@ omet@@ ry of the second generation &quot; - so he called himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life u@@ pris@@ ings , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib was stressed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he is dissolved in water , the holy month of Ram@@ adan . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is provided for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently , H@@ da@@ ib made a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions , and on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the mu@@ zzle is warm coffee and the sweat of the k@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first place of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look into the neighboring countries .
from hence , it is easy to do fundamental things - as to the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water , not to land in jail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliamentary institutions that support the Islamic Action Plan - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ tier in Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contrary to the cultural and traditional standards of the country , speaks and the main reason for the concert passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press spokesman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs as the Arab Spring , human rights and free opinion of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , who provides the old proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a valued the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which still decided to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably is probably not easy to be sil@@ ken rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually clearly reflected in the crystal clear reality in Jordan , which clearly becomes clear in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib stir@@ red traditional sex or@@ men to body by having formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ iced sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a evi@@ dently unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should actually trust .
over the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ or &apos; of Hon@@ or &apos; has risen in Jordan - the un@@ official one .
according to Human Rights Watch the number of Hon@@ or in 2016 reached its climax . however , the institutional infrastructure is still missing to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species .
according to a law on the Crime of Crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of their family @-@ famili@@ al violence , &quot; and for their liberation , often a long @-@ term bureau@@ cratic effort as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music is well pleased with great popularity and is well @-@ known to reject the topics , which in his country long as tab@@ u g@@ old .
H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is political , however , is a dream that he can not split his music , which is full of exp@@ ort@@ ations on sexu@@ ality , freedom and freedom of expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he was dealt with politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; , H@@ da@@ ib took over the question of the Palestinian Ident@@ ity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; there is a focus on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically distinct in the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song he repeated a verse times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get what you want , &quot; - be Faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bian , and that comments on equality of L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still greatly cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were torn out of the context and had been cen@@ sored according to his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , but he was only a modified version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib advert@@ ises the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not respond to Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ as , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory today thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ as was supposed to work once again on the order of the cali@@ ph in the eighth century , why could Jordan did not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the Sem@@ iti@@ c Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government imposed attacks on the free opinion of expression and the progressive colon@@ ization was brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news services adopted several former government officials and members of the teaching forces , argu@@ ing that they were critical in the commentary in social media about the problems related to corruption in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is therefore only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan Valley .
for him , Pro@@ jo@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a is now rel@@ ying for him for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks from slow , reasoned and inner changes . it is sure that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib was dre@@ aming , as millions of other Arabs also , of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of it , his work , to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be ann@@ ul@@ led with music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness , and not through bombs , stre@@ et@@ itions and artificial kind , the demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he is hoping for this .
until that time , H@@ da@@ ib is going to continue until it is far , and it is also possible to resist .
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Rep@@ orting , which A@@ man belongs to the student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories on the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
it is assumed that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also recorded in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , drums and dancing over a thousand years were recorded in the armies from west Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi in the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are to be seen .
nevertheless for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true , and yet another amazing way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high ball@@ room was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vian exchange weapons for sc@@ issors and straight razor

rarely , the outer appearance and body care were as important as in this history , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime , and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as to promote the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drugs are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of the region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru is experienced as many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ dres@@ sers of famous sports such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to attract more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can form@@ ulate them .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the utmost borders of fantasy and creativity , even an annual event inspired by the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show how you can see the most accurate sc@@ opes as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitors can be found on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as School August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people for their weapons of hair@@ sty@@ ling tools and instead of poor advice given to them to find jobs .
motivated by this activity and the offering possibilities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school was offered to special training workshops in March beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of being of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the message &quot; Liebes@@ bidden to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who are e@@ ased out to opp@@ ose aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cri@@ sti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters for Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) , the young people encouraged and write letters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international applied the sign@@ atories of the peace agreement as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received a Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , the Colom@@ bian is still a long way until one can speak of a real prop@@ iti@@ ation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who had been living in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and around the clock , their weapons have to be integrated in life as a civilian .
the Colom@@ bian society again , which acc@@ uses to life in constant fear and in some cases , had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed toward gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now hold them in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian ships came together and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly the same : until now thousands of young people have written letters - lovers of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - that should be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash sat@@ yar@@ ti in 2014 , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people that we love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s day , but those who need them need much more need@@ ful .
he left , he told us to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent need .
thus , the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a history of war to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I would never thought that someone would be forgiven . &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the UN stock in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled to the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC met so on how they had done earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ stitution of people from the whole country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings could walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between in between , &quot; says the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this memorable experience :
after we delivered the letters , a former fighter led me to the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ code &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the village nap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written to me so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran the tears of che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was feeling the war , and was sorry for all the years of faithful companions to be a fighter , and willing to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as war . the F@@ ARC joined the F@@ ARC , was the only possibility to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I would have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society outside , which is waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned to learn how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
as a pre@@ lu@@ de , students and some of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insights into their views about the peace process . &quot; for many years we experienced the opportunity of developing ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who have never found hearing , and had no right to vote , and to know that people that I often have seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned up@@ side by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the truth , in which the country lives , does hurt me .
but it comforts me that all people - also those who have been killed and so much harm caused to bring us something , and can give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for instance Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian has been declared that peace would reign after the de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of peace .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack weapons to rise and to protest for their rights . and this is also totally justified ( ... ) .
we now use the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the Defender of Peace - regardless of which race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong to - above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , our contribution to our contribution , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . to those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but we will overcome them together .
a trans@@ woman talks about the persecu@@ tions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life from Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ am@@ sum@@ owa and published its first publication on the OC Media website .
hom@@ osexual men and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - such discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ ortion .
with fear , activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that is based on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community just depends on the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q community .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who had shared some of their experiences with us and talked about it , which currently happens in the Republic .
after several months , the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines in several months , after reports were published , which in@@ scri@@ bed torture , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ an@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who captured the susp@@ icious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a lady , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
as early as her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , her conscious that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she went to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the intercourse of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
she went out of fear for her life in the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I have been working as a volunteer helicopter in a human rights organization .
one day , someone was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who stuck in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone , from whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can overcome these shame ? &quot;
thereafter the photos of my documents made by the whole of W@@ hat@@ s@@ app the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was there , I heard a couple of shopping blocks from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice say , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt something in my body , but did not hurt me .
then I heard another phrase , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honour the family , do you cry ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the last end of the hospital .
apparently , some women had got along everything and began to shout .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I vent@@ ured two j@@ elling in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which case report you were laid - in which the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and laid me for the women .
to this end , I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats thre@@ ats thre@@ ats .
they called me , and wrote me , saying , Stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ life .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the requested to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie .
they reported lack of claims : some said I had to prove it by moving up without the streets ; others wanted me to show at the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and I say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just locks , and Photos@@ hop .
I have gra@@ dient size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic has disappointed .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must van@@ ish from here . &quot;
it became too much for my mother and put a sn@@ ares for his neck .
and the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later the window stood by a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 down .
after the third time it happened , I was clear that something was la@@ zy .
my hands of human rights checked the number@@ ing plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the land , but then something unexpected happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new S@@ IM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without having to register , without a reference , without anything .
I broke my old S@@ IM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
came and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the S@@ IM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you are in security , just because you have left the country ?
you know , our people know , in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex . however , this is a t@@ ending topic .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still bear in myself .
I also wish to be able to overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really give my effort to see how the person remembers , that they remember out of their past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who are d@@ ord@@ ed ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who lost one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan was not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of the Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
to this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these worry about the problem with the affected person and at the end a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood is experienced .
OC Media : are now even gay men recorded in these secrets ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there would be not many .
if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or left the relatives of their relatives , to put the Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present it as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but targeted to radi@@ ate themselves .
OC Media : is this now only an idea or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m going to be imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was involved , when these people were taken along .
however , they were not introduced as a band until now , there were no reports to date . however , we dis@@ cour@@ aged that such actions are quite possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave it ?
do you know if these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already been held in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair forever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the C@@ aria was seen , I had never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally intended to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were kno@@ cked ; I had painted eyelashes , wore tubes and short t@@ ops .
the Interior Ministry of the Sch@@ aria never has a hair bent to me .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met .
we were never off@@ ended .
there is a phrase in the Che@@ chen language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say to children , if they make funny fun .
OC Media : so you simply have sealed their eyes before you because they believed you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never ch@@ ased and never defeated .
OC Media : how long does this grace mean ?
Sab@@ rina : so long , until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking about moral television .
he spoke not about us by se , but primarily as the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how human beings began to change in the city .
who had seen and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ shi@@ ped .
OC Media : which activity do you go after ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I won &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much .
apart from that , I &apos;m still active as a activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I am communic@@ ating with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , toge@@ ther@@ soever , I pay them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I have not suffered a cent for this .
I discovered these people myself , when I ab@@ ap@@ per@@ ched myself .
I am mus@@ ky and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is the best .
such is nature , that has indeed nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you know with foam in front of the mouth , there is no gay there for them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an who , the Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , have the Russians , who have the Russians too , but in the whole planet it gives them - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is un@@ pleasant to hear something .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practiced Muslims who go to the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan , live together with men .
you know , many think about Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ sting .
these are two different things - two different types of sensitivity to be exact , different food settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner , or not .
sorry that I will be here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all about it - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ ns an increase of self @-@ murder within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty in the native Arab population suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty .
since the last few months there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ nings .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 moved the desp@@ air situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , in the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ ov@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the ancest@@ or in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ allow@@ able for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come up for his family , such as Ah@@ wa@@ zi rights groups that work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video set on YouTube , holding the moments when he had set up himself .
some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames , and Mor@@ ov@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that doctors could not do anything more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide who created in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ minority , and activ@@ ates the activists that could take the lives of more men .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ked Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have log@@ ged in .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers , who felt themselves because of persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and un@@ able to feed their families and to work in a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community lived in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to den@@ ounce its life &apos;s life .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z became a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and took over 1925 great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ v@@ z Region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable useful spaces for the Iranian farming .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population gets only little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and expend@@ itu@@ res .
the Iranian regime denied the ancestors of the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arab@@ ians in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of dem@@ ns , the waters of Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , fel@@ man and gh@@ om are lying .
these dam@@ s have led only to destroy devast@@ ation in the region by drying , and destroy local agriculture as well as fish@@ eries and palms .
the unemployment rate among the Arab groves has now risen to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ president , for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are seeking a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a further school and have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , declared Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and cultural ethnic discrimination , &quot; said to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi males .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more than worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ah@@ wa@@ z , an@@ ew with anti @-@ Arabic discrimination and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adju@@ sting process :
since officials and institutions are not pre@@ fers to set up Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be able to access the job opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regim@@ es that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and to force them to earn their hab@@ it out of their home ancest@@ or .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be positioned , because Arab names cannot be toler@@ ated at the workplace , because speaking the speaking of Arabic language or the tragedy of Arabic clothing .
in view of the given circumstances that need to endure the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , the human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation explo@@ ded .
it remains to wait if the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .

&quot; why I uni@@ denti@@ sts me with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ ruption not &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide l@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read reviews in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as interactive femin@@ ists call - with Fr@@ ust .
they are surprised , why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally ought to be femin@@ ist * within .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men .
women are still under severe observation if it is about what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still ensured that women earlier , or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and well known .
I am persuaded about it and I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from Di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention , what kind of being physically and verb@@ al , both in and beyond femin@@ ist movement , caused many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ cular femin@@ ists .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to gather &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institutional form of motiv@@ ating violence , which we exposed black women to two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ as and liber@@ als were less deser@@ ve than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ as and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all males and all men every person , neither skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman to consider to consider the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , that relate to both the gender as well as on the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and I &apos;m not going to fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected .
according to their speech , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a deci@@ de@@ dly and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature in the black woman .
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program in order to drive their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to define white women the importance of the cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the meaning of black women to the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honour them better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ se@@ cular femin@@ ism was founded in order to bor@@ row women between different approach and limits to the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to join me and completely join the femin@@ ism movement and join me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who has been called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so hard to use for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so hard that interfer@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before we define black women after our own ideas and take us into the sp@@ ouses that we have created for us .
Cl@@ ar@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a bl@@ ur@@ ism : how to conquer ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how to define ourselves by ourselves ) . and not only that - black women may also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the spiritual , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped .
although some white and interactive femin@@ ists are immediately called separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , because I have existed in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am acknowledged as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a field , in which my life was neither covered , nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ nd versus the pollution : the mission of a man , the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts towards environmental problems .
in the context of an content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is re@@ published here again .
over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ boards or in can@@ oe . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who tells us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of contamination on its church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river which we lost than I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fears that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution , and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ fall Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ Vol@@ Alliance - which works against it and continues to protect the rivers , bro@@ oks and water routes in Iraq , as well as the local municipalities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a contains the gravity and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and multi@@ media journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and published in Iraq .
the emphasis on her work is based on a little substantial sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video photography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with the help pressed congregations that can tell their stories in their way .
Paraguay Women and her difficult fight against violence

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ ter ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commander said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against violence .
since the end of their relationship a little time has passed and the police said , their testimony would be laid to the files , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed a lack of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was useful as well .
a few days later , the second woman went back to her ad .
the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women receive at all once , they do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women also depend on the men who abuse themselves . this also explains why only 20 % of all women to admit to the victims of violence at all in the law en@@ forcement authorities .
content 1 beats and Stati@@ sti@@ ken@@ 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that is nothing under sub@@ strate &apos;s laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation , and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really abuse are mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a soci@@ o @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of ads come from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these off@@ ences are actually displayed . &quot; on every woman who will not be scre@@ ened in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who are reimbur@@ sed for physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay was not a separate criminal , the law en@@ forcement authorities may not be adequ@@ ately documented how many women will be murdered each year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days , a woman dies due to violence through men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not accept anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning , she really wanted to do that , but she was supposed to repent .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . but for two years she had the psychological violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable at most difficult :
I would have never thought that I would have been offering victims of abuse .
when I read it earlier , I always thought that the only women who are sub@@ contra@@ cted , because they let themselves be fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to con@@ vey that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mariana to ask why she had liked so long of Carlos and did not leave it before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least had a certain contribut@@ or to it .
Victoria Santos , which dates back to Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner had mi@@ stre@@ ated it .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all living in some way victims of abuse .
in the group they can speak with others about their experience , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of the women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as Advert@@ is@@ ements in the authorities remained without result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
she carried out a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native land , where it was mainly owned by money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent implementation
&quot; there are many laws in Paraguay , which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen E@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems at the use of the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d into an independent sentence and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , in some points , the legislative text was changed in some points , so that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are ruled that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years in jail .
the original bill had intended to take place most of the ( bureau@@ cratic and economic ) process to carry out the victims of violence itself , if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation , to state the state .
Ik@@ h@@ ri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature does not provide a sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ human relations .
a re@@ union needs to take place here , so that violence is no longer considered a while .
whoever keeps silent in view of these facts , makes a deb@@ tor and helps to escape the perpet@@ rators .
we must reimbur@@ se such a long report , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is not considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , there was a passage that the partners had been calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions of the changes are apart .
the passage concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

an independent media continues in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the Venetian authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of her reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he is serving a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri were arrested and placed before the court , but later returned .

the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists , remember to express their views on the country &apos;s public matters , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closing and imprisonment three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inception in 2007 , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , filed an article entitled &quot; High Pri@@ ority Parties &quot; of the judi@@ ci@@ ary , which was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . it was corruption and the mixture of high @-@ ranking officials in the judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court acquitted al @-@ Ab@@ ri acquitted on 26 December 2016 , and Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned to one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal over@@ turned the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision made by the court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper was exposed to attacks by the Korean government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement which was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Secretary personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister had another time against the decision of the Appeals Court to return the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was injured in Oman in recent times .
for further injuries , for example , closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Korean authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work .
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country , and

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , representation is made with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not even mentioned in the media . it is a growing range that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on @-@ site medical research : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , the research , which is conducted by African scientists himself , is being able to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
it grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic which showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored himself the HIV virus , before he decided to go home back home to support the Croatian health system .
with global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of media about these research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratories .
moreover , I just start a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion of the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions that we are received are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : the United States and Europe .
the projects are encouraged to be different .
it is difficult to find people back or want to move back here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what kind of obstacles are there in your routine research that you didn &apos;t like before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion regarding the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they concentrate , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need of special scientific training , starting from each age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research around the world , the healthcare sector ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : many times it is the limited speed to do things , and the clear access to scientific expertise that represent the challenges here .
the system that magazines are available only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , is limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; plant producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on website En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine that reports about solution for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank M@@ orton has been scre@@ ened in the USA since the 1980s .
its company provides 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant which was grown by NASA @-@ a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ al &apos;s work has been lost only by its own income and the question how many kinds of oint@@ ments can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noted that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not be able to breed so further .
the patents are not only used for individual sorts , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or tra@@ pped leaves .
over the last few years , more such patents have been registered to growing crops such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to these trends , plant bre@@ e@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , M@@ orton def@@ ected forever , but it is longer necessary for this reason , since his work continues to be more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , than would lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ der , in order to swe@@ ating myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus we have to do that now , but it is a break with breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sal@@ ads , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so , so as good as possible and tries to prop@@ ably those features , which he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ oring not to use material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also been connected to a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have re@@ bo@@ red the species Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it &apos;s no coincidence that this name sounds pretty much more than would the movement come from the IT area and not from the sphere of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software to inspire the alternatives to ur@@ gently protected software .
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and agents are not protected as intellectual property and so for plant bre@@ e@@ ders are permanently usable .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ e@@ ders can also commit to be able to freely use the seed out of them .
this , however , does not mean that they can &apos;t continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ e@@ ders only allow others who want to cross their seed , and it will not be out of different - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ern@@ ities .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dis@@ covering prospects
Professor Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is a member of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds also plays a role in larger con@@ feder@@ ations such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ e@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by providing seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not dealing with genetically altered plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , are expected to buy products from ecological agriculture and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which , for example , is offered on commercial markets such as the markets , should also know that the way of this vegetables is cultivated , as such vegetables are cultivated .
food sovereignty without seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative undertake to keep others their seed still free at their disposal . in contrast , their predi@@ ction is to be patented in contrast to seeds and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supports argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available genital pool is due to the increasingly popular intellectual property rights on plant materials , which is therefore always restricted to shr@@ inking .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of O@@ ss@@ i , employs itself in their doctoral thesis with genetic variation at carrots and their availability . it found that about one @-@ third of all sub@@ fleet features are protected as intellectual property , which means it is either not use@@ able for plant bre@@ e@@ ders either .
other plants are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by dis@@ cour@@ aged that mass@@ en@@ ish plants were patented like wheat in a greater style , as side salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ it
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics , such as their taste or their colour enh@@ ances up to those who prosp@@ er in certain environments because of which they prosp@@ er in certain environments .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is increasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ cts acknowle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activity . with a total of four gender banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Agri@@ cultural Ministry of the United States set up the company to preserve the genetic diversity .
it does not contradi@@ ct that intellectual property , other bre@@ e@@ ders , because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovations . &quot; a patent is basically taken as a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result .
such protection is not in@@ hib@@ ited to innovations , but it promotes more material and know @-@ how by the public . &quot;
M@@ orton does not look like this : 20 years to wait until a patent pending , you certainly does not tap any innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long , to be able to breed plants , which have been adapted to the altered environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost .
but the main argument for M@@ orton is that genetic resources have always been a common condition and continued to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ e@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ochro@@ me inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , M@@ orton interfer@@ es with the concept to pat@@ rol plant features : &quot; we do not create the features ourselves .
they form themselves as bre@@ e@@ ders themselves and as bre@@ e@@ ders , we finally have no idea of how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who are breeding a variety , has its own values in it .
those who are working on industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ators , for which cultivation her@@ b@@ icides are needed , stimul@@ ates into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as are moving on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents ) , it can survive the majority of smaller seed companies , also without having to survive it or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant engineer Frank M@@ orton requires sal@@ ads in his breeding garden Sal@@ ate .
photo by Karen M@@ orton .
M@@ orton is also that bre@@ e@@ ders would be innovative by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ enting : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new products , stronger than enterprises that pat@@ ron@@ ed .
I need constantly new stuff for my catalogue , because I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years is protected from competition , so in my opinion it is quite easy to make . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
indeed , the US seems to be leading to the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept has meanwhile spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , creating a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed sector , the center with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties , which meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed , and to sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ e operates at an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for the breed of land differ from country to country , to which the O@@ ss@@ i commitment is not simply to be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Commission , the European Commission , explains that conventi@@ onally bred plants should not be pat@@ enti@@ able . thus , she talks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventional plants .
however , a statement is not a law yet ; now it is entitled to the governments of the Member States to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for sponsor@@ ing seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &quot; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , is that the organization currently moun@@ ts a global alliance of &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , which will begin the next year of official starting signal .
a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , international non @-@ profit organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Conc@@ entr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide , to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map , .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for Future of Ess@@ ence - a group of relief organisations such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report . it represents the belief that farmers will have the opportunity to share them and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food supplies .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i , hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly respected where and how something grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clari@@ fy people that are still more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the newest aims of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August the Egyptian government announced the website of the New Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) that documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue their work and efforts to respect human rights in the region .
the book Network for Human Rights Information continues : despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian right and the constitution because it was never so difficult to pursue these targets in this part of the world . however , even though it was never so difficult to overcome these goals , so it was not so important to overcome the lock and do not follow . we ins@@ ist to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first @-@ cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent News page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic language of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era Network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web side lock@@ ings to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language h@@ tt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ I@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the dissemin@@ ation of colum@@ ns and articles that he writes in Egypt for not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , whom he raised in order to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ iti@@ c of the Egyptian government , was the goal of a attack .
B@@ logger , who is home to Zi@@ adas blog , is also accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while it was reported on the student protests and capture a video as the police forces physical violence against two students .
his articles turn mainly for politics and human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed its locking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to un@@ lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ ay@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs is not meaning@@ ful for the world , it is because of two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been successful to medi@@ ate me the feeling of skill , arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading of the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs , as well as any other web site which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the item of articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have closed it and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ age@@ ous go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) locked Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 pages . this gave technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers by making it possible for Internet access and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we became aware of the lock of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such a practice refers to the intention of the government to block content and filter it , to filter and filter access to the Egyptian users .
the situation is also wor@@ m@@ ated in addition to the fact that the f@@ ens@@ ur@@ ities are closed behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population to have no legal status , with which they can proceed in judgment against those actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and whom will she attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil , with gri@@ ps head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the second day a police officer was murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ be smo@@ ked pharmacy with military arms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8,@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ af@@ ee after Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a forced financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
even the United Nations , Brazilian NGO , called Global Justice to intervene .
reports like these are all everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16th August the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now released there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ ality , etc . everything that happens in Rio will be released in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative way , so as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minutes video that was dealt on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure to be :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognise the war .
in the same video there was a journalist in the newspaper , that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories there is to be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we realize that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , if it is dist@@ orted , atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot and then asks questions to be missed .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
are the term &quot; war &quot; more than it used it ?
in an article on the News portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist argued that violence as &quot; war &quot; is argued to describe the violence as &quot; war &quot; . this may be more difficult for a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and might be difficult to educ@@ ate responsibility in the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra for the analysis of the military interest rate in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ counter@@ feit negle@@ ct of the public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

among these security policy actions also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ mo@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela police , and a unity lasting permanently .
in the beginning this actually resulted in a decrease in for@@ ce@@ ful deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP was to protect the U@@ PP after several reports about the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit , which was to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not correspond to the &quot; Civil War &quot; criteria for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for the human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this requires the state to use their means and ways that are typical for war . this includes the penetration into the territory of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wander@@ ing balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b , currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly strongly affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 required the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition , on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these people have stood under siege under siege under the siege of Damascus , which led to a population on local or through tunnels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ point , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they themselves call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nearby and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala NGO .
fung@@ i does not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its nutritional activity makes it an attractive food source for many people of the besieged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said in contrast to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value as meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , an organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years has been fighting this project and pressed his relief , that it is now more and more &quot; to gain popularity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ low@@ da &apos;s humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as .
it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families to the plant of pil@@ es , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel short@@ age , locally produced steam made of plastic are used to power the altern@@ ators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of pilgrims from the region &quot; production , before they checked up their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
after that they planted a small Pil@@ gri@@ m farm in a tub . when this was done they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Teacher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout east G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ ic@@ ulture from different reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breach of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating food ( such as paper , tea , coffee size , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new food@@ stu@@ ffs .
the creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
to create new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired people in crisis areas and can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested the 21st of October in many neighbour@@ hoods in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires that gr@@ assi@@ fied in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two people were killed and approximately 70 were injured as a consequence of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 light@@ nings breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy was held in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest management system that the wood@@ land is monitored by satellite photos , in 2017 alone , there are about 500,000 acres of forest in Portugal - an area of the area &apos;s size in Lisbon .
so that you can do a better picture of the Ernst of the location : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
completely Portugal is in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ans ) October 15th , 2017
some of the Twitter users divided into pictures :

numerous videos spread in the network and show images that allow better insights into the creature :
the se@@ clu@@ able tragedy
the target of the protest from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive relief measures and fire fighting action by the state .
people ask themselves why the civil protection was not able to in@@ con@@ serve the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything .
this Sunday they did not do that : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the roads were locked very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits will take place in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ism with a high rate of fire .
a comprehen@@ sible proposal for the Wal@@ tr@@ form , which the government had filed under grave fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant had an open back@@ door , so it was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trans@@ verse @-@ organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large surfaces with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus trees made from light burning wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind still spread .
in addition to these problems , Portugal &apos;s website of Civil Protection was added to Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents seeking information or attempted to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the location and the spread of fires .
the project was founded in 2015 by the developers Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so decisive that the server could not resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users that followed the fires , which was more than half a million years ago .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

one night in the autumn of 1994 , the Taliban kicked off Afghanistan by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ y@@ ed@@ in groups , who had conquered the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government , and Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
just at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was one 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan women for the last time with his family dinner together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t tell it then , she knew that she would not see her son very long again - maybe even more .
in the morning of dawn the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly conservation .
the Taliban , known for their hate on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban , came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was difficult and sick .
then he took that which was left out of his low wages and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign land along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar which were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
today , like today , Afghan refugees were min@@ ted in Iran about misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af came in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon before open windows , so that we don &apos;t drow@@ ned at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared himself for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and ra@@ vel@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day to food in need .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to a relatively high point of asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that conditions to find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astro@@ phic .
the Human Rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering under a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special adv@@ anta@@ geous centres . there are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared workers . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to an emergency centre if they officially granted a motion for asylum - which may go up for months after registration of asylum .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ b@@ aff@@ ection@@ ful life of life helped him to free himself from these conditions .
after having made different work in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af occupied his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well , that after a while he had a second hostel and a fast food outlet .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentation &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution based on the way to other European countries .
over the last years , some of Afghanistan managed businesses , including cutting eries , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna , and the S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals tend to go far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y industry and retail trade , and aim back to the country that he had to leave un@@ ri@@ v@@ edly as teenagers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know my people suffers .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also works plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where humans will learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crop excess on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; he says .
the development for the successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghanistan on this path .

the Egyptian parliament has a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government authority .
users would have to be able to use the social networks within six months after the submission of the bill , based on the agency , stating their complete name as well as its ID number .
he who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the penalty of a criminal payment .
the law , which was advert@@ ised by sixty members of Parliament , is currently the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another dep@@ uties gave a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the defence of the president or high officials .
under Egyptian law the interests of the President and state facilities are already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the law , there would be such an act with prison and fin@@ es , right wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in jail for the convicted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would be a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against prot@@ esters , which demonstrated against the military coup that led to the counterpart of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 applicants , who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th May , because the Trial Chamber failed to bring the accused of prison in the court hall .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , appearance exposure of other arms , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary were free . they were charged for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .

will China be forced to force the users of social media to provide their identification ?
according to new regulations for the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need approval in China before they write messages or share news in social media .

analy@@ tics dis@@ cour@@ aged that the elimination of anonymous comments are to be reached within the social network . until now , it is un@@ clear how the authorities apply these regulations .
in the social media , Chinese citizens proposed that these regulations can only selec@@ tively assess this regulations to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence .
